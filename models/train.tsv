0	0	a	In his “Mad Money Lightning Round, host Jim Cramer said that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has had a terrific quarter and it is going to go higher. Whosoever is bearish about the stock does not know about streaming video. NFLX was up 2.04% to close at $50.97. In after hours trading, NFLX soared 17.15% to $59.71. Jim gives a double thumbs up to Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK), which he thinks is performing well. For Brown Shoe (NYSE: BWS), he says that it is historically undervalued and offers a terrific buy. CHK’s shares lost 2.26% to close at $25.93, while, BWS’s shares inched up 0.08% to close at $12.87. Jim was not ecstatic about Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and said that he prefers other companies in this sector. JNJ still went up 1.04% to close at $63.44. When asked about Mittal Steel (NYSE: MT), Jim said that he would prefer Nucor (NYSE: NUE) to MT. NUE is an impressive company that offers great dividend. Although MT lost 0.27% yesterday to gain 0.79% in pre-market trading, NUE’s shares dipped 2.23% to close at $42.59. Read more about Jim Cramer

Jim said that he still recommended Hot Topic (NASDAQ: HOTT), despite the fact that people were getting impatient on the stock. HOTT jumped 2.19% in the after hours session. Read more on Jim Cramer.
4	0	a	According to an article on TheStreet, buying opportunities created by metal sell-offs over the past two weeks will trigger gains in base metals during this week. Europe's debt woes and China's property concerns are likely to result in continued volatility in the markets. However, buying sentiment in the markets has further improved, led by speculation of a rise in Chinese demand, the South Korean government’s announcement to hold talks with North Korea to reduce tensions in the region and upgrades by Citigroup (NYSE: C) on metal stock. An expansion in China's demand for base metals is foreseen by the world's third-largest mining company Rio Tinto (NYSE: RTP). According to RTP’s CEO Tom Albanese, the demand for iron ore, aluminum and copper is going to double over the next 15 years. Yesterday in RTP’s annual general meeting, Chairman Jan du Plessis said, China's demand for iron ore, copper, coal and aluminum is expected to grow over the next 15 years, after which time we expect to see increasing demand from India. The long-term outlook, therefore, continues to make our business an attractive proposition. Analyst Brian Yu of Citigroup has confidence that metal stocks offer good value. He upped its rating for AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) to “buy” as he believes that price correction in the stock is overdone. However, Brian cut the earnings and price targets for the stock. By 1:07 pm, AKS had dropped 2.19% to $14.73. According to Yu, the base metal stocks that offer the maximum upside to investors include copper giant Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (NYSE: FCX), iron ore miner Cliff Resources (NYSE: CLF) and scrap-metal recycler Nucor (NYSE: NUE). By 1:07 pm, FCX had climbed 1.21% to $68.44, CLF had rallied 4.10% to $53.80 and NUE had appreciated 1.17% to $43.48. To see more trading ideas, click here.
5	0	a	Analysts at Deutsche Bank maintain their buy rating on Nucor (NYSE: NUE). The target price for NUE is set to $50. During the conference with Deutsche Bank, “Nucor characterized demand as stable and it views recent 'caution' in the supply chain as a reaction to lower metallic (scrap/iron ore) costs. Also, it doesn't expect scrap prices to remain under pressure for the balance of '10.” “An uncertain economic outlook is a limitation but acquisitions remain a priority for Nucor within each of its business units…. An equity investment operating 23 sheet processing centers in N. America; mainly leveraged to auto & appliance demand (75% of vols). Also, NUE doesn't believe NuMit threatens its mill customers and it will use this entity for further processing acquisitions,” the analysts say. More Analyst Ratings here
6	0	a	In his Monday’s “Mad Money Lightning Round” on CNBC, Jim Cramer said that several traders bought Chicago Mercantile Exchange (NYSE: CME) ahead of financial regulation. He mentioned that CME is a dominant player and he will continue to hold the stock. CME fell 1.01% yesterday. For Alcoa (NYSE: AA), Jim said that he did not like the way the quarter shaped up for the company. He added that the stock lacked momentum. He told traders that he prefers Nucor (NYSE: NUE), “where there's more upside potential. While AA lost 0.27%, NUE went down 0.02% in after hours. According to Jim, Atheros Communications (NASDAQ: ATHR) is another wireless communications company for which there is not much to write about. He told traders to invest in Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS) instead. SWKS added 2.03% in yesterday’s trading. When asked about Sears Holdings (NASDAQ: SHLD), Jim said, I would tell you that Sears sells into that first time homebuyers market that's fallen with the expiration of the tax credit. I'm going to stick my neck out and say buy it. SHLD moved up 0.03% in after hours trading. Jim said that he is on the buy side for Baidu.com (NASDAQ: BIDU) and will be reevaluating the stock only after the stock hits $90. After climbing 2.96% yesterday, BIDU added 0.10% in after hours. While all the biotechs are rising due to the takeover hype, Jim stressed that Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG) is not a takeover target. He mentioned that he would prefer to sell the stock now and buy it when the price falls.
7	1	a	Overview The Metals & Mining Industry encompasses the extraction (mining), as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output. The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars. Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal (MT), the world’s largest steel producing company, produced 73.2 million tons in 2009, representing 6% of the world's steel output. The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls. Anglo American Plc., the largest gold producer by market capitalization, dominates the gold industry. Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Corporation (GM), Ford Motor Company (F), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) and Honda Motor Company (HMC) are big consumers of metals, chiefly steel and aluminum. Outlook The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover, develop new deposits and boost reserves, while smaller ones own few mines and concentrate on them. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has historically been a critically important growth strategy for metal companies. While the slow economic recovery is a significant factor in short-term decisions regarding M&A activity, mining companies expect to make acquisitions over the next three years. The M&A activity is also supported by higher metal prices that have strengthened the financial positions of many mining giants. Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals, especially China and India. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could -- theoretically, at least -- double metal demand in the longer term. In recent years, capacity growth in China has significantly exceeded the growth in market demand. A continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in China’s rate of economic expansion could result in the country increasing its metal exports. Yet, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries. Developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery. Despite some concerns about its sustainability, China is expected to remain the largest consumer of metals in the future. Metals in Detail: Steel As the major shareholder (about 60%) in the metals market, the steel industry was strongly affected by the global economic downturn. Massive over-capacity is one of the major headwinds for steel, which continues to weigh on prices. Moreover, the industry has witnessed a number of trade disputes involving the U.S., in particular, the imposition of tariffs of up to 30% on imported steel. Rising raw material prices -- iron ore and coal (metallurgical) -- are also a major concern for the steel industry. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS), for instance, expects a 65% rise in benchmark iron ore prices in the near term. Demand in key metal consuming industries such as autos, shipbuilding and construction, continues to remain weak, forcing global metal producers to slacken output levels. While utilization levels have improved recently, steel makers were operating at less than 50% capacity last year. U.S. Steel Corporation (X) -- the eighth largest steel producer in the world, the largest integrated steel producer headquartered in North America and one of the largest integrated flat-rolled producers in Central Europe -- slashed production by almost 37% in 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO (PKX) had to scale down output by about 10.9%. Steel demand is reviving slowly, with improving end-markets on the back of a recovering global economy. Steel giant ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel are restarting furnaces or are planning to in the near future. Industry steel mill utilization rates have increased to above 70%. The current high in steel demand helped reverse losses for the third largest steel maker Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) and the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S., Nucor Corporation (NUE). Steel Dynamics’ second-quarter earnings of 22 cents reversed losses of 8 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, Nucor reported a profit of 29 cents per share in the second quarter of 2010, in contrast to a net loss of 43 cents per share in the same quarter of 2009. The World Steel Association expects a 10.7% increase in global steel demand this year and a further 5.3% gain in 2011 compared to 2010 level. The impetus is mostly expected from a surge in Chinese steel demand, which is likely to grow 6.7% to 579 million tons in 2010. But despite these improving trends, average selling prices are still struggling, as the pace of recovery in the U.S. and global markets is slow at best. The ongoing slowdown has marred prospects in the housing and construction sectors in the near term. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS), Nucor and Steel Dynamics have provided a bleak overall near-term price outlook, although they expect end-markets to stabilize. Collectively, AK Steel, Nucor and ArcelorMittal have a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) for the short-term (1 to 3 months), while we maintain our Neutral recommendation in the long term for all three, given the outlook for steel. However, Steel Dynamics holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) and has a long-term Underperform recommendation driven by a very weak earnings outlook. Gold The outlook for investment is positive overall, with absolute levels of demand likely to remain well supported by continued economic and currency uncertainty, inflation concerns and the search for diversification. In 2009, global gold supply exceeded demand by 15%, reflecting favorable gold prices. However, based on the marginal improvement in the economic environment in 2010, the World Gold Council expects an increase in demand for jewelry, which in turn will help global gold demand. A potential shot in the arm for the precious metal is the expected increase in central bank gold holdings, primarily as a diversification play. The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continues to rebound from the low levels in 2009, while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China in the next half of 2010. Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years. Concerns over the recent European debt crisis have also led to strong buying of gold coins, bars and gold exchange traded funds in particular. We saw gold demand and prices strengthen in the first six months of 2010, a trend that is likely to remain in place in the rest of the year. Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG). However, gold producers Newmont Mining (NEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices. Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this overall favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall neutral view on the space. Aluminum The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. Aluminum prices at the LME have plunged around 20% from their April highs to $1,969 per ton. The greatest risk for aluminum producers would be a further decline in aluminum prices. However, we expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa Inc. (AA), Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG) and Aluminum Corporation of China (ACH) should benefit from the improving demand outlook. In the medium to long term, Alcoa expects aluminum consumption to improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal. Alcoa now expects demand to grow about 10% to 12% in 2010. The aluminum giant predicts Chinese aluminum consumption to jump 21% and about 6.5% globally (excluding China) in 2010. Currently, Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver and Aluminum Corporation of China hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by a long-term Neutral recommendation. Copper Copper prices started on a downtrend in early July 2010 and are expected to remain volatile in the near term, which could be a major headwind for copper companies. Revenues and margins for copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO) were affected by the recent fall in copper prices and volumes, primarily driven by the slowing economic activities in China. However, the long-term view is favorable. Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. Copper companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand in copper in the developing markets. The near-term headwinds led to the short-term Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) and Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Freeport and Southern Copper, respectively. However, both companies have a Neutral recommendation on a positive long-term outlook.

9	0	a	The U.S. houses one of the world's largest steel industries. It is rather concentrated in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion's share of sales. ArcelorMittal (MT) is the world's largest steel company, with crude steel production of 73.2 million tons in 2009, representing about 6% of the global steel output. Steel products are classified into four broad categories: flat steel products, long steel products, scrap and semi-finished products. Flat products include plates, hot-rolled strip and sheets, and cold-rolled strip and sheets. The long steel product category comprises wire rods, beams, reinforced bars and merchant bars. The products under both these categories are rolled from steel slabs, which are considered as unfinished or semi-finished products that are generally not sold. Historically, the automotive and construction markets have remained the largest consumers of steel, absorbing more than half of the total steel produced. Large automakers such as General Motors (MTLQQ), Ford Motor Company (F), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) and Honda Motor Company (HMC) depend upon the steel industry. Other steel consuming industries include appliances, agricultural implements, converters, containers, energy, electrical equipment and industrial machinery. Growth Trends Accelerating demand in the automobile and construction markets triggered production growth in the steel industry before the recession hit. However, the global economic turmoil that started at the end of 2008 and continued through much of 2009 severely impacted both these markets, with the demand for steel nose-diving as a consequence. Steel manufacturers saw inventories soaring and scrambled to cut production. With the global economy picking up in late 2009, the steel industry started seeing signs of improvement. However, given its economic sensitivity, we expect global steel demand to improve only gradually, in line with the recovery in the user industries, especially automotive and residential construction. According to World Steel Association (“worldsteel”), steel demand in the U.S. was down 41.6% in 2009 at 57.4 million tons. However, with the economy in recovery mode, the industrial sector is expected to drive a 26.5% increase in steel demand in the U.S. in 2010 and a further 7.5% in 2011 to 78.1 million tons. The emerging economies reflected growth trends throughout the recession and are expected to continue to drive steel demand, going forward. Worldsteel expects steel demand in India to grow 13.9% and 13.7% in 2010 and 2011, respectively, following a growth of 7.7% in 2009. The European Union experienced a 35.2% decline in steel demand in 2009. Spain and Italy saw a significant fall in steel production with the breakdown of their construction market. According to the association, in 2010 the European region will see an increase of 13.7% in steel demand, driven by the restocking of inventory. Japan would see steel demand rising 10.3% in 2010 after a 31.7% fall in 2009. However, worldsteel expects Chinese steel consumption to increase by a modest 6.7% to 579 million tons in 2010, after an impressive 24.8% increase in 2009. Expansionary Chinese economic policies, easy credit and construction initiatives have thus far sustained demand. But with China attempting to rein in its overheated property sector and engineer a soft landing for its economy, steel demand will most likely soften noticeably in the coming months. Globally, worldsteel anticipates steel demand to rise 10.7% to 1,241 million tons in 2010 in contrast to last year's decline of 6.7%. For 2011, worldsteel expects global steel requirement to inch up 5.3% to 1,306 million tons. Production Scenario The year 2010 started well for the steel industry, with improving demand conditions in several end markets, leading to a steady rise in steel production worldwide. All major steel-producing countries -- Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Russia, Turkey, the U.S. and Ukraine -- have recorded healthy production so far this year. According to worldsteel, North American steel output jumped 50.3% year over year to 74.8 million tons in the first 8 months of 2010. However, it is still lagging the 19.4% growth rate seen in 2008. In the European Union, steel production shot up 37.5% to 115.6 million tons in the first 8 months of 2010 while production in Asia climbed 17.8% to 592.7 million tons. Of this, China experienced a 15.3% production growth to 425.7 million tons while Japanese production leapt 38.1% to 72.7 million tons over the first 8 months. Over the same period, steel production in Brazil soared 40.5% to 22.1 million tons and that in Russia jumped 15.4% to 43.8 million tons. In Ukraine, steel production moved up 11.7% to 21.2 million tons. Industry Capacity The global steel industry is capital intensive, cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity. Capacity utilization rates were, however, low (around 60%) at the beginning of 2009, in response to the much softer demand. With steel demand picking up in the latter half of the year, capacity utilization rates increased to above 70%. Utilization rates continued to increase in the first half of 2010, averaging at over 80%. The capacity utilization rate has, however, come down to around 70% again since then. Steel makers continue to add capacity besides resuming operations at the idled facilities, inspired by the expected rebound in steel industry in the longer term. Price Trends The steel industry has long witnessed volatility in prices with a large spot market. Steel prices rose steadily for most of 2008, after which there was a downtrend. Lower prices had an adverse effect on steel producers, who recorded lower revenues and margins, and had to write down finished steel and raw material inventories. The period witnessed major steel producers slashing production to minimize inventory accumulation. U.S. Steel Corporation (X), the fifth-largest steel producer worldwide, cut down production by almost 62% during the second quarter of 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO (PKX) cut production by about 15%. This was the first time in its history that POSCO was forced to adopt such a measure, proof of the very adverse operating environment. Although steel prices have been stabilizing since the latter part of 2009, it is significantly below the pre-crisis level. We believe that a sustained recovery in steel prices remains uncertain in the backdrop of sluggish economic activity. Factors Affecting Steel Prices Chinese Imports: The steel industry is also affected by fluctuations in steel import–export and tariffs. China is the largest steel producer globally, with the balance between its domestic production and consumption being an important factor in global steel prices. Consumers in the U.S. are importing cheaper steel from China, which is forcing domestic steel producers to sell at lower prices, and even at a loss, sometimes. To this end, the U.S. government has been imposing anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel imports. Concerns about the sustainability of economic recovery and question marks about China's growth momentum come into play in the pricing equation. This relatively uncertain China outlook, coupled with a still tentative recovery in the developed world, is expected to weigh on prices. Threat from substitutes: Steel has many substitutes like aluminum, which replaces it in the automotive markets. Cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood are also used as steel substitutes. This significantly influences market prices and demand for steel products. Raw Material Trends The key input for steel production is iron ore. Apart from this, coking coal and coke, scrap, electricity and natural gas are also used as inputs in steel production. The raw materials industry is highly concentrated with only three major players -- Vale (VALE), Rio Tinto (RTP) and BHP Billiton (BHP) – having significant pricing power. The risk lies in consolidation among raw material suppliers. For instance, the announced iron ore joint venture between mining companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto would further increase the pricing power of both the suppliers. Steel makers would face higher production costs if suppliers shift to sales based on spot prices from the long-term fixed price contract system, as spot prices for most of the raw materials, especially iron ore, remained high from 2006 through 2008. In 2009, iron ore prices, which are linked with the London Metal Exchange prices, were about 28% to 33% below the benchmark prices. Iron ore prices have remained volatile during most of 2010 and are expected to rise sharply in 2011. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) expects a 65% rise in benchmark iron ore prices in the near term. The company assumes reduction of its earnings by $11 million or $7 per ton for each 5% increase in iron ore prices. The prices of coking coal, zinc and nickel, as well as scrap, have followed a similar trend. Consolidation Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have remained an important business strategy in the steel industry. M&A activities prevent additional steel capacity, providing production efficiency and economies of scale. The biggest example is Mittal Steel's acquisition of Arcelor in 2006 and their merger in 2007. The Tata Steel and Corus merger in 2008 is another good instance of industry consolidation. The industry is likely to see more M&A activity in the coming years as the industry players prepare themselves for a recovery in the long run. Zacks Recommendation Iron ore pricing concerns have led to a negative outlook for steel manufacturers. Revenues and average selling prices are lower, as the U.S. and global markets are in a gradual recovery. In the short term, we are negative on steel manufacturers like AK Steel Holding Corporation, Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) and Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI). AK Steel's cost structure is higher than its peer group due to a greater reliance on an external supply of raw materials such as carbon scrap, purchased slabs, iron ore and purchased coke. Iron ore is the key raw material in steel manufacturing operations. The company expects to purchase about 6 million tons of iron ore pellets in 2010. One of the largest and most diversified producers of specialty materials in the world, Allegheny Technologies has forecasted operating losses in the near-term. Allegheny has been battling cost-pressures associated with high raw material costs. For Allegheny, a hypothetical $1.00 per mmbtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of about $10 to $12 million. Costs of scrap and oil are also rising significantly. A change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of about $80 million, while a hike of $0.01 per pound of ferrous scrap would result in increased costs of approximately $5 million. We remain strongly negative on Steel Dynamics, the third-largest steel maker in the U.S., who is operating its structural steel mills at less than 40% of its total capacity due to uncertain demand conditions. However, industry giants with integrated business models like U.S. Steel Corp and ArcelorMittal have an edge over their peers. Both steel makers have substantial captive sources of iron ore and coal and source about 75%–80% of their coke and iron ore requirements from owned and/or operated facilities. U.S. Steel Corp returned to profitability in the second quarter of 2010 on improving business conditions. Similarly, earnings of Nucor Corporation, the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S. , broke out from the loss territory in the last quarter of 2009. We expect Nucor to exhibit strong profitability driven by long-term contracts, cost reduction efforts and a dominant acquisition strategy. Collectively, ArcelorMittal, AK Steel, Allegheny Technologies, United States Steel Corporation and Nucor Corporation carry long-term Neutral recommendations, while Steel Dynamics has a long-term Underperform recommendation.

10	1	a	Here are last week's winners and losers among metals and mining stocks.
11	1	a	Cusick's Corner After the market's tight range yesterday and now again today, market watchers are taking notice of volatility's move to the upside -- specifically the VIX popping from 16 to 18. This is a little unusual considering the light volume, tight range and the offensive sectors, i.e. XLF, continue to catch a bid and show leadership to the upside. What has shaken the short-term support for the bulls is a well known sentiment indicator Put/Call Ratio, specifically the CBOE P/C Ratio is below .75. We have not seen this Ratio at that level since the beginning of November and it has been a signal for a potential turn in the short-term market segment. I am taking a contrarian perspective when looking at the P/C Ratio this way. While the market has all the momentum still clearly pointing to the upside, I keep an eye on this gauge for some potential signs of a market turn. See you After Hours. Stocks are trading mixed in uneventful market action through midday. Economic data was in focus early after the Conference Board reported that its index of Consumer Confidence fell to 52.5 in December, from 54.3 the month before. Economists were looking for an increase to 56.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was already trading lower ahead of the data, showed little reaction to the report. Action in the commodities market is getting some attention, as gold has rallied to new highs and crude oil is trading higher as well. But with not much other news to guide the action, there isn't much volatility and the Dow has traded in another narrow 39-point range. The industrial average is up 3 points at midday, but the tech-heavy NASDAQ is down 8.7. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) edged up .30 to 17.97. Options volume remains light, but a bit better than yesterday. 2.4 million calls and 1.6 million puts traded through 11:00 ET. Bullish Pfizer (PFE) shares are up 17 cents to $17.66 and PFE April 19 calls are today's most actively traded equity options contract through midday. 112,340 contracts have changed hands. Morning trades include two blocks of 40,570 contracts (X2) April 19 calls at 25 and 26 cents each. The bid and ask at the time was 24 and 26 cents. Open interest is only 572 contracts and so this is looking like an opening buyer, perhaps buying calls as a way to lock-in their right to buy the stock at $19 through mid-April 2011. Molycorp (MCP) is rallying for a second day. Shares jumped more than 9 percent yesterday. Today, MCP notched another 52-week high and is trading up $2.72 to $52.16 on news China has increased export quotas on rare earth materials. Meanwhile, in options action, 16,000 calls and 18,000 puts have traded in MCP. January 50, 55, 60 and 65 calls are seeing brisk trading. However, the January 50 put is the day's most active. While some investors appear to be buying short-term calls to play the stock's upward momentum, others are probably buying puts to hedge or protect recent gains. MCP is now up more than 80 percent so far in December. Bearish Career Education (CECO) is seeing a second day of bearish trading. As noted in yesterday's closing wrap, February 17 puts were busy Monday. Today, some investors might be adding to those positions. Another 2,575 traded and, like yesterday, the volume is trading predominantly at the ask (94 percent). With shares off 33 cents to $19.95, the flow over the past two days seems to reflect some concern about the short-term outlook for the for-profit education company. Earnings are expected around February 17 and possibly before the expiration. iShares MSCI Mexico Fund (EWW) loses a nickel to $61.22 and January puts are seeing some interest Tuesday morning. Jan 61s are the most actives. 14,940 traded. 73 percent traded at the ask, according to data from whatstrading.com website, and open interest is 623. So, it looks like buyers are opening new positions. Jan 60 puts are seeing interest as well. The overall action appears to be defensive or bearish trading on concerns about the short-term outlook for Mexico's equity markets. Unusual Volume Movers Pfizer (PFE) options volume is running 2.5X the usual, with 152,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 92 percent of the activity, according to data from website WhatsTrading.com. MannKind (MNKD) options activity is running 5X the usual, with 134,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 63 percent of the volume. Kraft (KFT) options volume is 15X the typical levels, with 130,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 99 percent of the activity. Increasing volume is also being seen in Rare Earth (REE), Deere (DE), and Nucor (NUE). Implied Volatility Movers Rare Earth (REE) is rallying along with peer Molycorp (see Bullish) and implied volatility is up for a second day. Shares have added $1.58 to $13.31 and options volume is 6X the average daily. 37,000 calls and 12,000 puts traded so far. Jan 10, 12.5, 14 and 15 calls are seeing brisk trading. Meanwhile, implied volatility is up 21 percent to 100 and has gained nearly 40 percent on the week.
12	1	a	Goldman Sachs has published a research report on Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) as the company exhibits cautious optimism going into 2Q11. In the report, Goldman writes Similar to the other steel producers that have reported this week, we believe that the bulk of price realization for Nucor will be delayed into 2Q from 1Q2011 and that 2H2011 will be a bit stronger than previously anticipated due to our higher steel price assumptions. Therefore, we are adjusting our 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q estimates for 2011 to $0.26, $0.76, $0.67, and $0.51 from $0.61, $0.68, $0.54, and $0.32. Our full-year 2011 estimate is now $2.20, up from $2.15. We are also raising our 2012 estimate to $3.75 from $3.50 on higher steel price assumptions, and introducing our 2013 EPS estimate of $4.25. Our higher 2011 estimates drive an increase in our six-month 2011E P/E- and EV/EBITDA-based target price to $42 from $40. Goldman Sachs maintains its Neutral rating and has raised the price target from $40 to $42. Nucor Corporation closed yesterday at $45.40.
13	0	a	The Department of Commerce has issued an affirmative preliminary circumvention ruling determining that Chinese imports of cut-to-length carbon steel (CTL) plate that include economically and metallurgically insignificant amounts of boron are subject to the antidumping duty order on CTL plate. Last year, Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and other domestic plate producers presented the Department of Commerce with compelling evidence that Chinese CTL plate with small amounts of boron added is being produced, marketed and sold to U.S. customers as a means to avoid paying antidumping duties. After completing its preliminary investigation, the Department of Commerce found that the boron-added CTL plate has virtually the same physical characteristics, uses and production process as CTL plate without boron. Therefore, Chinese CTL plate imports including minor amounts of boron will now be held subject to the antidumping duty order. Notably, the Department of Commerce's decision applies to all boron-added Chinese CTL plate imports – regardless of producer, exporter or importer. As a result of the ruling, The Department of Commerce has ordered Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to suspend liquidation of any Chinese boron-added plate imported since April 2010, when the investigation began. CBP will also require cash deposits of estimated duties on all Chinese boron-added plate. The current China-wide antidumping duty rate on plate is 128.59%. Commerce has also asked all interested parties to submit briefs on the subject within 20 days, before proceeding to a final determination. U.S. law authorizes The Department of Commerce to include products altered in minor respects within the scope of an antidumping duty order to prevent circumvention of that order. With respect to the antidumping duty order on Chinese CTL plate, the addition of only 0.0008% boron to the CTL plate converts carbon steel into an alloy steel under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, and so Chinese producers and importers have used this provision to trade and evade the antidumping order for many years. However, as the Commerce Department has now confirmed, the boron-added CTL plate, without special processing and heat treatment, has the same physical characteristics and uses as the subject CTL plate.
14	0	a	Thus far, this trading week has been full of reversals and divergences mainly emanating out of the materials and commodities sectors. Traders and investors seem to be unsure as to where the market should be and in what direction it should head. For example, after disappointing inventory data, natural gas futures plunged over 3% in the face of crude oil futures being up 2.5% and nearing 52-week highs. Major oil ETF, United States Oil fund (NYSE: USO) consequently closed near intraday highs at $42.60. As of late, rising oil prices have led to higher natural gas prices as investors look to alternative energy as a possible growth sector. Natural gas futures along with natural gas ETF, United States Natural Gas fund (NYSE: UNG), have come twenty percent off of their lows during crude oil's rapid spike from the mid ‘80s. Despite natural gas' morning freefall, shares of underlying natural gas companies diverged, showing no of signs of abating as their equity prices held firm. Shares of Apache Corp (NYSE: APA), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), Range Resources Corp (NYSE: RRC), and Nicor (NYSE: GAS) all showed signs of strength and mainly stayed in positive territory throughout the decline. That deviation may have been a sign of things to come as natural gas futures soared off of their lows and went from being down over 3% to being up over 1% – a four percent swing in two hours. The jump led to a subsequent, steady rise in underlying natural gas equity prices. UNG closed the day up 0.25% at $11.50; thirteen cents off of its intraday high. Apache closed positive 0.38% at $130.92. Range Resources was by far the strongest of the group putting in a 1.51% gain at $58.46. Nicor closed near the top of its daily range at $53.70. Devon Energy came into selling pressure at the end of the session; closing up marginally at $91.77. Another divergence came in the form of steel stocks taking a big hit in the early going while mining companies continued their climb following yesterday's strong intraday rebound. Right from the start of trading, shares of steel companies tumbled. US Steel (NYSE: X), Arcelor Mittal (NYSE: MT), AK Steel Corp (NYSE: AKS), and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) all put in big losses, showing little buying interest throughout the day. US Steel was the weakest of the group and closed down 4.21% at $53.94. The equity broke well below its 20- and 50-day moving averages after trading above them in the previous two sessions. AK Steel finished down 3.07% at $15.78. Arcelor took a 1.61% haircut, closing at $36.15. Nucor closed down 1.31% to $46.02, resting directly on top of its 20-day moving average. The mining companies fared much better as Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) put in gains of 0.56%, closing in the middle of the day's trading range at $55.55. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) was also strong, closing up 0.85% at $54.58. Shares of the company came under some selling pressure in the last thirty minutes of trading as copper futures moved from positive to negative territory. What do all these divergences and reversals mean? It means that traders, money managers, and investors have no idea where the market is going and are willing to let it churn until more concrete information becomes available. Perhaps tomorrow's jobs numbers will provide that catalyst for a decisive market move. Until then, it is a trader's playground.
15	1	a	Dahlman Rose & Co. is out with a research report on miners' earnings, and discusses Freeport McMoran (NYSE: FCX), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), Southern Copper (NYSE: SCCO) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) in the report. In a note to clients, Dahlman writes, Freeport McMoRan, Nucor, Steel Dynamics and Southern Copper released quarterly earnings results and BHP Billiton released its quarterly production report Nucor and Steel Dynamics handily beat our and the consensus earnings estimates as both companies benefited from high steel prices and improving demand and were able to partially offset higher raw material costs through their metals recycling businesses. Increased copper, gold and molybdenum production due to higher than anticipated ore grades at Grasberg and stronger demand in the molybdenum sector led to a substantial quarterly earnings beat for Freeport McMoRan. Southern Copper's earnings fell below our and the consensus estimates due to declining ore grades across a majority of the company's mines and a large increase in operating costs. In its production report, BHP Billiton showed strong iron ore production despite adverse weather conditions and planned maintenance work, but indicated that flooding in Queensland will affect met coal production for the remainder of the 2011 calendar year and that Gulf of Mexico permitting delays will lead to lower petroleum product production (ex-Fayetteville shale acquisition) in 2012.

18	1	a	One minute we hear that the politicians are close to a debt ceiling increase deal and then another minute we hear that they are not. The stock market only cares about certainty. This afternoon, we have seen small buy programs hit the stock market throughout the trading session only to find out it was simply a false rumor that caused the intra-day spike. This tells us that the stock market is just dying to pop higher on any debt ceiling deal announcement. Here is the problem, everyone is now waiting for a debt ceiling rally. Therefore, any debt ceiling rally that the markets get could simply be short lived. Remember the old stock market adage, when everyone expects the same thing rarely will it happen. Traders are some of the smartest people around. For example, most good experienced traders can tell when the markets are setting up to rally or break down. It still amazes me how traders do not run the world, it would be a much better place. Right now, traders are looking for a debt deal to get done, if they were not these markets would be tanking lower. So we should expect a deal of some sort to get done very soon. The big question that we must ask is, will the debt deal be a sell the news event? This is very possible after a short term rally or bounce. How many times do we see a stock surge higher after an earnings report or positive news only to come back down to earth in the next few trading days. This happens very often when everyone is expecting the good news. Right now, there are so many traders and investors expecting a debt ceiling increase that the move could be short lived. Just think about it, how could raising the debt ceiling be good for the economy? When is debt accumulation no longer a positive for the stock market? These will be the next set of questions that will be asked by traders and investors after this debt deal is settled. Traders should simply expect more volatility over the next few weeks. No one really knows how long a debt ceiling bounce will last. What we do know is, the more people that expect a massive rally to take place after the debt ceiling announcement the more crowded and short term that rally might be. Traders should also take note of the weakness in many of the leading steel stocks today. Stocks such as U.S. Steel Corp.(NYSE: X), AK Steel Holdings Corp.(NYSE: AKS), and Nucor Corp.(NYSE: NUE) are getting crushed today. This is not a good sign for a strong economic outlook. These stocks are not holding up at all compared to the major stock indexes. Don't expect the debt ceiling deal rally to last too long. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com
19	0	a	Morgan Stanley has upgraded Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) from Equal-weight to Overweight and has established a $51 price target.
20	0	a	As you may know, the major stock market indexes have been struggling since topping out in May 2011. Since that time, there has only been one way to get this market to trade higher; the U.S. Dollar Index has to decline. That's right, unless the U.S. Dollar Index sells off or declines the stock markets cannot seem to trade higher. In fact, when the U.S. Dollar Index strengthens everything deflates and trades lower. Several months ago when oil and commodity prices were soaring higher it was simply because the U.S. Dollar Index was weak and making new lows. Now that the U.S. Dollar Index has traded off the August lows by $4.00 the markets drop on any U.S. Dollar pop. Leading energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM), and Chevron Corp (NYSE: CVX) have rolled over as soon as the U.S. Dollar Index caught a bid. Today, leading commodity stocks such as Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF), Southern Copper Corp (NYSE: SCCO), and Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE) are all selling off sharply as the U.S. Dollar Index trades higher on the session. Traders can watch for intra-day resistance on the U.S. Dollar Index around the $78.52 level and more resistance around the $78.75 area. Remember, when the U.S. Dollar Index rallies the major stock indexes will decline. The only way this market trades higher is when the dollar dips. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com

22	0	a	CNBC Fast Money's Steve Grasso said on the show that it would be wise to buy the steel stocks, because they perform well in the month of December. Over the past four years AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) gained 13% on average in December, while United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) added approximately 20%. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), and ArcelorMittal (ADR) (NYSE: MT) jumped 11% on average in the same month. Steve Grasso added that for this trade to work, the market has to trade higher into year end, and you should hold these stocks no longer than 30 days. ArcelorMittal (ADR) (MT) spiked 8.81% on Monday, and United States Steel Corporation (X) gained 8.49%. Nucor Corporation (NUE) added 3.32%, while AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) traded 7.24% higher.
23	1	a	Sparrows Point in Baltimore County, Maryland, once housed the world's largest steel mill. However, times have changed, and just recently RG Steel announced that it would be laying off over 700 employees at its Sparrows Point plant. RG Steel, a private company, bought the plant last spring as part of a deal that cost the company $1.2 billion. GE Capital, a division of General Electric (NYSE: GE), loaned RG Steel $750 million to help complete the deal. The recent layoffs were precipitated by internal changes within GE Capital designed to boost the financial services company's reserves, which has had severe negative effects on RG Steel's liquidity. The news of the layoffs sent shock waves throughout the steel industry. No one is sure exactly how this will affect sheet supply in the U.S. in the near-term future. That said, the U.S. steel market has been suffering from excess sheet supplies for some time. Bank of America and others have noted that RG Steel's troubles could be a boon for other steel companies. Below are four companies that could benefit from the partial shut down of RG Steel's Sparrows Point plant, most of which were hit quite hard earlier in the year: 1. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) Market Cap: $910.87 million P/E: - AK Steel is a midwest-based company that produces electrical and stainless steels, including steel for automakers. The company's stock is down almost 50% year-to-date, but it appears that it may be poised for a rebound. Just recently, AK Steel announced a $50 per ton price increase for carbon steel products. However, if the company's stock does see a dramatic rise, this would hurt the shares' yields, which are currently attractive at 2.42%. 2. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) Market Cap: $3.81 billion P/E: - United States Steel is one of the world's top steel companies, and is capable of producing over 30 million net tons of raw steel annually. Like AK Steel, United States Steel is down over 50% year-to-date. That said, the company's stock has been on the rise over the last couple of months, a general trend in the steel market. Strong car sales would help the company. 3. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) Market Cap: $2.88 billion P/E: 11.68 Steel Dynamics is both a steel producer and metal recycler. The company announced its expected fourth quarter earnings this month, pegging earnings at $0.08 to $0.12 a share. That's higher than last year's fourth quarters earning, but lower than their third quarter 2011 earnings. The company also declared a $0.10 dividend per common share. The stock closed Friday at $13.15, and has a $20.70 52 week high. 4. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) Market Cap: $12.53 billion P/E: 20.01 Nucor Corporation produces steel and steel products, and is heavily involved in the manufacturing of sheet steel. The company shares are down only 9.7% year-to-date, which is a significantly stronger performance than the other companies in this list. While this is a positive, it suggests that the company may not have as much potential as a buy low “steal” as the other companies mentioned.

24	1	a	Credit Suisse maintains its Outperform rating on Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and raises its price target to $53 (previously $43) as sectors served by the company have shown signs of revitalization. Credit Suisse says, NUE has significant exposure to many facets of the U.S. economy, with autos comprising ~10% of total revenues and energy +10% for many of its products. Coupled with the expansion of NUE's SBQ capabilities announced yesterday, we believe investors should focus on the positive developments at Nucor in the coming years, including 1) cost improvements through the Louisiana DRI plant (still on-schedule for mid-2013 rampup), 2) margin expansion through the SBQ expansion, and 3) derisking, through the expansion of product offerings (Berkeley County) and increased customer diversification. NUE closed at $44.13 a share yesterday.

29	0	a	Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today that Nucor-Yamato Steel Company, a joint venture between Nucor and Yamato Kogyo Co. Ltd., has approved a $115 million plan to expand the production of hot rolled sheet piling. This project will be completed at Nucor's steel mill in Blytheville, Arkansas, and is expected to be completed in early 2014.
30	0	a	In a report published Friday, Credit Suisse Group reiterated its Outperform rating on Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), and raised its price target from $44.00 to $45.00. Credit Suisse noted, “While global macro uncertainty continues to pervade, we continue to view NUE as a relatively more defensive way to play a potential U.S. recovery over the next 3 years. The steep drop in scrap prices appears to have paused, with the next move in direction likely the most important indicator of where steel prices and NUE shares will move. However NUE continues to push forward on company specific catalysts, including 1) the recent Skyline acquisition (which we estimate to be accretive starting in 2013), 2) the completion of the DRI plant which is on target for 2013, and 3) the ongoing upgrades to existing mill capacity (SBQ capacity, Nucor Yamato expansion, completed vacuum degasser) aimed at increasing the value added product mix. We view Q3 guidance as conservative, and may prove to be the bottom for earnings given the company specific drivers which start to kick in 2H'13.” Nucor Corporation closed on Thursday at $38.23.
31	1	a	Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today that they have completed the sale of the assets of their Nucor Wire Products Pennsylvania facility located in New Salem, Pennsylvania, to an affiliate of Wire Mesh Corporation. We continually evaluate our businesses for long-term strategic fit and earnings potential. After careful evaluation of the wire mesh market and Nucor's role in that market, we made the decision to sell these particular assets. The Nucor Wire Products Pennsylvania teammates are a group of hard working and dedicated individuals. We greatly appreciate their efforts to produce high quality wire mesh, said James Darsey, Nucor's Executive Vice President of Bar Products.
32	0	a	In a report published Monday, J.P. Morgan & Co. reiterated its Overweight rating on Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), but slightly lowered its price target from $45.00 to $44.00. J.P. Morgan noted, “We rate shares of Nucor Overweight with a $44 December 2013 target price. Nucor has consistently grown throughout the steel cycle, emerging stronger and more diversified each time—we believe the current cycle is no different. Notably, plans to leverage traditional DRI technology will increase the company's raw material integration while helping reduce the associated volatility by leveraging low natural gas prices. In our view, Nucor's solid balance sheet, flexible cost structure, and continued focus on innovation and growth merit a premium valuation multiple.” Nucor Corporation closed on Friday at $40.75.

34	1	a	Billionaire investor George Soros, who as recently as late 2011 said gold was an asset bubble, now appears quite bullish on the yellow metal and the companies that extract it from the earth. During the third quarter, Soros Fund Management LLC added to its investment in the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the second-largest ETF in the world by assets. The firm raised its interest in GLD to 1.3 million shares from 884,400 shares, according to an SEC filing. Even at 1.3 million shares. Soros Fund Management owns a small percentage of GLD's shares outstanding, which stood at 443.2 million as of November 14. The filing also indicates Soros Fund Management has boosted its holdings of ETFs that own shares of gold miners. An August SEC filing showed the firm held 1 million shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and nearly 2.4 million shares of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). The November filing indicates Soros has more than doubled his GDX stake to 2.32 million shares and now holds a sizable chunk of call options on the ETF as well. The firm's position in GDXJ has not changed, according to the filing. Since mid-August, GLD has jumped 6.6 percent while GDXJ has soared 5.7 percent. GDX has risen 3.3 percent over the same time. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) combine for a third of GDX's weight. Soros also slightly added to his position in the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). The firm owned 350,000 shares of XME as of the August filing, but the more recent November filing indicates that stake has risen to 353,400 shares and the firm also owns call options on that ETF. XME does hold some gold miners, but the fund is heavily allocated to coal and steel names such as Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE). Soros also holds a stake in the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) as well as call options on that position. Other ETFs that Soros Fund Management holds interests in according to the November filing include the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP), the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE: KBE) and the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). The firm also owns options on the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM) and the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI). EEM is the second-largest emerging markets ETF by assets while FXI is the largest China fund. For more on ETFs, click here.
35	0	a	ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) today announced it expects to write down the goodwill in its European businesses by approximately US$4.3bn. This follows the completion of its yearly goodwill impairment test, as required by IFRS accounting standards. ArcelorMittal shares are down more than three percent at last check. The write down will take the form of a non-cash impairment charge that will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. The impairment is due to a weaker macro economic and market environment in Europe where apparent steel demand has fallen by approximately 8% this year, bringing the cumulative demand decline to approximately 29% since 2007. This weaker demand environment, and expectations that it will persist over the near and medium term, led to a downward revision of cash flow expectations underlying the valuation of the European businesses to which goodwill has been allocated. This is in contrast to the US, where apparent steel consumption is up almost 8% this year and is now approximately 10% lower than it was in 2007. Key metrics such as net debt and ebitda, as well as compliance with debt covenants, are unaffected by this impairment. Additionally, Fitch downgraded ArcelorMittal to BB+ with a Stable outlook. Elsewhere in the sector, AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) shares are down nearly four percent, shares of US Steel (NYSE: X) are down nearly three percent, and shares of Nucor (NYSE: NUE) are down almost two percent.
36	0	a	This weekend in Barron's online: a manufacturing boom in the United States is in its early days, part two of the Barron's 2013 Roundtable picks and pans, and the prospects for Intuitive Surgical, Apple and Ryman Hospitality Properties. Cover Story The Next Boom by Kopin Tan. After decades of outsourcing, the United States is quietly experiencing a manufacturing revival. Inexpensive natural gas and increasingly competitive labor costs are luring factories -- and jobs -- back to American soil. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and General Electric (NYSE: GE) are just a few of the companies making more of their goods at home again. And foreign companies are drawn here by the cheap energy, weak dollar and stagnant wages too. Samsung Electronics plans a semiconductor plant in Texas, Airbus SAS wants a factory in Alabama and Toyota (NYSE: TM) wants to export to Asia minivans made in Indiana. Barron's has identified eight stocks positioned to prosper in this manufacturing upswing, including Southwestern Energy (NYSE: SWN), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Calpine (NYSE: CPN), CF Industries (NYSE: CF) and Union Pacific (UNP). The effects of this boom may also boost regional lenders, home builders and local small businesses. Abundant gas and a weak dollar are long-term trends, says the article, and wages should behave until unemployment in the U.S. falls well below six percent. Offshoring went on for decades, but the reshoring trend is only getting started. Feature Stories The Barron's Roundtable offers additional investment bargains in energy, retailing, banking and more in It's Gonna Be Delicious by Lauren R. Rublin. This week's experts include Abby Joseph Cohen, Brian Rogers, Oscar Schafer and Scott Black. Robots in Search of Added Employment by Bill Alpert points out that Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ: ISRG) robots have revolutionized surgery for prostate cancer, as well as given the stock a pricey multiple. However, growth could get harder to find. In Rx for Apple: The 4% Solution, Andrew Bary suggests that now that Apple is no longer a high-growth company, it may be time for it to stop hoarding cash. A big share buyback might help the tech giant's faltering stock, but the strongest medicine would be a fatter dividend yield. Jonathan R. Laing's The Show's Just Gettin' Started at Ryman points out that Ryman Hospitality Properties (NYSE: RHP), owner of the Grand Ole Opry and other country-music assets, has become a REIT, with more than 90 percent of its revenue coming from four giant hotel resorts. Value manager Robert Sanborn of the Elkhorn Fund is profiled in Sarah Max's article Ready for the Reckoning. Sanborn says he is prepared for the worst, and shares why he is short Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and long PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP). Nailing the Answers in Our Contest by Andrew Bary features Michael Danaher, the handyman from the Chicago area who topped nearly 2,400 entrants to win the Barron's 2012 forecasting challenge. Jonathan Buck's The Watchwords in Davos: 'Structural Reform' says World Economic Forum attendees see the need for economic changes along with more stimulus programs. A possible United Kingdom pullout from the European Union is among the latest worries. In David Englander's Dole's Sweet Outlook, the stage could be set for a special dividend or share buybacks following a recent deal between Dole Food (NYSE: DOLE) and Japan's Itochu. The article says the future could be bright for Dole shareholders. The CEO spotlight is turned on Doug Yearley in The Master Builder by Leslie P. Norton. The former corporate litigator and home-improvement maven helped build Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL) into the nation's largest developer of luxury homes. In The Little Brokerage That Could by Vito J. Racanelli, McAdams Wright Ragen again turns in a stellar showing in the Barron's-Zacks semiannual stock-picking contest. The Seattle-based firm has only five analysts. Details Still to Come is an editorial commentary by Thomas G. Donlan in which he points out that the pace of innovation is uneven, but it is accelerating. Columns Columns in this weekend's Barron's discuss: The market as an investment guide Whether investor optimism has lifted the Dow Jones industrials too high Expectations that the new SEC head will get tough on Wall Street Whether Apple's glory days over Web services that put modern portfolio theory into practice for investors The unloved commodity ETFs Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and other dividend boosts Complaints about the pace of government downsizing

38	1	a	Is steel a steal? If prices for the metal really are at a near-term bottom, then now might be a good time to consider adding some cold, hard steel to your portfolio. Longbow Research showed an interest in the sector on Wednesday initiating coverage on four names in the steel space and upgraded another. If you’re into that sort of thing, there are plenty of articles that will take you through the fundamentals. Basically, if you’re looking for companies with a lot of debt, less than impressive margins and P/E’s so high that you scratch your head and ask why, you’re in the right place. But maybe these names look better from a technical perspective. Let’s see what the charts say about a few of the names that Longbow now has their eye on. First up is Nucor (NYSE: NUE). It’s one of Longbow’s favorites. They initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating. At the beginning of December, Nucor started an impressive move to the upside—nearly 20 percent. This caused a break out through the upper trend line of the ascending channel only to sell off modestly soon after. Then came a retest that formed a double top. The stock failed and sold off to the tune of 9 percent. The stock has since recovered, breaking through its 50 DMA on Wednesday. The stock looks ready to retest the $48.23 top. How about Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD)? If you bought this name back in June when it underperformed the S&P by as much as 25 percent, you’re feeling good about your stock picking abilities right now. It’s up 48 percent since its bottom and recently, a buying opportunity presented itself. Sell volume dried up causing the stock to shed 12 percent while still holding the lower trend line of the ascending channel. It’s currently testing the 20 DMA but the selloff might entice new buying interest if the broader market remains risk-off. Finally, the name that gets the most press in the steel space, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X). If you’re a volatility trader, look no further. Wild price moves aside, the name has only barely formed an ascending channel over the past six months—a red flag in a market that won’t do anything but keep rising. After a large gap higher at the beginning of the year, the stock plunged, breaking through its lower trend line in February. For now, this is a broken stock. U.S. Steel is below its 20, 50, and 200 moving averages and in a three month downtrend with sell volume showing no signs of drying up. Its next chance of gaining some momentum comes at the 200 DMA at $21.39 and then a test of the lower trend line right around $22.

44	0	a	In a report published Wednesday, BMO Capital Markets analyst Meredith Bandy initiated coverage on Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) with an Outperform rating and $54.00 price target. In the report, BMO Capital Markets noted, “BMO Research is initiating coverage of Nucor with an Outperform rating and US$54 target price. Nucor is arguably the 'best of breed' with the highest margins in the group and best balance sheet. Nucor also has best execution and benefits from growing low-cost DRI production. Not surprisingly, its valuation reflects its status with 2014E EV/EBITDA of 7.2x (6.1x for the group), P/E of 16.5x (14.3x for the group) and FCF Yield of 6.2% (8.0% for peers).” Nucor Corporation closed on Tuesday at $49.47.
45	1	a	In a report published Tuesday, UBS Investment Research analyst Matt Murphy reiterated a Buy rating on Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), and raised the price target from $50.00 to $56.00. In the report, UBS Investment Research noted, “Nucor has a sustained record of high margin and ROE generation, only one annual earnings loss in its history (2009), a healthy balance sheet, and over 40 years of uninterrupted quarterly cash dividends. Nucor invests with a long-term view which means investing consistently during downturns, thereby improving earnings power and leverage to recoveries. We believe Nucor's cost basis will improve with the startup of its second DRI facility and over the long-run from its investments in natural gas. While Nucor maintains a diversified product mix, roughly 65% of its end-demand is tied to construction which has yet to take off following the financial crisis. We rate Nucor a Buy and our $56 price target is based on a 7.5x EV/EBITDA (2015) multiple.” Nucor Corporation closed on Monday at $50.73.
46	1	a	In a report published Friday, Wells Fargo analyst Sam Dubinsky downgraded Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X). Wells Fargo downgraded US Steel from Market Perform to Underperform as the analyst noted, we believe shares are being rewarded prematurely on cost cutting measures. Nucor was downgraded from Outperform to Market Perform as the stock is valued appropiately. Dubinsky commented on how steel stocks have performed better due to a big uptick in spot HRC pricing which is currently close to $680 per ton and up. Pricing has recovered due to supply distribution as numerous mills had unexpected outages and raw material cost inflation. In addition, ASPs trended higher due to lean channel inventories and a pick-up in end demand. The analyst noted that mills are also taking a more aggressive stance on annual contract negotiations for 2014 following several years of offering discounts based on the CRU index. Wells Fargo is cautious on the steel sector as we believe mills are setting themselves up for weaker pricing in 2014 due to import competition. We note that while U.S. sheet pricing is currently up over $20+ per ton versus average quarter-to-date levels, international prices are flat to down as much as $15 per ton (weaker in Europe, more stable in Asia regions). We estimate the sheet import price spread using a basket of Geographies is at $165-215 per ton, which is the highest level we have seen since tracking the data (back to late 2010). The analyst estimates that sheet pricing could conservatively fall $30-$50 per ton. Wells Fargo valuation range for Nucor is between $50-$55 and $17-$21 for US Steel. Nucor and US Steel are both trading around -2.5% from yesterday's close.

50	0	a	Global crude steel production rose narrowly in February following a decline a month ago as gains across Asia, Europe and the Middle East capped declines in North and South America, according to a recent World Steel Association (“WSA”) report. The gain came on the heels of higher production in China – the world's biggest steel producer. The international trade body for the iron and steel industry noted that crude steel production for 65 reporting nations crept up 0.6% year over year in the reported month to 125 million tons (Mt). This compares favorably with a 0.4% fall in January. By regions, steel output moved up across Asia, European Union, Other Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania while falling in North America, South America and the C.I.S. Growth was seen across major Asian producers barring India, the fourth-largest producer. Output from China went up 0.4% year over year to 62.1 Mt in February following a 3.2% decline last month due to sluggish industrial activities ahead of new year holidays. Japan (the second largest producer) saw a 1.4% gain in output to 8.4 Mt. Production in India, however, slipped 3.2% to around 6.3 Mt. South Korea raked in a 6.2% gain to 5.3 Mt. Consolidated production went up 0.6% to 83.7 Mt in Asia. In North America, crude steel production in the U.S. – the third-largest steelmaker – dipped 1.7% to 6.7 Mt. Output in Canada and Mexico fell 9.3% and 1.5%, respectively, to around 1 Mt and 1.4 Mt, respectively. Overall production for the region was down 2.7% to roughly 9.1 Mt. In the Europe Union, production from Germany was up 4.2% to 3.6 Mt. Output rose 16.6% in the UK to 1 Mt while declining 3.9% to 1.2 Mt in France. Italy and Spain saw a 3.6% and 10.2% gain in production, respectively, to 2.2 Mt and 1.2 Mt, respectively. Production from Turkey went up 0.7% to 2.7 Mt. Total output rose 4.7% in the European Union to 13.9 Mt. Output in the Middle East rose 6.9% to 2.2 Mt with gains witnessed across Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Africa recorded a 7.7% gain to 1.2 Mt riding on a 19.3% rise in South Africa. Among other notable producers, production fell 3.1% in Russia to 5.3 Mt while rising 1.2% to 2.6 Mt in Brazil. Ukraine registered a 10.7% decline to 2.3 Mt. Crude steel capacity utilization ratio for the reporting countries was 77.6% in February, down from 79.6% a year ago. The ratio, however, improved from 74.4% in Jan 2014. Steelmakers globally suffered the pangs of challenging steel market fundamentals, European debt predicament and weak pricing for the most part of 2013. Steel prices were hobbled by overcapacity in the industry and weak demand, crimping margins of major producers including ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT), U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and AK Steel (NYSE: AKS). According to the WSA, world crude steel production rose 3.5% year over year to 1,607 Mt in 2013 as gains across Asia, Middle East and Africa more than offset declines in other regions. With the global economic recovery gathering steam and activities picking up in automotive and construction sectors, prospects look healthy for the steel industry in 2014. The WSA sees continued recovery in steel demand and expects global steel usage to increase 3.3% this year factoring in higher contributions from developed economies. Improving demand is also expected to perk up steel prices. A gradually healing economy, strength in the auto sector and a rebound in non-residential construction and housing markets are expected to help pull the U.S. steel industry out of its funk in 2014. Signs of stabilization in steel usage in the Euro zone also look encouraging after a bumpy 2013, which bode well for recovery prospects this year.

51	1	a	Steel giant Nucor Corporation's (NYSE: NUE) first-quarter 2014 adjusted earnings (excluding one-time items) of 41 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents per share. The adjusted earnings exclude charges of $12.8 million (or 4 cents a share) and $9 million (or 2 cents a share) associated with tax legislation changes in New York and asset disposal within the steel mills segment, respectively. Profit (as reported) came in at $111 million (or 35 cents per share), surging roughly 31% from $84.8 million (or 26 cents per share) posted in the prior-year quarter. First-quarter earnings results, when compared sequentially, were affected by severe weather conditions, leading to lesser demand, decrease in the availability of railcar and a weaker seasonal performance of the company's fabricated construction products businesses. Moreover, imports have adversely affected the company's pricing and margins at its bar and sheet mills. The Quarter in Detail Nucor, which is among the prominent steel producing companies along with ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) and United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X), registered revenues of $5,108.4 million in the quarter, up 12.3% from $4,550.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,819 million. Average sales price increased 3% compared with the year-ago quarter. Total tons shipped to outside customers rose 8% year over year to 6,189,000 tons in the reported quarter and total mill shipments increased 7% to 5,432,000 tons. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the first quarter was $398, up 5% from $379 a year ago. Overall operating rates at Nucor's steel mills were 75%, up 3% compared with the year-ago quarter. Increases in the natural gas and electricity unit costs led to increase the total steel mill energy costs in the first quarter by roughly $5 per ton compared to the first quarter of 2013. The progress of the new direct reduced iron (NYSE: DRI) plant in St. James Parish, LA, continued with 455,000 tons of production with peak operating rates outpacing 90% of the name plate capacity, thus achieving excellent metallization and carbon percentages. Verdict vs. Nucor in Texas Antitrust Case In Mar 2014, a Houston, TX-based jury returned a verdict against Nucor and five other co-defendants in an antitrust lawsuit filed in the Federal District Court in Houston, TX, by complainant MM Steel, LP, a steel plate service center. Per the verdict, all defendants jointly and severally are charged $52 million for damages caused. The amount is subjected to triple under the federal antitrust laws. The amount Nucor has to pay for the damages, if any, is unknown at this point. However, Nucor is pursuing every necessary post-trial motion and appeal to have the verdict overturned. Financial Position Nucor ended the first quarter with $1,252.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with $932.2 million in the year-ago quarter. It also has an unused $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that will mature in Aug 2018. Cash flow from operations was $149.2 million for first-quarter 2014, compared with $128.8 million recorded a year ago. Guidance Nucor expects better performance in the second quarter of 2014 compared with the first quarter (after excluding the impact of tax and disposal of assets expenses incurred). The company anticipates better performance from steel mills and fabricated construction product businesses (rebar fabrication, joist and decking and pre-engineered metal buildings) despite the expected continued pricing and margins pressure at the steel mills segment. Further, Nucor expects modest improvements in the nonresidential construction markets in 2014. Nucor currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Another player in the steel industry worth considering is Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (NYSE: SID), carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

52	0	a	Global crude steel production rose for a third straight month in April on higher output from China – the world's biggest steel producer – according to a World Steel Association (“WSA”) report. Gains in the European Union, thanks to a recovery in steel demand in the region, coupled with a strong rise in the Middle East also contributed to the growth. The international trade body for the iron and steel industry said that crude steel production for 65 reporting nations went up 1.7% year over year in the reported month to 137 million tons (Mt). This follows a 2.7% gain last month and a 0.6% rise in February. By regions, production data paints a mixed picture with Asia, European Union, North America and Middle East recording gains while Other Europe, South America, the C.I.S., Africa and Oceania registering a decline in output. All major Asian producers racked up gains barring Japan – the second largest producer. Output from China rose 2.1% year over year to 68.8 Mt in April. Japan saw a 2.5% fall in production to 8.9 Mt as a recent increase in sales tax by the government hurt demand in that country. Production in India, the fourth-largest producer, rose 5.3% to around 7 Mt. South Korea logged a healthy 10.8% gain to 6.1 Mt. Consolidated production rose 2.2% to 92.8 Mt in Asia. In North America, steel production in the U.S. – the third-largest steelmaker – edged down 1.6% to 7 Mt. Output in Canada and Mexico, however, rose 2% and 12.1%, respectively, to around 1 Mt and 1.6 Mt, respectively. Overall production for the region inched up 0.7% to roughly 9.7 Mt. In the Europe Union, production from Germany – the largest producer in the region – moved up 3.9% to 3.7 Mt. Output fell 4% in Italy to 2 Mt while climbing 16% to 1.4 Mt in France. Spain saw a 3.1% decline to 1.2 Mt. Production rose 13.5% in the UK to about 1.1 Mt. Total output rose 4% in the European Union to 14.6 Mt. Output in the Middle East climbed 9.6% to 2.3 Mt with gains witnessed across all steel producing countries. Africa recorded a 2.5% decline to 1.3 Mt with a 2.4% fall in South Africa. Among other notable producers, production from Turkey slipped 9.1% to 2.6 Mt. Russia, which is battered by its ongoing conflict with Ukraine, saw a mere 0.7% rise to 5.8 Mt while Ukraine registered a 4.5% decline to 2.6 Mt. Output from Brazil, the largest producer in South America, clipped 5.1% to 2.8 Mt. Crude steel capacity utilization ratio for the reporting countries was 78.7% in Apr 2014, down from 79.9% a year ago and 79% in the previous month. Steelmakers globally suffered the pangs of challenging steel market fundamentals, debt crisis in Europe and weak pricing for the most part of 2013. Overcapacity in the industry, a glut in cheaper imports and weak demand hammered steel prices during the year, hurting margins of major producers including ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT), U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and AK Steel (NYSE: AKS). According to the WSA, world crude steel production rose 3.5% year over year to 1,607 Mt in 2013 as gains across Asia, Middle East and Africa more than offset declines in other regions. China alone contributed nearly half of the global output. With the global economic recovery gathering steam and activities picking up in the construction sector, prospects look healthy for the steel industry in 2014. The WSA sees continued recovery in steel demand and expects global steel usage to increase 3.1% this year and further rise 3.3% in 2015. However, the industry faces challenges in form of an expected deceleration in steel usage in China and sluggishness in emerging economies due to certain structural issues. A gradually healing economy, strength in the auto sector and a rebound in non-residential construction and housing markets are expected to help pull the U.S. steel industry out of its funk in 2014. Moreover, an expected rise in steel usage in the Euro-zone looks encouraging after a lumpy 2013, which augur well for recovery prospects this year. Improving demand, driven by healthy momentum in the automotive market, is also expected to jack up steel prices. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

53	0	a	Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) expects higher profit on an year over year basis in second-quarter 2014 (ending Jul 5, 2014). But it sees earnings to come at the bottom end of its expectations that supported its qualitative guidance issued in April. The NC-based steel maker envisions earnings for the second quarter in the band of 35 cents to 40 cents per share, higher than 27 cents logged a year ago. The projected results are comparable with 35 cents recorded in first-quarter 2014. Nucor, in its first-quarter 2014 earnings call, said that it expects improved earnings on a sequential basis in the second quarter. Nucor's shares slipped roughly 2.2% last Friday to close at $50.52. For its Raw Materials division, Nucor expects an operating loss of $30 million or 6 cents per share at its new direct reduced iron (NYSE: DRI) plant in Louisiana due to high product yield losses. A planned three-week outage has been initiated at the plant this month to make some process adjustments to cut yield losses. The company sees meaningful improvement in the performance of the DRI facility in the third quarter and expects profitability in late 2014. The DRI facility, Nucor's largest project, came online in Dec 2013. The $750 million plant is expected to produce 2.5 million tons of DRI annually when the operations are in full swing. Nucor expects results at its Steel Mills segment to improve modestly on a sequential basis in the second quarter as improved profitability in sheet and plate more than offset reduced profitability in the structural steel business. A planned outage related to the sheet piling capital project is expected to lead to lower shipments for structural steel in the quarter. Moreover, higher imports continue to impact pricing and margins. Following a weaker seasonal performance in the first quarter, Nucor's fabricated construction products businesses returned to profitability in the second quarter, helped by improving conditions in the non-residential construction market. The company sees higher operating profits from these businesses moving ahead. Nucor is seeing strength across end markets such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and general manufacturing. Demand across these end-markets is healthy, lending support to the company's top line. However, Nucor remains exposed to weak pricing and challenging steel market fundamentals. The company, like other steel makers, is hobbled by surging domestic steel imports. Nucor currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some other stocks worth considering in the steel space include Universal Stainless & Alloy Products Inc. (NASDAQ: USAP), Grupo Simec S.A.B. de C.V.(AMEX:SIM) and ThyssenKrupp AG (TYEKF). While Universal Stainless holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Grupo Simec and ThyssenKrupp carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

54	1	a	Steel giant Nucor Corporation's (NYSE: NUE) second-quarter 2014 profit came in at $147 million (or 46 cents per share), surging roughly 73% from $85.1 million (or 27 cents per share) posted in the prior-year quarter. Earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. The improved second-quarter earnings results, when compared sequentially, were driven by improved performance by the steel mills segment, particularly at the sheet and bar mills. The Quarter in Detail Nucor registered revenues of $5,291 million in the quarter, up 13.4% from $4,665.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,181 million. The company's sheet steel and bar mills profitability increased due to higher sales volumes and margin improvement. However, structural steel experienced decreased volumes as Nucor-Yamato Steel underwent a planned three week outage in the second quarter. Nucor's fabricated construction products businesses returned to solid profitability in the quarter, due to improving conditions in the nonresidential construction markets. Results from the raw materials segment decreased in the second quarter compared with the sequentially prior quarter as the company's new direct reduced iron (NYSE: DRI) plant in St. James Parish, LA, underwent a three week outage to implement adjustments that is expected to improve yield and conversion costs. However, the plant produced outstanding quality DRI units and also exceeded the company's volume expectations. Lower scrap selling prices also led to decreased profitability in the raw materials segment when compared with the sequentially prior quarter. Average sales price per ton increased 4% from the year-ago quarter. Total tons shipped to outside customers rose 9% year over year to 6,370,000 tons in the reported quarter and total mill shipments increased 9% to 5,477,000 tons. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the second quarter was $384, up 2% from $377 a year ago. Overall operating rates at Nucor's steel mills were 79%, up from 73% in the year-ago quarter. Total steel mill energy costs in the reported quarter increased by $1 per ton year over year. Financial Position Nucor ended the second quarter with $1,167.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with $678.12 million in the year-ago quarter. Long-term debt was $4,368.9 million at the end of the quarter versus $3,380.2 million a year ago. It also has an unused $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that will mature in Aug 2018. Guidance Nucor expects strong earnings improvement in the third quarter of 2014. The company stated that non-residential construction market is improving at a modest pace, despite being historically low levels. The company anticipates further increased operating profits in its downstream products businesses. In the third quarter, steel mill profitability is also expected to improve as Nucor-Yamato Steel division has no planned outage and sheet and plate margins continue to benefit from positive pricing trends. Further, Nucor forecasts Louisiana DRI facility to demonstrate improvement in the performance in the third quarter with profitable performance anticipated by the end of the year. Nucor currently retains a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some other stocks worth considering in the steel and related industries include NN Inc. (NASDAQ: NNBR), Olympic Steel Inc. (NASDAQ: ZEUS) and ThyssenKrupp AG (TYEKF). While NN holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Olympic Steel and ThyssenKruppretain a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

55	0	a	Seaborne iron, a main ingredient in steel, prices are projected to increase by about 10 percent in 2014, according to Diana Shipping's most recent earnings call. China is the largest steel producer, contributing nearly 50 percent of total steel production in Q1 of 2014, according to the World Steel Association. In a Morgan Stanley note covering China steel, analyst Rachel Zhang predicts steel production to be near its peak from its recent highs, including a 3.59 percent increase in August. Zhang expects that production will not increase materially in the near future. On Monday, artillery fire in Ukraine influenced steel producer Metinvest to discontinue production at three more of its plants. With nearly 15,000 employees, Metinvest is a large employer in Ukraine, and that will negatively impact its economy for the time being. Market Vectors Steel (ETF) (NYSEARCA:SLX) up 1.46 percent United States Steel (NYSE: X) up 5 percent AK Steel Holding (NYSE: AKS) up 6.78 percent ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE: MT) up 2.25 percent Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) up 3 percent Schnitzer Steel Industries (NASDAQ: SCHN) up 1.14 percent Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) up 2.77 percent Commercial Metals (NYSE: CMC) up 2 percent
56	1	a	Shares of Schnitzer Steel (NASDAQ: SCHN) are trading higher following a better than expected outlook this morning. The company now sees fourth quarter EPS in the $0.28-0.32 range vs a previous expectation of $0.20. The company points to higher profitability in recycling and manufacturing, as well as cost reduction initiatives, as the catalysts behind the better outlook. The company reports earnings on October 28. SCHN is up 5.5 percent at 24.04. Shares of other steel makers aren't faring as well this morning, with US Steel (NYSE: X) down 2 percent at 39.80. Nucor (NYSE: NUE) is also lower, down 0.13 percent at 54.48.
57	0	a	Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (NYSE: CLF) may be getting close to obtaining partners for a troubled Bloom Lake iron mine in Quebec. Chief Executive Lourenco C. Goncalves told investors earlier this week the company is in active discussions with three unnamed potential partners that would help with the roughly $1.95 billion required to double operations there and restart its profits. Bloomberg reported Friday that Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE) and two Japanese steel companies it didn't name are the potential partners. Cliffs jumped 8 percent in afternoon trading Friday, trading recently at $11.38 a share. Goncalves said that together with existing partner Wuhan Iron Ore & Steel Co., the four minority equity holders would absorb the entire production of the Bloom Lake mine. We have a goal of securing commitments before the end of 2014, Gonclaves said, adding that without the equity infusion, Cliffs would close the operation. With the cash infusion in place, Goncalves said the mine would produce 13.5 million tons of high quality iron ore at a relatively low cost. This would be truly outstanding. And with this cost profile and equity fusion, we would surely want to continue to want and operate that, Goncalves said. The company continues with plans to sell iron mines in Australia along with its Applachia coal mines and focus on five iron mines in Michigan and Minnesota. Cliffs announced a $6 billion write-down Oct. 17 for the impairment of assets that included the Bloom Lake mine.
58	0	a	Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio. One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Olympic Steel Inc. (NASDAQ: ZEUS), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in ZEUS. A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 3 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.09 a share a month ago to its current level of 73 cents. Also, for the current quarter, Olympic Steel has seen 2 downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 2 cents a share from 20 cents over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 10.1% in the past month. So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait. If you are still interested in the Steel-Producers sector, you may instead consider some better-ranked stocks including Kobe Steel Ltd. (KBSTY), Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X). All these stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and may be better selections at this time.

In the report, Nomura noted, “We continue to see NUE's earnings mix in the coming years benefitting from accelerating non-res construction markets, a higher contribution of value added products, and raw materials cost (DRI) tailwinds. While Nucor's 1Q-15 guidance of only marginal improvement vs. 1Q-14 implies significant q/q downside, management expects lower scrap values set to materialize in February (market expects a $30-40/ton m/m decline) to result in meaningful metal margin relief starting 2Q- 15. The Louisiana DRI plant won't be operational until late in 1Q-15, resulting in similar losses as 4Q ($35mm) this quarter. After incurring losses of $135mm in 2014, NUE expects the operation to improve through the year, becoming profitable by year-end. We estimate that, at $65/t iron ore and $3.00/mmBtu gas prices, DRI would drive ~$0.60 of EPS at current pig iron prices.” Nucor Corporation closed on Wednesday at $44.04.
61	0	a	Analysts at Deutsche Bank recently updated their outlook on the steel industry now that most steel companies have released their 4Q14 earnings reports. Deutsche Bank lowered their average price targets by 12 percent due to plunging steel spot prices, but reiterated their Buy ratings for three big names in the space. Forecast Analysts lowered their projected Hot Rolled Coil (HRC) forecast from $600 per short ton to $575. In addition, After incorporating the latest steel prices and the updated Q4 earnings numbers Deutsche Bank reduced its 2015 EBITDA predictions by about 11 percent. Downside risk U.S. HRC prices have dropped by 21 percent in the past six months, falling to as low as $543 per short ton. Analysts believe that the industry is near an inflection point, and they list four reasons for their hopefulness: 1. Supply-side response 2. Contraction of import arbitrage 3. Seasonal increase in demand 4. Increased protectionism Deutsche Bank stress tested its model for a full-year HRC price of $550 per short ton ($25 below its forecast) and found that the average downside in expected EBITDA for the companies it covers is about 19 percent. Steel demand expected to remain strong Steel demand will likely remain high in 2015 from both the automotive industry and the construction industry. While falling oil prices have collapsed steel demand in the energy sector (about 10 percent of the total steel demand), low oil prices have stimulated steel demand in other segments of the economy. Stock picks Even with the 19 percent downside earnings risk related to low steel prices, Deutsche Bank analysts believe the beaten-down stocks in the space offer a compelling risk/reward balance at current prices. Deutsche Bank lowered price targets but reiterated their Buy ratings on AK Steel Holding Corp (NYSE: AKS), Steel Dynamics Inc (NASDAQ: STLD) and United States Steel Corp (NYSE: X). Deutsce Bank has a Hold rating on Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE).
62	0	a	On CNBC's Stock Pops & Drops, Brian Kelly said that China Mobile Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE: CHL) is a bet on China and since China is slowing he doesn't want to buy the stock. China Mobile dropped 4.23 percent and Kelly doesn't see a buying opportunity. He would stay away from the stock. Jon Najarian explained that Guess?, Inc. (NYSE: GES) traded 16.01 percent higher because Old Navy was off the charts. He added that a big short interest had some impact, too. Karen Finerman sees more room on the downside in Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (NYSE: CFR). She wouldn't buy the stock. Guy Adami thinks that Nucor Corporation's (NYSE: NUE) guidance was a disaster. The stock fell 6.43 percent to $46.10 and it seems to Adami that it is going to $42.
63	0	a	U.S. steel producers are likely to file dumping charges against China following the release of their first-quarter results, an analyst said Monday. But it's often a regulatory 'whack-a-mole' game, Clarkson Capital's Lee McMillan said. Cheap steel is notoriously difficult to keep out of the country. Despite his expectation of continued low steel prices, McMillan launched coverage on eight steel makers Monday with no less than four Buy ratings. Key to picking winners: exposure to the U.S. automotive and construction industries. Citing those factors, McMillan offered Buy recommendations on ArcelorMittal SA (NYSE: MT), AK Steel Holding Corp. (NYSE: AKS) Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE) and Tata Steel Ltd. Steel makers that rely on the oil and gas industry, which typically accounts for 10 percent of U.S. steel demand, are likely to be in a rut for awhile, McMillan said. Rating a Sell: United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X) for its high fixed costs and reliance on the U.S. energy sector. McMillan is on the fence mostly over valuation with Hold ratings on Commercial Metals Co. (NYSE: CMC), Reliance Steel & Aluminum (NYSE: RS) and Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD). With Chinese Steel consumption down more than 7 percent in the first two months of 2015, McMillan said imports will continue to depress U.S. steel prices. China produces about half the world's steel and consumes about 48 percent. Much of its remainder ends up on the U.S. market.

66	0	a	Oppenheimer technical analyst Ari Wald’s new report out this week highlight’s the firm’s 10 “Worst of the Worst” stocks to sell on technical weakness. Here’s a breakdown of the 10 names included in the report. 1. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) Support that had been holding for ConocoPhillips throughout 2015 recently broke down, leaving more room to the downside for the stock. 2. CONSOL Energy Inc (NYSE: CNX) After CONSOL recently broke below a support level dating back to early 2012, the bottom fell out of the stock. CONSOL is now trading at 10-year lows. 3. Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE) Nucor is currently in danger of breaking below a support level that held for the stock earlier this year. A breakdown below that level would leave much more room for downside. 4. Owens-Illinois Inc (NYSE: OI) After forming a series of lower highs throughout 2015, Owens-Illinois is now in the process of establishing a new 2015 low. 5. Fluor Corp (NYSE: FLR) After a bounce earlier in the year, Fluor’s stock now finds itself trading at multi-year lows. 6. Emerson Electric Co (NYSE: EMR) Emerson is another stock that bounced earlier this year, but it’s now once again headed south. 7. EMC Corp (NYSE: EMC) EMC broke below its ascending support line early in 2015, and it appears that the line is now serving as resistance for the stock. 8. Teradata Corp (NYSE: TDC) When Teradata’s lateral support line and descending resistance line pinched the stock into a corner, the stock eventually broke out to the downside. 9. Coach Inc (NYSE: COH) Hopes that the double bottom established in 2014 would once again hold as support for Coach were recently dashed, and the stock is now trading at five-year lows. 10. NRG Energy Inc (NYSE: NRG) As was the case with Teradata, when NRG’s resistance line and support line converged, resistance won out, and the stock broke down to new multi-year lows.

68	0	a	Luke Folta of Jefferies stated in a note that headwinds facing the steel sector is stronger now than at any other time since the 2009 global downturn. Reduction in metal pricing and a lower than previously expected overall demand resulted in a 12 percent reduction to earnings forecasts and corresponding price target objectives. Companies with the highest/most defensible margins can still offer investors good value. In a report published Wednesday, Jefferies analyst Luke Folta revised his steel estimates lower, reflecting weaker U.S. demand trends and a darkened outlook for global steel prices due to a slowing Chinese demand and strong U.S. dollar. Folta's bearish stance stems from his third quarter steel survey which suggested steel demand continues to trend lower versus expectations and a recovery in steel prices is unlikely to occur in 2015. The analyst added that diminished demand is also attributed to a severe pullback in oil and gas along with incremental weakness in key industries including mining and agriculture. Folta said 52 percent of industry contacts he surveyed reported a weaker steel demand quarter over quarter while 39 percent anticipate a seasonally weaker fourth quarter. Meanwhile, prices for HRC (hot-rolled coil) saw renewed weakness to $450/t as of mid-September, although recent deals were reportedly as low as $420/t with 29 percent of contacts are expecting further incremental weakness. As such, the analyst revised his 2015 HRC price target lower by $27/t to $464 and slashed his 2016 estimates by $47/t to $476. Related Link: This Part Of Alcoa's Business Is Flying Under The Radar Value Still To Be Found In Stocks Folta stated that it has been his core thesis for some time to favor steel companies that lead the industry in terms of : 1) margins and free cash flow generation, 2) favorable low/variable cost structure, 3) high value product offering and lack of outsized cash requirements (i.e pension, capex, etc), 4) ability to enable growth through investments. In addition, companies with above average exposure to the U.S. non-residential construction market is also a favorable attribute. The analyst added that Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE: RS), Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) are companies that satisfy his criteria and offer good value. Price Target And Ratings Shares of A.M. Castle & Co (NYSE: CAS) are Hold rated with a $2.50 price target. Shares of AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE AKS) are Hold rated with a $3 price target. Shares of Commercial Metals Co. are Buy rated with a $20 price target. Shares of Nucor are Buy rated with a $52 price target. Shares of Olympic Steel, Inc.

69	0	a	Shares of non-precious metals miners have continued slumping this year as highlighted by the performances of exchange-traded funds dedicated to coal producers and steelmakers. However, the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME) has recently been perking up, rising more than 2 percent over the past month. That might not sound like much, but consider this: The $259 million XME is down 40.5 percent this year and more than 47 percent over the past year. XME Headwinds Slack global economic growth forecasts and flooding of the market with cheap steel by foreign producers are among the headwinds XME and its 30 holdings have had to deal with in recent years. Slumping steelmakers are a significant problem for XME, as the ETF devotes 48 percent of its weight to that group. That makes steel producers XME's larges industry weight at nearly quadruple the weight assigned to diversified miners, the ETF's second-largest sector exposure. Related Link: Bullish Leveraged Gold Miners ETFs Are On Fire “An appreciating U.S. dollar, excess global capacity due to weaker demand in China and the influx of cheap imports has negatively impacted U.S. domestic steel producers’ market share and margins due to the extreme price competition,” said S&P Capital IQ in a note out Monday. “However, S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Matthew Miller believes the worst is over for steel producers and we see upcoming catalysts from pending trade case determinations. He thinks that imports will revert back down to historical levels, allowing steel producers to benefit from a gradually improving construction market, impressive automobile demand, and an aerospace industry poised to experience a long-term secular uptrend.” XME Allocations XME features four steelmakers among its top 10 holdings, including Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), which accounts for 4.4 percent of the ETF's weight. S&P Capital IQ has a Strong Buy rating on Nucor, the largest U.S. steelmaker. “According to Miller, NUE's strategy to become more vertically integrated with its new Louisiana direct reduced iron plant will result in generally less volatile production costs. The new plant will enhance NUE's low-cost position in the U.S. steel industry. “For the longer term, he sees earnings rising on U.S. economic growth, strong automotive demand, and a recovery in U.S. nonresidential steel demand and better control of raw material costs. In 2016, S&P Capital IQ forecasts $3.18 in 2016, up from $1.67 in 2015, driven in part by 8 percent revenue growth,” said the research firm. XME's Catalysts XME has also recently been boosted by the resurgence of precious metals miners, as the ETF allocates a combined 23.2 percent of its weight to precious metals miners. Up nearly 13 percent over the past month, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is among the leaders of the precious metal miners ETF comeback. “GDX has $5 billion in assets and it trades on average 63 million shares on a daily basis with a $0.01 bid/ask spread,” said S&P Capital IQ. GDX is top heavy, as its top 10 holdings combine for over half the ETF's weight. Image Credit: Public Domain
70	0	a	Timna Tanners of Bank of America is expecting 2016 benchmark US hot rolled coil (HRC) to average $455/short ton, marking an increase from current spot prices of around $375 to $390 per ton. Tanners suggested that minimills will prove to be the more attractive investment option. The analyst added that United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) could only see a near-term boost from trade case and mill price hike headlines. US hot rolled coil (HRC) are currently selling for $375 to $390 per ton on the spot market. According to Timna Tanners of Bank of America, HRC prices are expected to increase to an average of $455/short ton in 2016, marking a more modest rebound than previously thought. Tanners previously projected HRC prices would rise to $475/t in 2016. Her revised focus was attributed to a lower base than previously expected given the recent market implosion. The analyst added that her China steel team is now forecasting a decline of 1.2 percent in global demand growth through 2016, but net exports will remain high at 91 million mt versus 96 million mt expected in 2015. Minimills To Take Share, Nucor A ‘Wildcard' According to Tanners, minimills will increasingly be the more attractive investment option heading into 2016 as the integrateds (such as US Steel and AK Steel) will only see a near-term boost from trad case and mill price hike headlines. However, the price hikes may prove to be insufficient to enable the integrateds to return to profitability. Tanners added that both US Steel and AK Steel face lower annual contract pricing on 25-33 percent of shipments next year. In addition to that, US Steel will likely face liquidity issues in 2017 given a $450 million maturity mid 2017 and another $500 million maturity in early 2018. Tanners also noted that Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) is the wild card heading into 2016 as it is uncertain if it will use the projected $2.2 billion in free cash flow it will generate in 2015 for any accretive activity. Ratings And Price Targets Shares of AK Steel remain Underperform rated with an unchanged $1 price target. Shares of Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) remain Neutral rated with an unchanged $17 price target. Shares of Nucor remain Buy rated with an unchanged $52 price target. Shares of Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) remain Buy rated with an unchanged $23 price target. Shares of US Steel remain Underperform rated with a price target lowered to $3 from a previous $7.

73	0	a	KeyBanc Capital Markets’ Philip Gibbs downgraded the rating for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) from Overweight to Sector Weight, while removing the price target. He expressed concern regarding the company's lackluster 1Q outlook, higher scrap costs, weaker plate/bar pricing, and higher corporate SG&A. Nucor projected FIFO profitability in 1Q to be somewhat similar q/q, implying 1Q FIFO EBITDA guidance of ~$251M and $237.4M on a LIFO basis, analyst Philip Gibbs said. He added, “If taken literally to mean flattish, this is ~40% below the Street's LIFO of $400M and 34% below our prior $362M.” The 1Q EBITDA estimate has been reduced from $362M to $325M to reflect higher scrap input costs. Although Nucor’s guidance has historically been conservative, this time it appears significantly short of expectations, Gibbs commented. The LIFO EBITDA estimate for FY16 has been reduced from $1.9B to $1.6B, versus the Street's $1.9B. The reduction reflects a more lackluster 1Q baseline and higher scrap cost assumptions. The LIFO EPS estimates for 1Q and 2016 have been reduced from $0.27 to $0.20 and from $1.89 to $1.25, respectively. “NUE noted in its 10-K that despite macro headwinds, it sees 2016 to be on par with 2015 from a sales and profit perspective (ex-LIFO), implying LIFO EBITDA around $1.3B (>30% below the Street). We see this as conservative, likely embedding weaker Steel volumes vs. our +5% YOY view and a mark-to-market of scrap inputs (and perhaps some potential modest inflation),” Gibbs wrote. The analyst believes that solid FCFE, dividend yield support, and long-term opportunities for market share gains would offer downside protection to Nucor’s shares.
74	1	a	In a new report, JPMorgan analyst Michael Gambardella takes a look at the shrinking U.S. price premium on steel versus China. According to the report, the hot-rolled coil (HRC) spread has dipped to only $54/ton, its lowest level in three years. “The main drivers of the narrowing are higher Chinese steel prices, which reflect a pickup in demand and lower supply with low steel output and inventors levels,” Gambardella explains. Related Link: IEA: The Next Oil Price Shock Could Be To The Upside The U.S./China HRC spread was as high as $233/ton as recently as 2014. Chinese steel prices have spiked 33 percent in the past week from $300/mt to $400/mt. A pickup in Chinese steel demand and improving sentiment are the primary reasons for the spike. In the U.S., JPMorgan expects that steel prices will continue to climb throughout 2016 due to domestic supply cuts and reductions in imports. Gambardella notes that, since China accounts for about half of global steel production, rising Chinese prices are certainly a boost for U.S. producers. However, he adds that high Chinese prices are not a critical part of the bull thesis for U.S. producers. JPMorgan names United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) as its top steel stock picks. Disclosure: the author holds no position in the stocks mentioned.

BZ News Desk Focus 51.9 percent of voters, or 17.41 million people, in the United Kingdom said they no longer wish their country to remain a member of the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron campaigned for the stay vote and announced he will step down from office immediately following the vote. Former London mayor Boris Johnson was a big supporter of the leave campaign and his name is being thrown around as a potential successor to Cameron. UK-based banks were among the largest decliners, followed by other European banks, followed by U.S.-based banks. For the most part, U.S.-based banks were trading lower by a single-digit percentage. Granted, this is still a notable selloff but compared to its European counterparts, investors are less concerned over how a Brexit will impact business.

78	0	a	United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) reported its second-quarter results after Tuesday's market close, which proved to be better than expected. United States Steel wasn't alone in reporting a better-than-expected earnings report, and many of its peers also surprised to the upside. Benzinga reached out to Axiom's Gordon Johnson to discuss what is going on in the steel sector. Gordon Johnson On Steel According to Johnson, steel investors shouldn't hold on to an optimistic view moving forward. The analyst stated that the second quarter of a calendar year typically marks peak optimism in the steel space. Related Link: Credit Suisse Sees 26% Upside In U.S. Steel Meanwhile, auto demand (a key sector client of most steel clients) is weakening, imports are on the rise, oil prices are moving lower and there will be an impact from the Brexit vote — no matter how small. Johnson added that the market is ignoring all of these industry headwinds and it won't last forever. The analyst also suggested that the dividends offered by steel companies are not safe for the foreseeable future. Many steel companies are highly leveraged and operate with high fixed costs associated with plant maintenance. Finally, Johnson doesn't see any new regulation that could support steel prices. He stated that imported steel into the United States is now seen as on par with U.S. produced steel to the point where it is hard for steel mills not to buy imports. The US mills have went too far, and now there will be a flood of imports in 2H16 pushing steel prices lower yet again, the analyst concluded. Steel is a commodity, and the US is not the price setter. It is the price taker. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

79	0	a	Citi’s Alexander Hacking noted Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) has “consistently generated industry leading ROIC over the business cycle while growing production capacity and adding more value added product offerings.” Hacking initiated coverage of the company with a Neutral rating and price target of $55. The Positives Due to its consistent above average ROIC, the company has traded at a premium to the rest of the industry. “NUE is the North American market leader in nearly every long steel product and many fabricated products, and also the third largest producer of sheet steel,” the analyst mentioned. Hacking also pointed out that Nucor is the only steel producer in North America with an investment grade rating of (A-), as well as sufficient cash and liquidity to continue to invest in improving its earnings power, which is the company’s top capital allocation priority. Related Link: Steel Dynamics Has 33% Upside, According To Citi ROIC However, since ROIC, the company’s ROIC gas averaged only 5.3 percent, driven by declining operating margins and meaningful investments in the raw material segment that are yet to pay off. “We expect some improvement in the Raw Materials segment but it will likely still under earing its cost of capital over the next several years,” Hacking stated. Dividend In addition, Nucor has a solid history of growing dividends, which has supported the shares. However, with payout ratios of more than 80 percent, the analyst believes there is little room for any significant increases in the medium term. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

80	0	a	It’s critical to know whether a stock you plan on buying has an ex-dividend status, because in case it does, the dividend would be paid out to the seller. The person who owns the stock on the ex-dividend date will be awarded the payment, which means that you’ll have to wait for the next dividend cycle to receive your first dividend payout from the company. On the other hand, share prices typically decline just after the ex-dividend date is declared, and usually by an amount equal to the expected dividend. So, this may give you the opportunity to identify a good entry point. If you’re planning on selling shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you'll receive the dividend payout from the company. Here is the list of stocks going ex-dividend on Wednesday.

82	1	a	Argus said in a note on Friday that it expects Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) to benefit from the Trump administration's plans to boost infrastructure spending as well as further actions to limit the dumping of imported steel. Election Result, Housing Market: Twin Catalysts Analyst David Coleman noted that the shares of Nucor, which declined in late October in reaction to its disappointing third quarter results, have rallied along with other steel stocks since the November 8 election. Additionally, the analyst sees the company benefiting from the strength in the U.S. housing market. Argus believes the company can counter the potential fourth-quarter weakness stemming from lower margins in the steel mills segment by the strength in the U.S. housing market, which accounts for 65 percent of the company's revenues. The company also expects a loss in its raw materials segment due to lower transfer prices at direct-reduced iron facilities, the firm noted. Accordingly, the company predicted a sequential decline in fourth-quarter earnings. Argus estimates earnings of $2.39 per share for 2016 and $2.99 per share for 2017. Maintaining Rating, Upping Price Target Argus maintains its Buy rating on the shares of the company, while it upped its price target to $65 from $58. The firm continues to view the company as a best-in-class steel manufacturer. At last check, Nucor was down 0.59 percent at $59.10.

86	1	a	Despite being struck with a major defeat in healthcare, President Donald Trump remains dedicated toward overseeing a major infrastructure initiative as soon as this year. As such, investors are looking to capitalize on companies that will benefit from what could be an injection of $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over the coming decade. CNBC's Jim Cramer offered two stocks for investors to consider during Friday's Squawk on the Street segment. Marin Marietta Materials And Nucor Shares of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) were trading higher by more than 3 percent on Friday, likely as a result of Cramer naming the supplier of crushed stone, sand, and gravel as a suitable infrastructure play. Cramer's other pick, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) was trading lower by around 0.50 percent on Friday. Cramer explained that Martin Marietta is an obvious materials & aggregate play, and many infrastructure projects would need to use the company's products. Although not similar to Marin Marietta, Cramer emphasized the fact that Nucor invested billions of dollars in its business over the years which makes it a very in-expensive stock to own. Cramer also recommended investors remain cautious on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) after the company was subject to an accounting investigation. Also, the stock is heavily shorted although at the end of the day Caterpillar remains a great American company and has strong prospects in China.

88	0	a	Recent History of Steel Stocks The U.S. steel industry has been in a downtrend since the 2008 global recession due, in large part, to China's dumping of cheap steal into the market. The chart below illustrates just how much the imbalance of China's imports and exports of steel has widened since 2009. Source: Steel Industry Executive Summary: May 2017 This supply and demand imbalance has pushed steel prices lower which has weighed heavily on producers such as U.S. Steel Corp (NYSE:X), Nucor (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD). However, sentiment for this sluggish industry changed following the election of President Donald Trump and his “America First” focus. What Makes Steel Stocks Shine Now? Just last month, President Trump ordered a probe of foreign steel’s impact on U.S. security. The potential outcomes of this Section 232 investigation could be additional tariffs and (or) limiting imports of foreign made steel. This could help inflate U.S. steel prices which would ultimately help U.S. steel manufactures. Global demand also appears to be on the uptrend. The World Steel Association reported in April that the global steel capacity utilization is up by 26%, its highest level in nearly two and half years. More recently on May 24th, Credit Suisse upgraded the entire steel sector highlighting that its channel checks with U.S. traders and OEMs indicate that a structural change is taking place with respect to U.S. trade… which the market is underestimating. Tailwinds appear to be building in the U.S. steel market. Why Nucor? Nucor Corporation is an American steel and related products producer. It is the largest steel producer in the U.S. and also the largest minimill steelmaker. The use of minimills in steel manufacturing rather than traditional methods of melting the scrap steel adds more value to Nucor when compared with traditional manufacturers such as U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel (NYSE:AKS). Minimills are already experiencing a comeback and have been a bright spot in the industry. Bradford Research recently highlighted that profits for minimills are up 50% to 100% compared to this time a year ago. In addition, Nucor is a well diversified and well positioned U.S. steel company. Over the last several years, the company focused on expanding its business in new areas such as Canada and Mexico to help combat geographic specific downturns. These precautionary actions should pave the way for tremendous growth going forward in addition to any potential comeback in the U.S. steel market. The company's 2016 EBITDA and EBITDA margin of $2,116 and 13.1%, respectively, reached a level not seen since 2008. Furthermore, the company's unique profit sharing price structure helped Nucor stay profitable though the steel industry's downturn as shown below. Nucor summary financials source. Nucor’s profit and returns are also well above its industry peers and the materials sector as a whole as illustrated below. Peers include: X, CMC, AKS, WOR, RS, AP and HNH. Nucor peer chart source. Nucor's Quality Margin Of Safety Nucor shares also look attractive on a fundamental cash flow basis. When applying Wall Street projections to eleven separate valuation analyses, finbox.io calculates an intrinsic value estimate of $62.75 that implies 8% upside. View all 11 valuation models that derive NUE's fair value estimate. Nucor is a diversified, high-quality business with a consistent track record and looks to be trading at a discount. A potential increase in global demand coupled with President Trump's trillion dollar investment plan and section 232 investigation provide additional upside for Nucor shareholders.

90	0	a	United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) shares jumped 7.2 percent on Wednesday after the company’s second-quarter earnings topped Wall Street’s expectations. However, comments from President Donald Trump about his ongoing investigation into U.S. steel imports this week may have taken the wind out of U.S. Steel’s sails, according to Longbow Research analyst Chris Olin. On Thursday, Olin downgraded U.S. Steel and rival AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) from Buy to Neutral after Trump said potential restrictions on U.S. steel imports under his Section 232 authority would be put on the backburner for now while Republicans focus on higher-priority issues such as healthcare and tax reform. Olin now sees only a 50 percent probability of a positive outcome from Trump’s investigation, down from a 70 percent chance just a month ago. “The uncertainty on the Trump Administration steel import policy was reflected in modestly slower steel activity,” Olin wrote. “Over the past few days, industry contacts suggested the channel returned to ‘business as usual,’ with customer orders and price expectations turning flattish.” Related Link: What Moves US Steel Shares More, Earnings Or Trump Talk On Trade? With U.S. Steel already up 19 percent in the past month, Olin sees little room for upside unless Trump can provide a meaningful boost to domestic steel prices. In the meantime, Longbow suggests investors focus on mini-mill names, such as Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). Olin likes these two companies’ exposure to nonresidential construction, lower HRC cost structures, relative insulation from the auto industry and their strong balance sheets. Longbow maintains Buy ratings on both stocks with a $66 price target for Nucor and a $40 price target for Steel Dynamics. ______ Image Credit: By Jim Mattis - 170720-D-SV709-006, Public Domain, via Wikimedia Commons

92	0	a	U.S. steel investors will be watching closely next week as two bellwethers for the domestic steel business are expected to release Q3 guidance. Jefferies analyst Seth Rosenfeld says Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) will likely disappoint Wall Street by guiding for Q3 EPS of around 80 cents, while Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) will come closer to consensus estimates by guiding for EPS of 65 cents. Update: On Friday morning, Nucor said it sees Q3 GAAP of 75 cents-80 cents, which doesn't compare to $1.02 estimates. Prior to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the U.S. steel industry was demonstrating surprising seasonal strength in the third quarter. Through early September, weekly U.S. production was up 4 percent year-over-year and up 1 percent compared to Q2. However, Rosenfeld says Harvey and Irma likely had a negative impact on the Q3 production and shipments of Nucor, Steel Dynamics and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC), all of which operate in the South. “Both NUE/STLD 3Q17 guidance expected next week may come below sell-side expectations, but likely match already cautious buy-side, with downside risks from recent hurricanes unknown,” Rosenfeld wrote. Despite headwinds from the hurricanes, the potential for an expanding metal spread into Q4 makes any guidance-related sell-off a buying opportunity next week. Jefferies anticipates United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) to maintain its previous full-year 2017 EBITDA guidance of $1.1 billion. Jefferies estimates Q3 U.S. HRC prices to average $626/ton, up $10 from Q2. Iron ore prices are also expected to jump $10 to $73/ton. HRC spreads are expected to decrease by $6 per ton to $262.

93	0	a	Shares of AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) fell more than 12 percent Tuesday morning after the company's third-quarter earnings report came in short of expectations. AK Steel reported a GAAP earnings per share loss of 2 cents on revenue of $1.49 billion. Wall Street analysts were expecting the company to earn 4 cents per share on revenue of $1.52 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter fell from $156.6 million, or 10.8 percent of net sales, a year ago to $69.2 million, or 4.6 percent of net sales. Total flat-rolled steel shipments fell 2 percent from a year ago to 1.3686 million tons due to softer demand from the automotive market, the company said. Average selling price per flat-rolled steel ton did rise 2 percent from a year ago to $1,021 due to the higher average selling price on contract and spot market sales and higher surcharges on specialty steels. Our financial results for the third quarter are in line with the guidance we provided in July. We are particularly pleased to have completed the acquisition of Precision Partners during the quarter as we execute on our downstream strategy, said Roger K. Newport, CEO of AK Steel. Our ongoing efforts to strengthen our balance sheet continued during the quarter with the successful refinancing of our 2022 senior notes and extension of our credit facility. These actions position us well for the future. Steel Stocks Lower AK Steel's poor earnings report was felt across nearly the entire steel and commodity sector although to various degrees. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X): down 4.99 percent at $25.12. Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST): down 2.91 percent at $14.37. Gerdau SA (ADR) (NYSE:GGB): down 1.63 percent at $3.32. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD): down 0.74 percent at $37.46. ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE:MT): down 0.59 at $28.74. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): down 0.19 percent at $58.36.

94	0	a	Offering its take on the steel sector — comprising carbon-sheet mills, carbon sheet distributors and raw material suppliers — KeyBanc Capital Markets said in a Monday note it maintains its selective view on carbon sector equities. U.S. sheet supply-demand momentum appears more balanced into 2018, supporting improvements in pricing and demand into the first quarter of 2018, said analyst Philip Gibbs. See also: Analyst Surveys Suggest Steel Stocks Will Soon Suffer Steel Dynamics' Discounted Valuation Liked Among the individual stocks, Gibbs said he likes Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD)'s relative sector discount on 2018 expectations. The discount comes despite the company's industry-leading return on invested capital, or ROIC, and organic and inorganic catalysts, the analyst said. (See Gibbs' track record here.) Reliance Steel Sparkles On Execution Additionally, Gibbs said he likes Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS)'s strong third-quarter execution. KeyBanc raised its forward estimates for the company. Neutral On Ryerson Holding> The firm downgraded shares of Ryerson Holding Corp (NYSE:RYI) from Overweight to Sector Weight, with the action blamed on its downgraded view of competitive FIFO gross margin environment in the distributor segment for 2018. The firm also sees operating margin pressure and lower-than-expected FCFE generation. The firm reduced its estimates for Ryerson Holding, Olympic Steel, Inc.

97	1	a	U.S. steel stocks are surging after the U.S. Commerce Department recommended that President Donald Trump enact a 24-percent tariff on all steel imports. Trump had ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, laying the groundwork for him to potentially use his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. The Commerce Dept. laid out three possible courses of action for the president: A blanket 24-percent tariff on all countries. A 50-percent tariff on the 12 largest U.S. importers and a quota equal to 100 percent of 2017 imports on all other countries. No tariff and a quota of 63 percent of 2017 imports on all countries. Investors clearly see the announcement as good news for domestic steel stocks. Here’s what analysts had to say. Voices From The Street Trump will likely opt for a tariff-and-quota scenario, said Morgan Stanley analyst Piyush Sood. “We think that the tariff-plus-quota scenario, with [a] 53-percent tariff against [the] selected 12 countries and [a] quota set to 100-percent (of 2017 import levels) is most likely to be adopted, the analyst said in a Monday note. Citigroup analyst Alexander Hacking said any of the three potential proposals the Commerce Dept. suggested would generate a significant tailwind for the domestic steel industry. “Prices would rise sharply, likely $150/ton, with [the] potential for shortages in the quota-limit scenarios,” Hacking said. Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen said the potential tariffs will be short-lived and may actually be designed to use as leverage in negotiations with exporting countries. “We still see significant problems with the structure of the Section 232 process and anticipate pushback from the Defense Dept. and other factions within the administration, which may hamper efforts to accelerate this process,” Allen said. Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Terry said quotas would have more immediate impact than tariffs. “Quotas on all countries will likely have the maximum impact as it would immediately support higher domestic utilization,” Terry said. BMO Capital Markets analyst David Gagliano said the major impact of the recommendation is that U.S. steel imports will likely drop. “We believe this will result in higher U.S. production, higher U.S. prices and lower unit costs,” he said. Credit Suisse analyst Curt Woodworth said Trump has plenty of motivation to act at this point. “In our view the president will likely follow through on some of these recommendations, given pressure from steel industry executives and the win it would serve up for his political base,” the analyst said. Price Action Here’s a rundown of how steel stocks are reacting to the news since Friday: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) is up 18.1 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) is up 12.9 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) is up 6.1 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is up 4.4 percent.

98	1	a	Goldman Sachs initiated bullish coverage on the metals and mining space, but the firm said investors still need to be selective about which stocks to buy. The Analyst Goldman analyst Matthew Korn set the following ratings and price targets for metals and mining stocks: Initiated Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) with a Buy rating and $23 target. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) with a Buy rating and $78 target. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) with a Buy rating and $59 target. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) with a Buy rating and $42 target. Constellium NV (NYSE:CSTM) with a Buy rating and $16 target. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) with a Sell rating and $25 target. Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI) with a Sell rating and $26 target. The Thesis Overall fundamentals in the North American mining and metals markets are very strong, Korn said. “Commodity prices are high, the supply side for metals and bulks looks more rational than it has been in years, M&M balance sheets are healthy (or at least healthier), and consumption has momentum from coordinated global growth, even as China gradually slows,” Korn said in the note. Korn said copper is the most attractive metal for Goldman at the moment, and Feeport McMoRan has the most copper exposure of the names mentioned. In addition, Korn said U.S. steel mills are expanding capacity with the support of new trade policy and aluminum demand is strong driven by a booming transportation industry. Price Action Here’s a look at how the stocks now covered by Goldman were following the initiation Tuesday: Freeport McMoRan was up 2.1 percent. Nucor was up 0.6 percent. Steel Dynamics was up 0.2 percent. Schnitzer was up 1.3 percent. Constellium was up 1.9 percent. Commercial Metals was down 0.4 percent. Allegheny Technologies was down 1.2 percent.

101	1	a	Since hitting a low of $19.65 on April 5, shares of Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) have gained about 23 percent, prompting Bank of America Merrill Lynch to revisit its rating on the equity. The Analyst Analyst Timna Tanners downgraded Commercial Metals from Neutral to Underperform and lowered the price target from $24 to $23. The Thesis Commercial Metals' valuation already reflects its much better-than-normal earnings power and its proposed plan to acquire four Gerdau U.S. rebar mills that's scheduled to close by the end of the year, Tanners said in a Tuesday note. (See the analyst's track record here.) On the downside, the analyst projects potential antitrust challenges to the Gerdau deal due to excess concentration, as imports now face a 25-percent Section 232 tariff, Tanners said. Taking into account the weakness of the Turkish lira — which is down 24 percent year-to-date — the price of imported rebar has dropped, resulting in a $125/ton discount to U.S. prices even after tariffs were applied, the analyst said. BofA expects U.S. rebar imports to rebound in Q4 after a summer dip, along with additional volume from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). The U.S. rebar market was oversupplied before the Trump administration's tariffs, Tanners said. Utilization remains below 80 percent, indicating limited pricing power, the analyst said. In recent midquarter updates on peers NUE and STLD we revisit valuation to use 'normal' multiples on conservative benchmark hot rolled coil and still find upside. BofA prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics to Commercial Metals. The Price Action Commercial Metals shares were down 3.86 percent at $23.15 at the time of publication Tuesday afternoon.

102	1	a	The Trump administration's trade decisions seem to be the theme of the quarter. Of the first 146 S&P 500 companies to report second-quarter earnings, more than 40 percent mentioned tariffs on their conference calls, according to CNBC. While Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) celebrated the positive impact of trade policy on finished steel and ore, most corporations lamented the tariffs. Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS), for example, warned of “just how terrible” a tariff or trade war would be. Here's a roundup of companies that attributed poor earnings, weak guidance or headwind expectations to the Trump trade approach. General Motors General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) missed earnings-per-share estimates while beating sales forecasts. Management said rising steel and aluminum prices most significantly challenged margins and forced a guidance cut. “We were very much on track to delivering that 10-percent [margin] expectation until some of these commodity price impacts started to build as we got into the second quarter and as we extrapolate that throughout the year,” CFO Chuck Stevens said on a media call, noting an indirect impact through suppliers. “ ... At least as we think about 2018, the primary drivers are index commodities, and about 30 to 35 percent of our raw materials index, so as prices go up, that's an automatic pass-through.” Stevens said that, in GM’s model, tariffs aren’t expected to impact the U.S. auto industry this year. Yet non-tariff actions could trickle down. China’s devaluation of the renminbi, seen to be a direct response to U.S. trade policy, was cited by GM as suppressive to China results. Fiat Chrysler Citing similar trouble in China, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) reported a year-over-year decline in its bottom line despite improving sales and shipments. It also trimmed full-year sales guidance. “[We're] not overly concerned today, but we obviously need to keep an eye on commodity prices as we move into 2019,” CFO Richard Palmer said in a conference call. FCA is developing contingency plans to diminish the impact of tariffs. Ford Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) missed bottom-line estimates despite a revenue beat. Duties hurt the automaker’s China business, and CFO Bob Shanks said on an analyst call that tariffs, particularly those on steel and aluminum imports, should cost Ford $1.6 billion in North America this year. Notably, immediately after the trio reported earnings, Trump struck a deal with the European Union not to raise tariffs on cars or trucks. Stanley Black & Decker Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) reported sizable beats in its top- and bottom-lines but predicted steel, aluminum and Chinese import tariffs would create a $35-million headwind in 2018. We have initiated price increases for these implemented tariffs and look to further mitigate the remaining impact via the formal exclusion process where applicable,” CFO Donald Allan Jr. said on the earnings call. “ ... Prior to mitigating actions, we estimate the annual impact to be approximately $70 million to $80 million. Therefore, if you assume, and it is an assumption, a Sept. 1 implementation, the 2018 impact could be approximately $25 million. 3M 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) missed revenue forecasts and lowered the upper end of its full-year bottom-line guidance, but exceeded EPS expectations. CFO Nick Gangestad said tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese imports, although a “fairly immaterial impact,” will cost the company about $10 million on an annualized basis. On the price of raw materials, we are likely seeing that our commodity prices and the increases we're seeing — they're likely at a peak level, Gangestad said. Our selling price projections are consistent with that, and that's part of our anticipation that, in a more stable world going forward with commodities, we'll continue to have our selling prices more than offset what we're now seeing for commodity price increases. PPG Industries PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) not only posted in-line EPS and a sales beat but also raised its dividend. Nonetheless, it conceded a cost impact from commodity price increases. “In particular, we are closely monitoring our business in China for any possible impacts,” CEO Michael McGarry said on the earnings call. “Currently, the new tariffs are starting to add some modest cost to our raw materials.” Alcoa Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) similarly beat estimates, no thanks to the $15-million in tariff costs imposed on imports from its Canadian and other foreign processing operations. Management cut annual EBITDA expectations, citing a $12 million to $14 million monthly cost impact from aluminum tariffs. ConocoPhillips ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) beat bottom-line estimates and raised 2018 production guidance, but management said steel tariffs are becoming a “fairly significant” cost that will impact capital spending next year. Danaher Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) surpassed second-quarter expectations and raised full-year EPS guidance, but management factored in a slight headwind from tariffs. “There is no one business at Danaher that has a significant impact, but it's a bunch of little impact across all the businesses and that adds up to that roughly sort of 1-cent-a-quarter impact,” CFO Daniel Comas said on the earnings call. General Electric General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) beat top- and bottom-line estimates but intimated that, with 10 percent of its $29 billion in imports coming from China, and $7 billion in revenue dependent on China, its exposure to the trade war could eventually cause harm. We don't see a major impact yet financially, certainly not on our 2018 guidance, CEO John Flannery said in his earnings call. We have a massively global business in every sense, both with the customers, supply chains, everything. W.W. Grainger W W Grainger Inc (NYSE:GWW) beat estimates and raised projections, but anticipates trade-related cost increases. We expect that we will see some supplier inflation related to tariffs in the second half, and we are confident in our ability to pass on price increases,” CFO Thomas Okray said on the earnings call. Kimberly Clark Kimberly Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB) beat EPS forecasts while missing revenue estimates and slicing its annual bottom-line and net sales guidance. Management blamed $200 million in higher raw material costs. “When you have a commodity impact as large and as significant as it is right now, I think our customers understand that,” CFO Maria Henry told analysts. Intuitive Surgical Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) beat top- and bottom-line estimates, although management qualitatively guided for a tariff-related hit that the company will absorb. “We think that the estimated impact will be modest in terms of the increase in product cost for our systems,” CFO Marshall Mohr said on the call. “That's not a cost or a level that we're going to pass any of those costs on to customers at this point in time. Coca-Cola The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) beat estimates but, partially due to increased metal prices, said it is raising prices on sodas in North America and foresees bottlers and retailers passing the increases to consumers. Illinois Tool Works Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) achieved in-line EPS but missed sales estimates and issued full-year guidance below expectations. Management said tariffs represent between 10 percent and 15 percent of total projected cost inflation for 2018. Union Pacific Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) exceeded earnings estimates but acknowledged tariffs as a hindrance. “We have seen some very specific impacts on us, but they're pretty granular, right?” CEO Lance Fritz said on the earnings call. “Inbound on some rail that we buy from Japan, there was a substantial 25-percent tariff on the last boat that was received. And then we've seen some other discrete impacts on customers. Harley-Davidson Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) beat revenue and EPS estimates but lowered its full-year operating-margin projections from between 9.5 and 10.5 percent to between 9 percent and 10 percent. The first half of the year saw 14.4-percent margins. As a result of the recently enacted tariffs, we expect to incur approximately $45 million to $55 million of increased costs,” CFO John Olin said on an analyst call. “This includes incremental costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million for steel and aluminum, and approximately $30 million to $35 million for EU tariffs.” McDonald’s Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) beat estimates and reported a 4-percent comps increase, but CEO Steve Easterbrook suggested that “uncertainty of trade discussions” is contributing to negative consumer counts in China restaurants. Whirlpool Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) missed both top- and bottom-line estimates and cut guidance well below forecasts. Tariffs were seen to weigh on margins and inspire an increase in 2018 guidance for raw material costs from $300 million to $350 million. Global steel cost has risen substantially and, particularly in the U.S., they have reached unexplainable levels, CEO Marc Bitzer said during the firm's earnings call. ... Uncertainty related to tariffs and global trade actions have also led to increased costs for certain strategic components and finished goods imports and exports.” United Tech United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) reported beats across the board and even raised guidance, but it also reported higher costs attributable to tariffs. Tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese imports stifled the firm’s EPS guidance raise by 5 cents. Anticipating an increase in steel and aluminum tariffs, CEO Gregory Hayes said 2019 will see a “much bigger impact” as the firm books commodities six to nine months in advance.

106	1	a	The U.S. steel industry has had a volatile couple of years with fluctuations in steel prices and uncertainty surrounding the fate of steel tariffs in an ongoing trade war. This week, several Wall Street analysts weighed in on steel stocks ahead of the G20 summit of world leaders. New Steel Mill After Monday's market close, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) announced plans to build a new $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion electric-arc-furnace (EAF) carbon sheet steel mill in the U.S. KeyBanc analyst Philip Gibbs said Steel Dynamics investors may have mixed feelings about the new mill. “U.S. carbon sheet-based stocks will likely be weaker tomorrow on the potential for further U.S. supply growth, while STLD investors may be a bit disappointed via potential for less bandwidth to pursue full-out share buyback momentum ($729M left at September's end),” Gibbs wrote in a note. Gibbs said the prospect of more steel supply in the U.S. market will likely weigh on steel prices and maintains a Sector Weight rating for Steel Dynamics stock. Steel Price Forecast On Tuesday, Longbow Research lowered its 2019 HRC steel spot price target by $10 to $15/ton and is now calling for 2019 prices to range between $790 and $795/ton. The new target represents roughly 5 percent downside from 2018 average prices. Despite the bearish adjustment, Longbow analyst Chris Olin reiterated his Buy rating and $40 price target for U.S. Steel (NYSE:X). “We believe the shares are significantly undervalued, even after adjusting for potential market headwinds,” Olin said. Sentiment Falling UBS analyst Andreas Bokkenheuser said net sentiment for the steel group declined in the third quarter. “Average Net Sentiment for all producers remained above global peers (possibly on account of Section 232 support), but directionally still down. We note that Net Sentiment serves as a potential leading indicator for operational performance,” Bokkenheuser wrote in a note. He said U.S. Steel has the highest net sentiment in the quarter, followed by Steel Dynamics, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS). UBS has the following ratings and price targets for the U.S. steel group: Nucor: Neutral, $63 target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral, $48 target. U.S. Steel: Sell, $28 target. AK Steel: Sell, $3.25 target.

107	0	a	Long considered an asset stronghold, Memphis welcomes big brokerages Small and midsize brokers still find Memphis market difficult If you're a broker who wants to play in the Memphis freight market, you'd better come with capacity at scale and a willingness to feel some pain in order to build long-term, meaningful relationships. That's what we've been hearing from brokers at Trident, Avenger, Redwood, and Echo (NASDAQ:ECHO). There's a huge volume of freight outbound from Memphis, but until recently large asset-based carriers like JB Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT), Schneider (NYSE:SNDR), Werner (NASDAQ:WERN), and Knight-Swift Transportation (NYSE:KNX) have had the market locked up. Only in the past few years have major 3PLs made headway with high-volume shippers, and small brokerages still don't feel welcome. Memphis, Tennessee is one of the strongest headhaul markets in the country, consistently producing more outbound freight than it takes in. Even though it's not a major market in terms of absolute volume—Memphis tenders about a third of the loads that Atlanta does—the imbalance between inbound and outbound freight is roughly equivalent to Los Angeles. But why? SONAR's headhaul index measures the balance between outbound and inbound freight for any given market: it's calculated each day by simply subtracting inbound volume from outbound volume. Memphis (HAUL.MEM) scored a 63.08 last Friday; for reference, Los Angeles (HAUL.LAX) was at 63.51 and Chicago (HAUL.CHI) posted a 45.43. The higher the score, the more outbound freight a market has compared to inbound. Memphis is one of the most lopsided freight markets in the country. (Map: FreightWaves SONAR) The lopsided freight flows in and out of Memphis mean that shippers have to pay more to secure outbound capacity. You can see how Memphis' high headhaul score puts capacity at a premium by comparing it to another market like New Orleans (HAUL.MSY), which has a headhaul score of 12. According to DAT's RateView tool, over the past seven days dry vans from Memphis to Atlanta brought in $2.29/mile net of fuel, while the rate from New Orleans to Atlanta averaged only $1.71/mile net of fuel. Those lanes have maintained a fairly stable 50-60 ct/mile spread. What makes Memphis such an important source of trucking freight? There are two major factors: transportation infrastructure and large shippers. Five of North America's Class 1 railroads meet in Memphis: CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), BNSF (NYSE:BRK), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), and Canadian National (NYSE:CNI). That junction has made Memphis the third largest rail hub in the country after Chicago and St. Louis. There are also a number of very large shippers, from steel manufacturers like Nucor (NYSE:NUE) and Big River Steel to International Paper (NYSE:IP). FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) headquarters in Memphis also makes it a destination for e-commerce shippers who move high-value product and who need large quality carriers they can trust. Nike (NYSE:NKE) has 2.5M square feet of distribution center space in the market; Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) has more than 1M square feet in nearby Olive Branch. Those needs have tended to put a damper on small and midsize brokerages looking for an entry point into the market. There's so much freight coming out, but from a brokerage standpoint it's very difficult, admitted Carter Garret, VP at Trident Transport. We don't have a lot of leverage… at the end of the day Memphis is an asset stronghold due in part to the rail spur. You have a lot of trucking companies in the area, and they have good relationships with those shippers and dominate the freight going back in. We've never been able to establish a strong presence there, said Rush Feldhacker, VP of Sales at Trident. I've never seen anybody have a great brokerage set up of any size there. It's one of those areas where you don't try to compete that much because you're at a disadvantage; you're just not able to compete on price. Spot rates on outbound Memphis are inflated—it's difficult to get a truck for a reasonable price. Don't miss it. Register today. An executive at another Chattanooga-based brokerage agreed, and also said that working with the railroads was difficult for asset-light providers. The other challenge from a brokerage standpoint is the rail, said Jason Roberts, Director of Business Development at Avenger Logistics. In my experience, we have a big challenge trying to handle business coming in and out of the rail yards, because the rail has very specific requirements as to who can and cannot come into the yard. They want our MC number on the truck and there's extra registration involved for each yard. I had to get a truck driver to put a piece of cardboard with our MC number on the side of his truck just to get into the rail yard. Memphis has been a well-priced headhaul market for a long time, Roberts said, and carriers strategically allocated assets to the area. Price isn't what keeps us out, Roberts said. The previously established relationships with the current customer base that's there is what keeps us from really being able to put a dent in it. The challenge for the brokerage is how do you establish that same relationship and fill that value proposition to those customers who are already doing business with those carriers, Roberts said. It's about pushing out carriers who aren't based in Memphis into that area more often—and we have to rely on the business being there in order to sell the same piece to our trucks going into that market. Two larger Chicago-based brokerages said they have had more success convincing big shippers to give them freight. My view of Memphis is that it's an extremely strong secondary market, said Christopher Thornycroft, SVP of Operations at Redwood Logistics. It's not by volume the same as Chicago, Atlanta, or Los Angeles—it's different in that way, but it's so sustainable because it's the largest DC network in the country. Therefore you have carriers who have a heavy stream of regular freight, plus a just-in-time market that establishes itself. Redwood has more than 200 active carriers out of Memphis proper, Thornycroft said, and forty of those are designated as ‘strong relationships.' It's a market that gets impacted by produce, by retail, even by back-to-school, Thornycroft added. If there is a market out there, it touches Memphis. That does make it more difficult for some brokers to get involved, because you've got to have some skin in the game. A pricing algorithm is going to expose you to loss and you have to be able to hang on and grit your teeth, especially in the beginning years. It's a game of figuring out what don't [asset-based carriers] want, and if that's the case, it has its difficulties as well. But where there's pain, there's often opportunity, Thornycroft said. Adam Markman, Division VP at Echo Global Logistics, said that since about 2014 supply chain managers at large shippers have begun changing how they think about their transportation needs. Flexibility and creativity are now considered paramount, which has been a boon to 3PLs with access to lots of capacity. Supply chain managers say ‘this is how it was last year, not sure how it's gonna be this year,' Markman said. There can be multiple swings based on pricing and seasonality and some challenges based on shippers and relationships, but as the market has evolved over the last couple years, we've done well. There are larger corporations and shippers in Memphis who control a lot of the capacity, so you have to make adjustments based on that, Markman said, noting that 3PLs had a role to play on weekends and fulfilling otherwise difficult load/unload times.

112	0	a	On May 14, U.S. President Donald Trump credited hit tariffs on imported steel with rebuilding the U.S. steel industry, which he said is now “booming.” However, shares of North Carolina steel producer Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) are down 25.9 percent in the past year, and one analyst double downgraded the stock on Friday. The Analyst Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners downgraded Nucor from Buy to Underperform and lowered her price target from $68 to $50. Tanners also made the following price target changes to steel stocks under her coverage: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $1 to $1. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $18 to $13. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $98 to $90. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $40 to $30. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $12 to $8. The Thesis Tanners said Nucor will likely be one of the first victims of what she calls a “steelmageddon” supply glut that will persist through 2021. As a result of oversupply concerns, Bank of America cut its 2022 benchmark hot rolled coil steel price forecast from $590/ton to just $475/ton. “Given a worse 2019E price view, risks of peak demand, and a looming supply glut in 2020-2021E, we see limited catalysts for the group and expect little incrementally positive from its June 20 investor day,” Tanners wrote in the note. Tanners said the supply glut will hurt all U.S. steel companies, but Steel Dynamics will be most immune given its attractive valuation, strong balance sheet, and near-term expansion opportunities. Price Action Nucor shares traded lower by 2.7 percent to $47.94 on Friday.

116	0	a	The steel industry's cup of woes overflows, as evidenced by a string of warnings from a few of the biggest players in the sector. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) became the latest to warn of worsening fundamentals when it made a third-quarter pre-announcement late Wednesday. U.S. Steel shares were sinking 13.455 to $10.78 at the time of publication Thursday. Way Off The Mark The steelmaker said in a release it expects third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million, which excluded a $53-million impact from a fire at its Clairton coke making facility and estimated restructuring charges. The Pittsburg-based company now expects an adjusted third-quarter loss of 35 cents per share, notably wider than the 7-cent per share loss estimated by analysts, on average. Brittle Fundamentals After the strength witnessed in the summer, the flat-rolled steel market has softened, U.S. Steel said. The combination of falling steel prices through the second quarter and a bigger-than-expected drop in scrap prices will negatively impact flat-rolled earnings in the second half of the year, according to the company. U.S. Steel now expects full-year flat-rolled shipments to third-party customers to be 10.7 million tons, as it expects to idle two of its U.S. blast furnaces to match supply with demand forecasts. U.S. Steel also warned of a continued deterioration of market conditions in Europe, with the incongruence between steel selling prices and raw material costs pressuring margins. In line with its labor productivity strategy announced earlier, the company has thus far eliminated 1,800 positions of the planned 2,500 cuts planned by the end of 2021. Pressured by high import levels and weakening market conditions, the company's Tubular segment is expected to remain under pressure for the remainder of the year, U.S. Steel said. Not Alone In The Quagmire U.S. Steel's predicament is not company-specific, as two other big giants sounded the alarm in their guidance as well. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) pre-announced a third-quarter shortfall earlier this week, citing weakness in its steel mills and raw materials business. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) said Wednesday it expects third-quarter earnings of 68-70 cents per share, below the 71-cents-per-share consensus estimate, as shipments and average steel pricing of its sheet steel operations declined in the quarter.

117	0	a	Each earnings season, traders obsess over two numbers above all else: EPS and revenue. But seasoned traders know share prices often respond to the direction of EPS and revenue growth rather than their magnitude and size. A company with a low price-to-earnings ratio may look cheap to value investors at first glance. But if its EPS is declining over time, it could be a major red flag that something is fundamentally wrong with a company’s business model. Companies can milk earnings from businesses in secular decline for years, but those earnings declines almost always catch up to investors eventually. Largest Projected EPS Declines Many stocks experience short-term EPS fluctuations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. However, these 15 S&P 500 stocks are projected to have the largest EPS declines over the next five years, according to Finviz: Newell Co (NASDAQ:NWL), -14% growth. Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC), -13.8% growth. SL Green Realty Corp (NYSE:SLG), -10.8% growth. HollyFrontier Corp (NYSE:HFC), -10.3% growth. Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc (NYSE:DO), -10.1% growth. Delphi Technologies PLC (NYSE:DLPH), -9.8% growth. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), -9.6% growth. State Street Corp (NYSE:STT), -9.5% growth. Archer Daniels Midland Co (NYSE:ADM), -8.8% growth. Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC), -8.2% growth. Nektar Therapeutics (NASDAQ:NKTR), -7.3% growth. FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE:FE), -6.6% growth. Prologis Inc (NYSE:PLD), -6.0% growth. Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), -4.7% growth. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), -4.1% growth. Benzinga’s Take It may be tempting to buy some of these stocks give many of them trade at very attractive earnings multiples. However, unless they can stop the earnings bleeding in the near future, the heavy losses most of these stocks have endured in the past year will likely continue. Do you agree with this take?
