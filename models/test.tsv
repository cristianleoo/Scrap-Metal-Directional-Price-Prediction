The Importance of Insider Transactions Insider transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however an insider transaction can be an important factor in the investing decision. Insiders buying stock after a notable sell off can indicate an insider's long-term belief in the success of the company; insiders buying stock at new highs can be an indication the exec doesn't feel the stock is overvalued. Insiders who sell stock at new lows could be anticipating some capitulation moment. If the insider sells at new highs, it could point to the intention to take some profit and lock in a gain. Important Transaction Codes Wall Street tends to focus on insider transactions which take place in the open market, viewed inside a Form 4 filing via codes P for purchase and S for sale. An open-market transaction means the insider went into the market of their own volition and made an active decision about the potential path for a company and its stock moving forward. Transaction codes other than P or S are often viewed with less conviction as they are often not tied to a decision by the exec. As an example, transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option.

Nucor's Debt According to the Nucor's most recent balance sheet as reported on November 12, 2020, total debt is at $5.53 billion, with $5.45 billion in long-term debt and $74.25 million in current debt. Adjusting for $2.87 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $2.66 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Nucor's $19.52 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.28. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

5	1	a	Steel stocks have been heating up this week, with bullish moves in a few tickers. United States Steel Corp. (NYSE:X), Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Nucor Corp. (NASDAQ:NUE) are three steel movers. These stocks may be potential long-term investments. Below is a daily chart analysis for each of the three stocks. US Steel Daily Chart Analysis: The daily chart above shows there are three potentially key levels on the U.S Steel chart. The stock may have broken out of a channel. The stock was previously trading in a channel between the price levels of $20 and $25 before the stock broke above the $25 level. This $25 level needs to hold for the stock to see higher moves. Below the $25 level, the stock may not find support until the $20 level, and below $20 not until $16. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support. Steel Dynamics Daily Chart Analysis: The chart shows the stock has been in an uptrend throughout the last year, which can be shown by connecting the lows with a line. The stock recently broke above $44, an area it struggled to get over in the past. The stock then found support at this level. This is an area the stock may stay above in the future. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support. Nucor Daily Chart Analysis: Nucor stock has taken off over the last week, making new highs. The chart recently broke above resistance of $67.50 and was able to retest it as support. This is an area where the stock may find support again in the future. If the stock were to fall below $67.50, it might not find support again until $57.50. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support.
6	0	a	Record U.S. steel prices have steel stocks soaring, but Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said Wednesday the steel stock party won’t last forever. Tanners recently did a deep dive on past steel price peaks and found a history of sharp drops in steel prices and stocks. History Lesson: So far, Tanners has seen no evidence that U.S. steel prices have reached the current cycle’s peak given new capacity has been delayed until late 2021. Hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel prices recently ranged between $1,400 and $1,500 per ton, more than double their 10-year average of $641. Prior steel price peaks in 2004, 2008, 2016 and 2018 suggest steel stocks will peak roughly a month before steel prices do, suggesting investors should be watching stock prices more closely than steel prices. Related Link: BofA Upgrades Steel Dynamics, Nucor Amid Record Steel Prices How To Play It: Tanners said past steel market corrections have hit higher-levered stocks hardest, which doesn’t bode well for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Instead, she prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), both of which should be able to offset the negative impact of falling steel prices by ramping up capacity. No matter what, Tanners said investors need to understand the risks in the steel space these days. “A cautious and nimble approach is best navigating cyclicals late in the price cycle amid an unprecedented steel bubble, in our opinion,” she wrote in a note. Benzinga’s Take: Record steel prices may not last, but both Nucor and Steel Dynamics appear to already be pricing in a pullback in steel prices at some point. Nucor shares trade at just 17.6 times forward earnings, while Steel Dynamics has a forward earnings multiple of just 13.7.
7	1	a	Jon Najarian said on CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report that somebody stepped in and bought the October $110 calls in Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) on Friday, expecting a $9 move between now and October. Najarian sees an even brighter future for Nucor so he bought calls in the name and he is probably going to hold them for three months. He also noticed some activity in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG). Traders were buying the June 4 expiration, $35 calls so they are hoping for a quick move higher. Najarian jumped in the trade and he is going to hold the position for four days.

9	1	a	Shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) saw some unusual options activity on Thursday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $103.7. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-10-15 Strike Price: $90.00 Volume: 345 Open Interest: 629 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

23	0	a	One old market adage that is commonly mentioned just ahead of the Jewish holidays is Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur. With the holidays commencing Sunday at sundown, it is time for this year's investment interpretation of the adage from the perspective of this investor. And boy, it is not easy. The 2022 holiday is certainly taking place during turbulent times in the U.S. and the world, and Friday’s price action is certainly not conjuring many bullish scenarios. Historical Origin: The rule's origin is based on the concept that followers of the Jewish faith want to be free from material possessions during the most sacred period of the calendar year. During the 10 days between the two major holidays, Jews reflect on their actions from the previous year and atone for their sins while setting a new agenda for the upcoming year. Upon completion of the cleansing process, they're free to return to the markets and evaluate investments for the upcoming year. Those who are ultra-religious may abstain from the markets altogether during this period. Mixed Results Over The Long-Term: No trading adage or strategy is 100% accurate over time. In 2021, following the original adage was a winning strategy. There was a rare occurrence last year when the market was closed for the Labor Day holiday. With Rosh Hashanah beginning at sundown on Monday, Sept. 6, the markets were closed. Therefore, the last trading day before the commencement of the holiday was Friday, Sept. 3, 2021. On that day, the S&P 500 cash index settled at 4,535.43. Following the 10 trading days and the conclusion of Yom Kippur on Thursday, Sept. 16, the first day to rebuy the index would have been on Friday, Sept. 17 at the opening price of 4,469.74. That marks a decline of 65.69 points or 1.5%, proving to be a winning strategy if employed in the aforementioned sequence. Of course, the index did go on to much higher prices until the beginning of the year, but if one was still holding the bag from that positioning, they would be deep in the red. With the cash index at 3,695, that makes for a decline of 774.74 points or 17%. Sell Rosh Hashanah Working Like A Charm: 2022 has been one of those rare years when “selling the rip” has been the right thing to do time and time again. Beginning with the first trading day of the year and until the late June low, the bears were in command. The bear market rally off that low took the cash index back to 4,325.28 in mid-August, but nearly all of those gains have withered away. A vast majority of the retreat has taken place following the worse-than-expected August CPI report that revealed inflation has not peaked. From the closing price (4,110.41) on Monday, Sept. 12 ahead of the report on Sept. 13 to its closing price (3,693.23), the index has skidded 417.18 points or 10.1%. The cash index is still roughly 26 points above its low close for the year at 3,666.77 Buy Yom Kippur? With the velocity with which the index has been falling, it could easily breach the June low on Monday. That is much sooner than the end of Yom Kippur, which is on Oct. 5. The next opportunity to repurchase the index according to the adage is on Oct. 6. At this time, it would take a brave soul to blindly initiate longs in a volatile bear market. The number of factors working against the market are numerous. Of course, the overbearing one is still increasing inflation, resulting in more interest rate hikes. The third-quarter earnings season is getting off to a rough start, even though it has not truly begun yet. This is evidenced by several companies already warning that earnings are going to come in below estimates. In the last week, the warnings have come from bellwethers for the economy FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). Before that it was Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), which has been hammered since its guidance cut, falling from $140 to $104. The macroeconomic environment is in disarray with the war in Ukraine and tensions between Taiwan and China that may drag the U.S. into the conflict. Finally, the relentless move higher of the U.S. dollar is punishing other countries that depend on U.S. products, Last but not least, the TINA trade (There Is No Alternative) to the market is dead. The constantly rising interest is draining trillions of dollars out of the stock market in search of some kind of yield, even if it is well below the rate of inflation. Moving Forward: For those investors that were waiting to redeploy their assets at a test of the June low, Friday was pretty darn close to that for the S&P 500. The solid rebound into the close will have investors pondering if this was another “buy the dip” opportunity.
