August 13, 2009 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2009 /T/ The Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) analyzes significant changes in the unaudited consolidated financial statements of Clairvest Group Inc. (Clairvest). It should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes of Clairvest for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 and the attached news release. All amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise indicated. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Clairvest prepares its financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In accordance with Accounting Guideline 18, Investment Companies (AcG-18), the Company designates its temporary investments and corporate investments as held-for-trading and carries them at fair value. Clairvest has also designated its receivables and payables as held-for-trading in accordance with Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook (CICA Handbook) Section 3855. Accordingly, each of Clairvest's financial assets and liabilities is fair valued on each consolidated balance sheet date. When a financial asset or liability is initially recognized, its fair value is generally the value of consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair value of an investment quoted on an active market is generally the bid price on the principal exchange the investment is traded on. Investments that are escrowed or otherwise restricted on sale or transfer are recorded at fair values which take into account the escrow terms or other restrictions. In determining the fair value for such investments, the Company considers the nature and length of the restriction, business risk of the investee company, its stage of development, market potential, relative trading volume and price volatility, liquidity and collateral of the security and the size of Clairvest's ownership block as well as any other factors that may be relevant to the ongoing and realizable value of the investments. The amounts at which Clairvest's publicly-traded investments could be disposed of may differ from this fair value and the differences could be material. Differences could arise as the value at which significant ownership positions are sold is often different than the quoted market price due to a variety of factors such as premiums paid for large blocks or discounts due to illiquidity. Estimated costs of disposition are not included in the fair value determination. In the absence of an active market, the fair values are determined by management using the appropriate valuation methodologies after considering the history and nature of the business; operating results and financial conditions; the general economic, industry and market conditions; capital market and transaction market conditions; contractual rights relating to the investment; public market comparables; private market transactions multiples and, where applicable, other pertinent considerations. The process of valuing investments for which no active market exists is inevitably based on inherent uncertainties and the resulting values may differ from values that would have been used had an active market existed. The amounts at which Clairvest's privately-held investments could be disposed of may differ from the fair value assigned and the differences could be material. Estimated costs of disposition are not included in the fair value determination. In determining the fair value of public company warrants, the underlying security for which is traded on a recognized securities exchange, and if there are sufficient and reliable observable market inputs, including exercise price and term of the warrants, market interest rate, and current market price, expected dividends and volatility of the underlying security, a valuation technique is used. If market inputs are insufficient or unreliable, the warrants are valued at intrinsic value, which is equal to the higher of the closing bid price of the underlying security, less the exercise price of the warrant, or nil. For private company warrants, the underlying security for which is not traded on a recognized securities exchange, the fair value is determined consistently with other investments which do not have an active market as described above. A change to an estimate with respect to Clairvest's corporate investments would impact corporate investments and unrealized gains/losses on corporate investments. The process of determining future income tax assets and liabilities requires management to exercise judgment while considering the anticipated timing of disposal of corporate investments, and proceeds thereon, tax planning strategies, changes in tax laws and rates, and loss carry-forwards. Future income tax assets are only recognized to the extent that in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that the future income tax asset will be realized. A change to an accounting estimate with respect to future income taxes would impact future tax asset or liability and income tax expense. OPERATING RESULTS Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 was $0.6 million compared with net income of $20.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 is comprised primarily of $0.9 million of net corporate investment losses, $1.3 million of net operating income and $0.2 million of income tax recoveries. This compares with net corporate investment gains of $25.8 million, $1.7 million of net operating losses, and 3.8 million of income tax expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2009. The net corporate investment losses of $0.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 comprised of $0.2 million of net realized gains on corporate investments and $1.1 million of net unrealized losses on corporate investments. Net realized gains on corporate investments for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 resulted from the repayment of a promissory note received on the sale of Shepell-fgi, which was previously carried at a discount. Net unrealized losses on corporate investments for the first quarter of 2010 resulted primarily from unrealized loss on Lyophilization Services of New England Inc. (LSNE) and N-Brook Mortgage LP (N-Brook) offset by an unrealized gain on Landauer Metropolitan Inc. (Landauer). Refer to Note 6 to the interim financial statements for detailed disclosure. Distributions and interest income for the quarter was $6.4 million, compared with $3.2 million for the same quarter last year. Distributions and interest income for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 included general partner distributions of $3.4 million from Clairvest Equity Partners Limited Partnership (CEP), net priority distributions of $1.1 million from Clairvest Equity Partners III Limited Partnership (CEP III), interest on cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments of $0.8 million and $0.7 million of unrealized gains on temporary investments. Distributions and interest income for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 included interest on cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments of $1.4 million, net priority distributions of $1.0 million from CEP III and distributions totaling $0.4 million from Wellington Financial Fund II and Wellington Financial Fund III (Wellington Funds). Clairvest earned $0.3 million in net management fees during the quarter for its services in the administration of CEP's portfolio and $0.2 million in advisory and other fees from its corporate investments. The CEP management fee is reduced to the extent of 75% of fees earned by Clairvest from joint Clairvest/CEP corporate investments. Administration and other expenses for the quarter were $5.9 million, compared with $5.6 million for the same quarter last year. Included in administrative and other expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 were performance based compensation expense totaling $3.5 million. Included in administrative and other expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 were $2.9 million in performance based compensation expense. Finance and foreign exchange gains of $0.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2010 represented foreign exchange gain of $0.4 million net of $0.1 million in interest expense and bank charges. The foreign exchange gains were driven by gains realized on U.S. dollar foreign exchange forward contracts entered into in anticipation of future investment gains. Finance and foreign exchange expense of $0.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 represented interest expense and bank charges. /T/ SUMMARY OF QUARTERLY RESULTS ---------------------------- Net income (loss) per Quarterly results Net income common share ($000's except per Gross Net income (loss) per fully diluted(i) share information) revenue $ (loss) $ common share $ $ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- June 30, 2009 6,003 662 0.04 0.04 March 31, 2009 8,643 3,822 0.24 0.23 December 31, 2008 1,658 (606) (0.04) (0.04) September 30, 2008 5,406 2,558 0.16 0.16 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- June 30, 2008 29,873 20,314 1.27 1.23 March 31, 2008 8,469 5,216 0.33 0.32 December 31, 2007 19,708 6,707 0.42 0.41 September 30, 2007 12,403 6,562 0.41 0.40 (i) The sum of reported quarterly net income (loss) per common share may not equal to the full year reported net income (loss) per common share due to rounding and on the fully diluted, the anti-dilutive effect of any quarters where the Company reported a net loss. /T/ Significant variations arise in the quarterly results due to unrealized gains/losses on corporate investments which result from Clairvest re-valuing its corporate investments on a quarterly basis. Corporate investments are re-valued when conditions warrant an adjustment to the fair value of the corporate investment. FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY Clairvest has sufficient capital to support its current and anticipated new investments. In addition to cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments of $179.1 million at June 30, 2009, Clairvest has a $20.0 million credit facility with a Canadian chartered bank, all of which was available at June 30, 2009. Cash equivalents consist of term deposits and fixed income mutual funds which have maturities less than 90 days from date of purchase. Temporary investments consist of guaranteed income contracts and corporate bonds rated not below A- and preferred shares rated not below P-3 which have maturities greater than 90 days from the date of purchase. The maturity dates of these temporary investments range from July 2009 through to April 2012. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, Clairvest filed a normal course issuer bid enabling it to purchase up to 797,678 common shares during the 12-month period ending March 5, 2010. No shares were purchased under the bid during the quarter. As at June 30, 2009, Clairvest had repurchased a total of 5,709,578 common and non-voting shares over the last six years. 15,953,566 common shares were outstanding at June 30, 2009. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Clairvest declared an annual dividend of $1.6 million, or $0.10 per share. Clairvest has corporate investments with a carrying value of $96.9 million. Changes in the carrying value of Clairvest's corporate investments during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 are primarily a result of investment realizations, net unrealized losses on corporate investments and follow-on investments made. Clairvest's corporate investments decreased $6.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Significant events relating to Clairvest's corporate investments, other than with respect to net unrealized losses, are described below. Casino New Brunswick During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Clairvest funded an additional $1.4 million of its $8.0 million commitment to invest in Casino New Brunswick in the form of debentures, which are non-interest bearing until Casino New Brunswick opens and bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum thereafter. At June 30, 2009, the total amount funded was $3.7 million. Landauer During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Clairvest acquired an additional 252,087 common shares of Landauer for $0.5 million. Shepell-fgi During fiscal 2009, Shepell-fgi sold substantially all of its assets to an unrelated third party. Clairvest received cash proceeds of $26.1 million at closing, and non-interest bearing promissory notes secured by the acquirer for an additional $15.3 million, payable through to July 2010, $9.7 of which had been repaid during fiscal 2009 at a slight discount. A further $4.4 million of the promissory notes were repaid by the acquirer during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Further repayment of the remaining $1.1 million promissory notes is subject to satisfaction of certain items in the purchase documentation, all of which may be received in the form of the acquirer's equity at the option of the acquirer. The remaining promissory notes are carried at a fair value of $0.9 million, which was determined by discounting the face value of the promissory notes at 20% per annum from their maturity dates. TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES A wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest (GP I) has entered into a Management Agreement with the General Partner of CEP, appointing GP I as the Manager of CEP. The General Partner is another wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest. The Management Agreement provides that a management fee be paid to GP I as compensation for its services in the administration of the portfolio of CEP. The fee was calculated annually as 2% of committed capital until the fifth anniversary of the last closing of CEP (August 21, 2006), and thereafter at 2% of contributed capital less distributions on account of capital and any write-downs of capital invested. The management fee is reduced to the extent of 75% of fees earned by Clairvest or GP I from corporate investments of CEP. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, GP I earned net management fees of $0.3 million as compensation for its services in the administration of the portfolio of CEP. As per the Management Agreement, fees of $0.1 million from corporate investments of CEP were netted against the management fees. The General Partner of CEP is entitled to participate in distributions made by CEP equal to 20% of net gains of CEP. These distributions to the General Partner will be determined based on the overall performance of CEP and no such distributions are permitted until CEP's limited partners have received amounts equal to the sum of their contributed capital and a return equal to 6% per annum compounded annually. The distributions received by the General Partner of CEP will be allocated 50% to each of its limited partners one of which is another wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest (Clairvest Subsidiary), and the other of which is another limited partnership (the Participation Partnership). The limited partners of the Participation Partnership are principals and employees of Clairvest and GP I (the Participation Investors). The Participation Investors have purchased, at fair market value, units of the Participation Partnership. From time to time, additional units in the Participation Partnership may be purchased by the Participation Investors. During the quarter, CEP declared $6.8 million of distributions to the General Partner, 50% of which, or $3.4 million, belongs to Clairvest Subsidiary and is included in income and in accounts receivable and other assets. The amount was received by Clairvest Subsidiary subsequent to quarter end. At June 30, 2009, CEP has declared distributions to the General Partner totaling $9.7 million, 50% of which, or $4.9 million, belongs to Clairvest Subsidiary. If CEP were to sell its corporate investments at their current fair values, the General Partner would receive up to a further $11.9 million of distributions, 50% of which, or $6.0 million, would be payable to Clairvest Subsidiary. Clairvest is also the parent company of the two General Partners of CEP III (GP I and GP II). GP I is entitled to a 2% priority distribution from CEP III. The 2% priority distribution began in August 2006, the month in which CEP III made its first investment. The priority distribution is reduced to the extent of 75% of any fees earned by GP I from corporate investments of CEP III. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, CEP III declared to GP I net priority distributions of $1.0 million. As per the Limited Partnership Agreement, fees of $0.1 million from corporate investments of CEP III were netted against the priority distributions. GP I is also entitled to distributions made by CEP III equal to 2% of net gains of CEP III determined as described below. To date, CEP III has not made any distributions to GP I other than priority distributions. GP II, a limited partnership, the General Partner of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest, is entitled to participate in distributions made by CEP III equal to 18% of net gains of CEP III. The distributions to GP II, and GP I as noted above, will be determined based on the overall performance of CEP III. No such distributions are permitted until CEP III's limited partners have received amounts equal to the sum of their contributed capital and a return equal to 8% per annum compounded annually. To date, CEP III has not made any distributions to GP II. If CEP III were to sell its corporate investments at their current fair values, GP I and GP II would not receive any distributions other than the priority distributions described above. Any distributions received by GP II will be allocated to each of its two limited partners, one of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest which will receive 44.4% of such distributions, and the other of which is another limited partnership (the Participation III Partnership) which will receive 55.6% of such distributions. The limited partners of the Participation III Partnership are principals and employees of Clairvest and GP I (the Participation III Investors). The Participation III Investors purchased, at fair market value, units of the Participation III Partnership. From time to time, additional units in the Participation III Partnership may be purchased by Participation III Investors. GP II is also entitled to a carried interest in respect of CEP III Co-Investment Limited Partnership (Clairvest LP) of 10% to June 23, 2008 and 8.25% thereafter. Clairvest LP was established in 2006 as the investment vehicle through which Clairvest would co-invest alongside CEP III. Distributions received by GP II from Clairvest LP will be allocated 100% to the Participation III Partnership. At June 30, 2009 Clairvest had loans receivable from certain officers of Clairvest and GP I (the Officers) totaling $0.7 million. The loans are interest bearing, have full recourse to the individual and are collateralized by the common shares of Clairvest purchased by the Officers with a market value of $0.6 million. At June 30, 2009, Clairvest also had loans receivable from certain officers of a company affiliated with Clairvest totaling $0.6 million. The loans are interest bearing and have full recourse to the individual. Included in accounts receivable and other assets are receivables of $2.5 million from Clairvest's investee companies, $5.8 million from CEP and $2.1 million from CEP III. Included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is $0.3 million owing to Clairvest's investee companies. Loans totaling $1.5 million, bearing interest at the prime rate made by the Company to CEP during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 were repaid in full during the quarter. Loans totaling $4.3 million, bearing interest at the prime rate, were made by the Company to CEP III during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and $4.2 million of loans were repaid by CEP III during the quarter. The total amount of loans outstanding to CEP III at June 30, 2009 was $8.6 million, all of which was repaid subsequent to quarter end. Interest of $9,000 was earned from loans to CEP III during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Clairvest earned $0.4 million in distributions and interest income, and $0.2 million in fee income from its investee companies. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS Clairvest has committed to co-invest alongside CEP in all investments undertaken by CEP. Clairvest's total co-investment commitment is $54.7 million, $3.5 million of which remains unfunded at June 30, 2009. Clairvest may only sell all or a portion of a corporate investment that is a joint investment with CEP if the manager of CEP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest, concurrently sells a proportionate number of securities of that corporate investment held by CEP. Clairvest has also committed to co-invest alongside CEP III in all investments undertaken by CEP III. Clairvest's total co-investment commitment is $75.0 million, $38.0 million of which remains unfunded at June 30, 2009. Clairvest may only sell all or a portion of a corporate investment that is a joint investment with CEP III if the manager of CEP III, a wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest, concurrently sells a proportionate number of securities of that corporate investment held by CEP III. Included in the commitment to co-invest with CEP III is an $8.0 million commitment to Casino New Brunswick, $3.7 million of which has been funded at June 30, 2009. Clairvest has committed $25.0 million to Wellington Fund III, $12.5 million of which has been funded to June 30, 2009. As a result of the closing of Wellington Fund III, any unfunded capital commitments to Wellington Fund II were extinguished. At June 30, 2009, net funds invested in Wellington Fund II were $0.5 million. At June 30, 2009, Clairvest has earned profit distributions totaling $1.9 million through its ownership interest in the general partners of the Wellington Funds. Clairvest has guaranteed, up to the amounts received from the respective general partners, the clawback provisions entered into by the general partners in the event the limited partners of the Wellington Funds do not meet their preferred rate of return as specified in the respective Limited Partnership Agreement. Clairvest has guaranteed up to $3.0 million of CEP's obligations to a Schedule 1 Canadian chartered bank under CEP's foreign exchange forward contracts with the bank. Clairvest and CEP III entered into a US$13.0 million credit facility agreement with a Schedule 1 Canadian chartered Bank to allow Clairvest and CEP III to enter into foreign exchange contracts. Clairvest and CEP III are jointly and severally liable on this credit facility. Under Clairvest's Management Incentive Bonus Program (the Program), a bonus of 10% of after-tax cash income and realizations on certain Clairvest's corporate investments would be paid to management as a bonus annually as applicable. Amounts are accrued under this Program to the extent that the cash income and investment realizations have occurred and the bonus has become payable. At June 30, 2009, $3.7 million has been accrued under the Program, $2.9 million of which pertains to fiscal 2009 and was paid subsequent to quarter end. If Clairvest were to sell its corporate investments at their current fair values, an additional bonus of $0.2 million would be owing to management under this Program. As no such realizations have occurred and the terms of the bonus plan with respect to these corporate investments have not yet been fulfilled, the additional $0.2 million has not been accrued at June 30, 2009. The Program does not apply to the income generated from investments made by Clairvest through Clairvest LP. Clairvest enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage the risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates on its foreign denominated investments. At June 30, 2009, Clairvest had entered into forward contracts to sell US$36.5 million at rates of Canadian $1.1487 to $1.2555 per U.S. dollar through April 2010. The fair value of these US dollar contracts at June 30, 2009 is a gain of $1.1 million. These contracts have been recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as derivative instruments. US$7.7 million of these forward contracts are in anticipation of future growth in value of the Company's U.S. denominated investments. The fair value of these contracts at June 30, 2009 is a gain of $30,000. Clairvest has also entered into forward contracts to sell Chilean UF0.7 million at rates of Canadian $41.7943 to $43.9144 per UF through January 2010. The fair value of these Chilean UF contracts at June 30, 2009 is a loss of $2.7 million. These contracts have been recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as derivative instruments. During fiscal 2006, Clairvest and a wholly-owned subsidiary sold their interests in Signature Security Group Holdings Pty Limited (Signature) and a related company as part of a sale of 100% of Signature and the related company. As part of the transaction, the subsidiary has indemnified the purchaser for various potential claims which will reduce over time. Clairvest, together with CEP, has guaranteed to fund any operating deficiencies of the Tsuu T'ina charitable casino for a specified period of time. The amount of the guarantee is allocated 75% to CEP, to the extent that the amounts paid thereunder are within the limits of the CEP Limited Partnership Agreement, with the remainder being allocated to Clairvest. Any amounts paid under the guarantee will result in additional debentures being granted to Clairvest and CEP, allocated on the same basis as the participation between Clairvest and CEP in the guarantee funding. As at June 30, 2009, no amounts subject to this guarantee have been funded. Clairvest, together with CEP III, has guaranteed to fund 50% of any operating deficiencies upon the opening of Casino del Sol for a specified period of time. Amounts paid under the guarantee will be allocated to CEP III to the extent that the amounts paid thereunder are within the limits of the CEP III Limited Partnership Agreement, with the remainder being allocated to Clairvest. Any amounts paid under the guarantee will result in additional equity being granted to Clairvest and CEP III, allocated on the same basis as the participation between Clairvest and CEP III in the guarantee funding. As at June 30, 2009, no amounts subject to this guarantee have been funded. As part of the holding structure of Casino del Sol, Clairvest, together with CEP III, borrowed $32.9 million through an acquisition entity from an unrelated financial institution, while another acquisition entity deposited $32.9 million with the financial institution as security for the loan. Clairvest intends to settle the loan, the deposit and related interest accruals simultaneously upon the divestiture of the investment in Casino del Sol, and as a result, the deposit and the loan, and the interest revenue and expense have been presented on a net basis. Clairvest's ownership of both acquisition vehicles was 23.8% at June 30, 2009, with CEP III owning 71.5% and the remaining owned by unrelated third party investors. As part of the holding structure of Latin Gaming Osorno S.A. (Casino Osorno), Clairvest borrowed $14.7 million through an acquisition entity from an unrelated financial institution, while another acquisition entity deposited $14.7 million with the financial institution as security for the loan. Clairvest intends to settle the loan, the deposit and related interest accruals simultaneously upon the divestiture of the investment in Casino Osorno, and as a result, the deposit and the loan, and the interest revenue and expense have been presented on a net basis. Clairvest's ownership of both acquisition vehicles was 100% at June 30, 2009. As part of the holding structure of Latin Gaming Chile S.A. (Latin Gaming Chile), Clairvest borrowed $4.9 million through an acquisition entity from an unrelated financial institution, while another acquisition entity deposited $4.9 million with the financial institution as security for the loan. Clairvest intends to settle the loan, the deposit and related interest accruals simultaneously upon the divestiture of the investment in Latin Gaming Chile, and as a result, the deposit and the loan, and the interest revenue and expense have been presented on a net basis. Clairvest's ownership of both acquisition vehicles was 100% at June 30, 2009. In connection with its normal business operations, Clairvest is from time to time named as a defendant in actions for damages and costs allegedly sustained by plaintiffs. While it is not possible to estimate the outcome of the various proceedings at this time, Clairvest does not believe that it will incur any material losses in connection with such actions. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Subsequent to quarter end, Clairvest completed the first closing of its new private equity investment pool which is comprised of a co-investment commitment from Clairvest and a new limited partnership, Clairvest Equity Partners IV Limited Partnership (CEP IV). The amount of the first closing was $200 million, half of which was committed by Clairvest. Clairvest has the right to increase its commitment to $125 million prior to the end of the fundraising period. CURRENT ENVIRONMENT Economic conditions continue to be difficult during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Clairvest, however, is in a strong capital position to benefit from this challenging and volatile market environment. The merchant banking business involves accepting risk for potential return, and is therefore affected by a number of economic factors, including changing economic environments, capital markets and interest rates. Clairvest continually reviews and adjusts its investment strategy and its capital resource allocation policies considering, amongst other factors, market conditions. The current environment is being carefully considered with respect to its impact on Clairvest's business. Clairvest's current liquidity position allows the Company to support its investee companies as appropriate and to take advantage of the current economic environment. The Company maintains a conservative liquidity position that exceeds all liabilities payable on demand. The Company invests its cash equivalents and temporary investments in liquid assets such that they are available to cover any potential funding commitments and guarantees. In addition, the Company maintains a credit facility with a Schedule 1 Canadian chartered bank. As of June 30, 2009, Clairvest's corporate investment portfolio is diversified across 11 companies in 6 industries and 3 countries. Concentration risk by industry and by country is disclosed in note 13 to the interim financial statements. Certain industries, particularly the automotive related industry, the oil field service industry and the financial services industry, may experience a significant negative impact to their profitability and liquidity positions given the current economic turmoil. The Company has considered these economic events and indicators in the valuation of its corporate investments. A number of investee companies may also be subject to foreign exchange risk. A significant change in foreign exchange rates can have an impact to the profitability of these entities and in turn the Company's carrying value of these corporate investments. Certain of the Company's corporate investments are also held in the form of subordinated debentures. Significant fluctuations in market interest rates can have a significant impact in the carrying value of these investments. Clairvest also actively reviews its hedging strategy to ensure the values of all foreign denominated investments are protected against currency fluctuations. The Company manages counterparty credit risk on derivative financial instruments by only contracting with counterparties which are Schedule 1 Canadian chartered banks. Clairvest is also subject to credit risk on its accounts receivables, the majority of which is with its investee companies. The Company manages this risk through its oversight responsibilities with existing investee companies and by reviewing the financial condition of investee companies regularly. Clairvest considers the capital it manages to be the amounts it has in cash, cash equivalents, temporary investments and corporate investments. Clairvest also manages the third-party capital invested in CEP and CEP III. At June 30, 2009, Clairvest had cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments of $179.1 million, in addition to $96.9 million of corporate investments. Clairvest also had access to $124.5 million of uncalled committed third-party capital for acquisitions through CEP and CEP III at June 30, 2009, which was increased to $224.5 million subsequent to quarter end as a result of the first closing of CEP IV. Clairvest's objectives in managing capital are disclosed in note 14 to the interim financial statements. TRANSITION TO INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Clairvest continued to evaluate the impact of adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and is in the process of developing a transition plan to IFRS. At June 30, 2009, the Company has not yet determined the impact of IFRS on Clairvest's consolidated financial statements. DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING In accordance with National Instrument 52-109, Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings, issued by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), management has evaluated the effectiveness of Clairvest's disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2009. Management has concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of June 30, 2009 based on this evaluation. National Instrument 52-109 also requires certification from the Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer to certify their responsibilities for establishing and maintaining internal controls with regards to the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles. Management has evaluated Clairvest's design effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Management has concluded that the design effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting are effective as of June 30, 2009 based on this evaluation. No changes were made to internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting. A number of the matters discussed in this MD&A deal with potential future circumstances and developments and may constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified as such because of the context of the statements and often include words such as the Company believes, anticipates, expects, plans, estimates or words of a similar nature. The forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The impact of any one risk factor on a particular forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty as such factors are interdependent upon other factors, and management's course of action would depend upon its assessment of the future considering all information then available. All subsequent forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, attributable to the Company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements. The Company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements should circumstances or management's estimates or opinions change. /T/ CLAIRVEST GROUP INC.

NOTES TO INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2009 (Tabular Dollar Amounts in Thousands) (unaudited) /T/ 1. NATURE OF ACTIVITIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION The disclosures contained in these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Clairvest Group Inc. (Clairvest or the Company) do not include all requirements of generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2009. In accordance with National Instrument 51-102 released by the Canadian Securities Administrators, the Company discloses that its auditors have not reviewed the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. In accordance with Accounting Guideline 18 (AcG-18), the Company designated its temporary investments and its corporate investments as held-for-trading and carries them at fair value. Clairvest has also designated its receivables and payables as held-for-trading in accordance with the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants Handbook (CICA Handbook) Section 3855. Accordingly, each of Clairvest's financial assets and liabilities is fair valued on each consolidated balance sheet date. When a financial asset or liability is initially recognized, its fair value is generally the value of consideration paid or received. Subsequent to initial recognition, the fair value of an investment quoted on an active market is generally the bid price on the principal exchange the investment is traded on. Investments that are escrowed or otherwise restricted on sale or transfer are recorded at fair values which take into account the escrow terms or other restrictions. In determining the fair value for such investments, the Company considers the nature and length of the restriction, business risk of the investee company, its stage of development, market potential, relative trading volume and price volatility, liquidity and collateral of the security and the size of Clairvest's ownership block as well as any other factors that may be relevant to the ongoing and realizable value of the investments. The amounts at which Clairvest's publicly-traded investments could be disposed of may differ from this fair value and the differences could be material. Differences could arise as the value at which significant ownership positions are sold is often different than the quoted market price due to a variety of factors such as premiums paid for large blocks or discounts due to illiquidity. Estimated costs of disposition are not included in the fair value determination. In the absence of an active market, the fair values are determined by management using the appropriate valuation methodologies after considering the history and nature of the business; operating results and financial conditions; the general economic, industry and market conditions; capital market and transaction market conditions; contractual rights relating to the investment; public market comparables; private market transactions multiples and, where applicable, other pertinent considerations. The process of valuing investments for which no active market exists is inevitably based on inherent uncertainties and the resulting values may differ from values that would have been used had an active market existed. The amounts at which Clairvest's privately-held investments could be disposed of may differ from the fair value assigned and the differences could be material. Estimated costs of disposition are not included in the fair value determination. In determining the fair value of public company warrants, the underlying security for which is traded on a recognized securities exchange, and if there are sufficient and reliable observable market inputs, including exercise price and term of the warrants, market interest rate, and current market price, expected dividends and volatility of the underlying security, a valuation technique is used. If market inputs are insufficient or unreliable, the warrants are valued at intrinsic value, which is equal to the higher of the closing bid price of the underlying security, less the exercise price of the warrant, or nil. For private company warrants, the underlying security for which is not traded on a recognized securities exchange, the fair value is determined consistently with other investments which do not have an active market as described above. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are based upon accounting principles consistent with those used and described in the annual audited consolidated financial statements. 2. ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING POLICIES Effective fiscal 2010, the Company adopted the Emerging Issues Committee Abstract 173 (EIC-173), Credit Risk and the Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. EIC-173 requires the Company's own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparty to be taken into account in determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including derivative instruments. The adoption of EIC 173 did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2008, the Canadian Accounting Standards Board confirmed that the use of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) will be required for Canadian publicly accountable enterprises for years beginning on or after January 1, 2011. As a result, Clairvest must adopt IFRS commencing April 1, 2011. Clairvest is currently evaluating the impact of adopting IFRS. 3. BANKING FACILITY Clairvest has a $20.0 million line of credit available, bearing interest at prime plus 0.5%. The line of credit available at June 30, 2009 is $20.0 million (2009 - $20.0 million) and is based on debt covenants within the banking arrangement. No amounts were drawn during the quarter. 4. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS Cash equivalents consist of term deposits and fixed income mutual funds which have maturities less than 90 days from the date of purchase. Temporary investments have maturities greater than 90 days from the date of acquisition and through to April 2012. Temporary investments consist of corporate bonds guarantee investment contracts and preferred shares. The yield on these investments ranges between 2.1% and 5.6% (2009 - between 2.7% and 5.6%) with a weighted average rate of pre-tax return of 3.5% (2009 - 3.7%). /T/ June 30, 2009 March 31, 2009 --------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------- Due in 1 year Due after 1 or less year Total Total --------------------------------------------- Corporate Bonds $ 4,084 $ 43,866 $ 47,950 $ 51,585 Guarantee Investment Contracts - 21,894 21,894 - Preferred Shares - 2,513 2,513 5,507 Term Deposits - - - 15,048 --------------------------------------------- Total $ 4,084 $ 68,273 $ 72,357 $ 72,140 --------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------- /T/ 5.

Details of significant events are described below. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Clairvest funded an additional $1.4 million of its $8.0 million commitment to invest in Casino New Brunswick in the form of debentures, which are non-interest bearing until Casino New Brunswick opens and bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum thereafter. At June 30, 2009, the total amount funded was $3.7 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Clairvest acquired an additional 252,087 common shares of Landauer Metropolitan Inc. (Landauer) for $0.5 million. As result of the follow on investment, Clairvest's interest in Landauer increased to 13.9% on a fully-diluted basis. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Clairvest determined that the carrying value of Lyophilization Service of New England Inc. (LSNE) should be written down a further $1.2 million as a result of the continuing uncertainty of its outlook. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Clairvest determined that the carrying value of N-Brook Mortgage LP should be written down a further $0.5 million as a result of the continuing uncertainty of its outlook. During fiscal 2009, Shepell-fgi sold substantially all of its assets to an unrelated third party. Clairvest received cash proceeds of $26.1 million at closing, and non-interest bearing promissory notes secured by the acquirer for an additional $15.3 million, payable through to July 2010, $9.7 of which had been repaid during fiscal 2009 at a slight discount. A further $4.4 million of the promissory notes were repaid by the acquirer during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Further repayment of the remaining $1.1 million promissory notes is subject to satisfaction of certain items in the purchase documentation, all of which may be received in the form of the acquirer's equity at the option of the acquirer. The remaining promissory notes are included in other investments and are carried at a fair value of $0.9 million, which was determined by discounting the face value of the promissory notes at 20% per annum from their maturity dates. 7. SHARE CAPITAL During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, the Company filed a normal course issuer bid enabling it to make purchases of up to 797,678 common shares in the 12-month period ending March 5, 2010. The Company made no purchases under this and previous issuer bid. In total 2,544,424 common shares at a cost of $21.9 million have been purchased under this, and previous, normal course issuer bids as of June 30, 2009. An additional 934,200 common and 2,230,954 non-voting shares have been purchased for cancellation from a financial institution outside of the normal course issuer bid. 15,953,566 common shares were outstanding at June 30, 2009. 8. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (a) A wholly-owned subsidiary of Clairvest (GP I) has entered into a Management Agreement with the General Partner of Clairvest Equity Partners Limited Partnership (CEP), appointing GP I as the Manager of CEP. The General Partner is another wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest. The Management Agreement provides that a management fee be paid to GP I as compensation for its services in the administration of the portfolio of CEP. The fee was calculated annually as 2% of committed capital until the fifth anniversary of the last closing of CEP (August 21, 2006), and thereafter at 2% of contributed capital less distributions on account of capital and any write-downs of capital invested. The management fee is reduced to the extent of 75% of fees earned by Clairvest or GP I from corporate investments of CEP. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, GP I earned net management fees of $0.3 million (2009 - $0.3 million) as compensation for its services in the administration of the portfolio of CEP. As per the Management Agreement, fees of $0.1 million (2009 - $0.1 million) from corporate investments of CEP were netted against the management fees. (b) The General Partner of CEP is entitled to participate in distributions made by CEP equal to 20% of net gains of CEP. These distributions to the General Partner will be determined based on the overall performance of CEP and no such distributions are permitted until CEP's limited partners have received amounts equal to the sum of their contributed capital and a return equal to 6% per annum compounded annually. The distributions received by the General Partner of CEP will be allocated 50% to each of its limited partners one of which is another wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest (Clairvest Subsidiary), and the other of which is another limited partnership (the Participation Partnership). The limited partners of the Participation Partnership are principals and employees of Clairvest and GP I (the Participation Investors). The Participation Investors have purchased, at fair market value, units of the Participation Partnership. From time to time, additional units in the Participation Partnership may be purchased by the Participation Investors. During the quarter, CEP declared $6.8 million (2009 - nil) of distributions to the General Partner, 50% of which, or $3.4 million, belongs to Clairvest Subsidiary and is included in accounts receivable and other assets. The amount was received by Clairvest Subsidiary subsequent to the quarter end. At June 30, 2009, CEP has declared distributions to the General Partner totaling $9.7 million, 50% of which, or $4.9 million, belongs to Clairvest Subsidiary. If CEP were to sell its corporate investments at their current fair values, the General Partner would receive up to a further $11.9 million of distributions, 50% of which, or $6.0 million, would be payable to Clairvest Subsidiary. (c) Clairvest is also the parent company of the two General Partners of CEP III (GP I and GP II). GP I is entitled to priority distribution from CEP III. The priority distribution is calculated monthly as 0.1667% of committed capital until the fifth anniversary of the month in which CEP III made its first investment (August 2006), and thereafter 0.1667% of contributed capital net of any write-downs of capital invested. The priority distribution is reduced to the extent of 75% of fees earned by GP I from corporate investments of CEP III. During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, CEP III declared to GP I net priority distributions of $1.0 million (2009 - $1.0 million). As per the Limited Partnership Agreement, fees of $0.1 million (2009 - $0.1 million) from corporate investments of CEP III were netted against the priority distributions. GP I is also entitled to distributions made by CEP III equal to 2% of gains of CEP III determined as described in note 8(d) below. To date, CEP III has not made any distributions to GP I other than priority distributions. (d) GP II, a limited partnership, the general partner of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clairvest, is entitled to participate in distributions made by CEP III equal to 18% of net gains of CEP III. These distributions to GP II, and GP I as noted in note 8(c) above, will be determined based on the overall performance of CEP III. No such distributions are permitted until CEP III's limited partners have received amounts equal to the sum of their contributed capital and a return equal to 8% per annum compounded annually. To date, CEP III has not made any distributions to GP II. If CEP III were to sell its corporate investments at their current fair values, no distributions would be paid to GP I and GP II. Any distributions received by GP II will be allocated to each of its two limited partners, one of which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Clairvest which will receive 44.4% of such distributions, and the other of which is another limited partnership (the Participation III Partnership) which will receive 55.6% of such distributions. The limited partners of the Participation III Partnership are principals and employees of Clairvest and GP I (the Participation III Investors). The Participation III Investors have purchased, at fair market value, units of the Participation III Partnership. From time to time, additional units in the Participation III Partnership may be purchased by Participation III Investors. (e) GP II is also entitled to a carried interest in respect of CEP III Co-Investment Limited Partnership (Clairvest LP) of 10% to June 23, 2008 and 8.25% thereafter. Clairvest LP was established in 2006 as the investment vehicle through which Clairvest would co-invest alongside CEP III. Distributions received by GP II from Clairvest LP will be allocated 100% to the Participation III Partnership. (f) Included in accounts receivable and other assets are share purchase loans made to certain officers of the Company and GP I totaling $0.7 million (2009 - $0.7 million). The share purchase loans bear interest fixed at the prime rate on the date of drawdown less 1%, interest is paid annually, and the loans have full recourse and are collateralized by the common shares of the Company purchased by the officers with a market value of $0.6 million (2009 - $0.5 million). Also included in accounts receivable and other assets are other loans made to certain officers of a company affiliated with Clairvest totaling $0.6 million (2009 - $0.6 million). The loans to officers of a company affiliated with Clairvest bear interest at rates commensurate with prime, and interest is paid quarterly. Loans are repayable upon departure of the officer. Interest of $13,000 was earned on the loans during the quarter. Also included in accounts receivable and other assets are receivables of $2.5 million (2009 -- $2.2 million) from Clairvest's investee companies, from CEP totaling $5.8 million (2009 - 1.8 million) and from CEP III totaling $2.1 million (2009 - $1.2 million). Included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is $0.3 million (2009 - $0.5 million) owing to Clairvest's investee companies. (g) Loans totaling $1.5 million, bearing interest at the prime rate made by the Company to CEP during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 were repaid in full during the quarter. (h) Loans totaling $4.3 million, bearing interest at the prime rate, were made by the Company to CEP III during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, and $4.2 million of loans were repaid by CEP III during the quarter. The total amount of loans outstanding to CEP III at June 30, 2009 was $8.6 million, all of which was repaid subsequent to quarter end. Interest of $9,000 was earned from loans to CEP III during the first quarter of fiscal 2010. (i) During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Clairvest earned $0.4 million (2009 - $0.7 million) in distributions and interest income and $0.2 million in fee income (2009 - $0.2 million) from its investee companies. 9. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, 35,000 options were exercised under the cash settlement plan for $0.3 million, $0.2 million of which had been accrued in previous quarters. Also during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, 35,000 options with a strike price of $12.63 and an expiry date of June 2019 were granted by the company to certain employees of GP I. At June 30, 2009, a total of 1,082,000 options were outstanding under Clairvest's stock option plan. As a result of a cash settlement feature in Clairvest's stock option plan, Clairvest recognizes compensation expense based upon the intrinsic value of the outstanding stock options at the balance sheet date, and the proportion of their vesting periods that have elapsed. For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, Clairvest recognized a stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million. As at June 30, 2009, $4.5 million (2009 - 3.1 million) has been accrued under the Company's stock option plan. As at June 30, 2009, a total of 145,354 (2009 - 123,636) Deferred Share Units were held by directors of the Company, the accrual in respect of which was $2.0 million (2009 - $1.4 million) and has been included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, Clairvest recognized an expense of $0.5 million with respect to Deferred Share Units.

US$7.7 million (2009 - US$7.1 million) of these forward contracts are in anticipation of future growth in the value of Clairvest's U.S. denominated investments, as described in Note 13. Forward contracts to sell Chilean Unidad de Fomento (UF) 0.7 million (2009 - UF0.7 million) at rates of Canadian $41.7943 to $43.9144 per UF through January 2010 (average rate of $41.8148; 2009 - average rate of $41.8148) . The fair value of these contracts at June 30, 2009 is a loss of $2.7 million (2009 - $2.3 million) and has been recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as derivative instruments. 12. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (a) Clairvest has committed to co-invest alongside CEP in all investments undertaken by CEP. Clairvest's total co-investment commitment is $54.7 million, $3.5 million (2009 - $4.0 million) of which remains unfunded at June 30, 2009. Clairvest may only sell all or a portion of a corporate investment that is a joint investment with CEP if the manager of CEP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest, concurrently sells a proportionate number of securities of that corporate investment held by CEP. (b) Clairvest has also committed to co-invest alongside CEP III in all investments undertaken by CEP III. Clairvest's total co-investment commitment is $75.0 million, $38.0 million (2009 - $39.8 million) of which remains unfunded at June 30, 2009. Clairvest may only sell all or a portion of a corporate investment that is a joint investment with CEP III if the manager of CEP III, a wholly owned subsidiary of Clairvest, concurrently sells a proportionate number of securities of that corporate investment held by CEP III. Included in the commitment to co-invest with CEP III is an $8.0 million commitment to Casino New Brunswick, $3.7 million (2009 - $2.3 million) of which has been funded at June 30, 2009. (c) Clairvest has also committed $25.0 million to Wellington Financial Fund III (Wellington Fund III), $12.5 million (2009 - $12.5 million) of which has been funded at June 30, 2009. As a result of the closing of Wellington Fund III, any unfunded capital commitments to Wellington Financial Fund II (Wellington Fund II) were extinguished. At June 30, 2009, net funds invested in Wellington Fund II were $0.5 million (2009 - $0.7 million). At June 30, 2009, Clairvest has received profit distributions totaling $1.9 million (2009 - $2.0 million) through its ownership interest in the general partner of Wellington Fund II and Wellington Fund III (the Wellington Funds). Clairvest has guaranteed, up to the amounts received from the respective general partners, the clawback provisions entered into by the general partners in the event the limited partners of the Wellington Funds do not meet their preferred rate of return as specified in the respective Limited Partnership Agreement. (d) Clairvest has guaranteed up to $3.0 million of CEP's obligations to a Schedule 1 Canadian chartered bank under CEP's foreign exchange forward contracts with the bank. (e) Clairvest and CEP III entered into a US$13.0 million credit facility agreement with a Schedule 1 Canadian chartered bank to allow Clairvest and CEP III to enter into foreign exchange contracts. Clairvest and CEP III are jointly and severally liable on this credit facility. (f) Under Clairvest's Incentive Bonus Program (the Program), a bonus of 10% of after-tax cash income and realizations on certain Clairvest's corporate investments would be paid to management as a bonus annually as applicable. Amounts are accrued under this Program to the extent that the cash income and investment realizations have occurred and the bonus has become payable. At June 30, 2009, $3.7 million (2008 - $2.8 million) has been accrued under the Program, $2.9 million of which pertains to fiscal 2009 and was paid subsequent to quarter end. If Clairvest were to sell its corporate investments at their current fair values, an additional bonus of $0.2 million would be owing to management under this Program. As no such realizations have occurred and the terms of the bonus plan with respect to these corporate investments have not yet been fulfilled, the additional $0.2 million has not been accrued at June 30, 2009. The Program does not apply to the income generated from investments made by Clairvest through Clairvest LP. (g) During fiscal 2006, Clairvest and a wholly-owned subsidiary sold their interests in Signature Security Group Holdings Pty Limited (Signature) and a related company as part of a sale of 100% of Signature and the related company. As part of the transaction, the wholly-owned subsidiary has indemnified the purchaser for various potential claims which will reduce over time. (h) Clairvest, together with CEP, has guaranteed to fund any operating deficiencies of the Tsuu T'ina charitable casino for a specified period of time. The amount of the guarantee is allocated 75% to CEP, to the extent that the amounts paid thereunder are within the limits of the CEP Limited Partnership Agreement, with the remainder being allocated to Clairvest. Any amounts paid under the guarantee will result in additional debentures being granted to Clairvest and CEP, allocated on the same basis as the participation between Clairvest and CEP in the guarantee funding. As at June 30, 2009, no amounts subject to this guarantee have been funded. (i) Clairvest, together with CEP III, has guaranteed to fund 50% of any operating deficiencies upon the opening of Casino del Sol for a specified period of time. Amounts paid under the guarantee will be allocated to CEP III, to the extent that the amounts paid thereunder are within the limits of the CEP III Limited Partnership Agreement, with the remainder being allocated to Clairvest. Any amounts paid under the guarantee will result in additional equity being granted to Clairvest and CEP III, allocated on the same basis as the participation between Clairvest and CEP III in the guarantee funding. As at June 30, 2009, no amounts subject to this guarantee have been funded. (j) As part of the holding structure of Casino del Sol, Clairvest, together with CEP III, borrowed $32.9 million through an acquisition entity from an unrelated financial institution, while another acquisition entity deposited $32.9 million with the financial institution as security for the loan. Clairvest intends to settle the loan, the deposit and related interest accruals simultaneously upon the divestiture of the investment in Casino del Sol, and as a result, the deposit and the loan, and the interest revenue and expense have been presented on a net basis. Clairvest's ownership of both acquisition vehicles was 23.8% at June 30, 2009, with CEP III owning 71.5% and the remaining owned by unrelated third party investors. (k) As part of the holding structure of Latin Gaming Osorno S.A. (Casino Osorno), Clairvest borrowed $14.7 through an acquisition entity from an unrelated financial institution, while another acquisition entity deposited $14.7 million with the financial institution as security for the loan. Clairvest intends to settle the loan, the deposit and related interest accruals simultaneously upon the divestiture of the investment in Casino Osorno, and as a result, the deposit and the loan, and the interest revenue and expense have been presented on a net basis. Clairvest's ownership of both acquisition vehicles was 100% at June 30, 2009. (l) As part of the holding structure of Latin Gaming Chile S.A. (Latin Gaming), Clairvest borrowed $4.9 million through an acquisition entity from an unrelated financial institution, while another acquisition entity deposited $4.9 million with the financial institution as security for the loan. Clairvest intends to settle the loan, the deposit and related interest accruals simultaneously upon the divestiture of the investment in Latin Gaming, and as a result, the deposit and the loan, and the interest revenue and expense have been presented on a net basis. Clairvest's ownership of both acquisition vehicles was 100% at June 30, 2009. (m) In connection with its normal business operations, the Company is from time to time named as a defendant in actions for damages and costs allegedly sustained by plaintiffs. While it is not possible to estimate the outcome of the various proceedings at this time, the Company does not believe that it will incur any material loss in connection with such actions. 13. RISK MANAGEMENT The merchant banking business involves accepting risk for potential return, and is therefore affected by a number of economic factors, including changing economic environments, capital markets and interest rates. As a result, the Company faces various risk factors, inherent in its normal business activities. These risk factors and how the Company manages these risk factors are described below. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of a financial loss occurring as a result of default of a counterparty on its obligations to the Company. For the quarter ended June 30, 2009, there were no material income effects on changes of credit risk on financial assets. The carrying values of financial assets subject to credit exposure at June 30, 2009 and March 31, 2009, net of any allowances for losses, were as follows: /T/ June 30 March 31 2009 2009 --------------------------------- --------------------------------- Cash and cash equivalents $ 106,788 $ 112,272 Temporary investments 72,357 72,140 Accounts receivable and other assets 12,024 6,719 Loans receivable 8,641 8,549 Corporate Investments 96,856 102,865 --------------------------------- $ 296,666 $ 302,545 --------------------------------- --------------------------------- /T/ The Company manages credit risk on corporate investments through thoughtful planning, strict investment criteria, significant due diligence of investment opportunities and oversight responsibilities with existing investee companies and by conducting activities in accordance with investment policies that are approved by the Board of Directors. Management's application of these policies is regularly monitored by the Board of Directors. Management and the Board of Directors review the financial condition of investee companies regularly. The Company is also subject to credit risk on its accounts receivables, the majority of which is with its investee companies. The Company manages this risk through its oversight responsibilities with existing investee companies and by reviewing the financial condition of investee companies regularly. The Company manages credit risk on cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments by conducting activities in accordance with the fixed income securities policy that is approved by the Audit Committee. The Company also manages credit risk by contracting with counterparties which are Schedule 1 Canadian chartered banks or through investment firms where Clairvest's funds are segregated and held in trust for Clairvest's benefit. Management's application of these policies is regularly monitored by the Audit Committee. Management and the Audit Committee review credit quality of cash equivalents and temporary investments regularly. The credit rating on the Company's cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments were as follows: /T/ June 30 March 31 2009 2009 -------------------- -------------------- Cash and term deposits 6,521 61,216 Guaranteed income contracts AA 20,188 15,048 AA- 1,706 - Bonds and fixed income mutual funds AA 31,296 8,194 AA- 17,648 19,291 A+ 2,424 8,100 A 11,349 10,999 A- 8,242 5,001 Preferred Shares P-1 low 1,997 1,982 P-2 - 421 P-2 low 107 - P-3 high - 2,004 P-3 409 801 P-4 - 299 Other fixed income investments R1-High 4,836 841 Other non-rated securities(i) 72,422 50,215 -------------------- Total cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments 179,145 184,412 -------------------- -------------------- (i) Included in other non-rated securities at June 30, 2009 are holdings in fixed income mutual funds where the lowest rating of its underlying holdings is R1-Low. /T/ Market risk Market risk includes exposure to fluctuations in the market value of the Company's investments, currency rates and interest rates. The Company's corporate investments have minimal exposure to market value risk. As at June 30, 2009, approximately 0.1% of the fair value of the Company's corporate investments was in publicly-traded companies. A sensitivity analysis on market risk is therefore not disclosed due to the Company's minimal exposure to market risk. Included in corporate investments are investments for which the fair values have been estimated based on assumptions that may not be supported by observable market prices. The most significant unobservable input is the multiple of earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) used for each individual investment. In determining the appropriate multiple, Clairvest considers i) public company multiples for companies in the same or similar businesses; ii) where information is known and believed to be reliable, multiples at which recent transactions in the industry occurred; and iii) multiples at which Clairvest invested in the company, or for follow-on investments or financings. The resulting multiple is adjusted, if necessary, to take into account differences between the investee company and those the Company selected for comparisons and factors include public versus private company, company size, same versus similar business, as well as with respect to the sustainability of the company's EBITDA and current economic environment. Investments which are valued using the EBITDA multiple approach include Kubra Data Transfer Ltd., Landauer, Light Tower Rentals Inc. and LSNE. If the Company had used an EBITDA multiple for each investment that was higher or lower by 0.5 times, the potential effect would be an increase or decrease of $5.0 million to the carrying value of corporate investments and net unrealized gains or losses on corporate investments, on a pre-tax basis for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. EBITDA multiples used are based on public company valuations as well as private market multiples for comparable companies. The Company's corporate investment portfolio is diversified across 11 companies in 6 industries and 3 countries as of June 30, 2009. Concentration risk by industry and by country is as follows: /T/ June 30, 2009 March 31, 2009 ------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------- United Fair United Fair Canada States Chile value Canada States Chile value ------------------------------------------------------------- Automotive related 3,750 - - 3,750 3,750 - - 3,750 Business services 903 5,504 - 6,407 5,062 5,962 - 11,024 Financial Services 16,532 - - 16,532 17,211 - - 17,211 Gaming 11,347 - 41,452 52,799 9,945 - 41,862 51,807 Health and medical related - 9,978 - 9,978 - 11,083 - 11,083 Oil field service - 6,793 - 6,793 - 7,368 - 7,368 Other 107 490 - 597 90 532 - 622 ------------------------------------------------------------- Total 32,639 22,765 41,452 96,856 36,058 24,945 41,862 102,865 ------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------- /T/ Certain industries, particularly the automotive related industry, the oil field service industry and the financial services industry, may experience significant negative impact to their profitability and liquidity positions given the current economic turmoil. The Company has considered these economic events and indicators in the valuation of its corporate investments. The company held $2.0 million in preferred shares of corporations in its temporary investments portfolio at June 30, 2009. Fluctuations between par value and market price did not exceed 7% during the period the shares were held. The Company also held $0.5 million in preferred shares of split corporations in its temporary investments portfolio at June 30, 2009. A sensitivity analysis on market risk is therefore not disclosed due to the Company's minimal exposure to market risk. The Company has implemented a hedging strategy because it has, directly and indirectly, several investments outside of Canada, currently in the United States and in Chile. In order to limit its exposure to changes in the value of foreign denominated currencies relative to the Canadian dollar, at June 30, 2009, Clairvest hedged 100% of the carrying value of its foreign investments. In addition, the Company has entered into foreign exchange contracts in anticipation of future growth in the value of its U.S. denominated investments. These contracts have notional values totaling US$7.7 million and a fair value of a gain of $30,000 at June 30, 2009. The Company manages counter party credit risk on derivative financial instruments by only contracting with counterparties which are Schedule 1 Canadian chartered banks. A number of investee companies are subject to foreign exchange risk. A significant change in foreign exchange rates can have a significant impact to the profitability of these entities and in turn the Company's carrying value of these corporate investments. The Company manages this risk through oversight responsibilities with existing investee companies and by reviewing the financial condition of investee companies regularly. Certain of the Company's corporate investments are also held in the form of subordinated debentures. Significant fluctuations in market interest rates can also have a significant impact in the carrying value of these investments. Fluctuations in market interest rates affect the Company's income derived from cash, cash equivalents, and temporary investments. For financial instruments which yield a floating interest income, the interest received is directly impacted by the prevailing market interest rate. The fair value of financial instruments which yield a fixed interest income would change when there is a change in the prevailing market interest rate. The Company manages interest rate risk on cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments by conducting activities in accordance with the fixed income securities policy that is approved by the Audit Committee. Management's application of these policies is regularly monitored by the Audit Committee. If interest rates were higher or lower by 0.25% per annum, the potential effect would be an increase or decrease of $0.1 million to distributions and interest income on a pre-tax basis for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they come due. See Note 12 which describes the Company's contingencies, commitments and guarantees. The Company maintains a conservative liquidity position that exceeds all liabilities payable on demand. The Company invests its cash equivalents and temporary investments in liquid assets such that they are available to cover any potential funding commitments and guarantees. In addition, The Company maintains a credit facility with a Schedule 1 Canadian chartered bank. 14. CAPITAL DISCLOSURES Clairvest considers the capital it manages to be the amounts it has in cash, cash equivalents, temporary investments and corporate investments. Clairvest also manages the third-party capital invested in CEP and CEP III. At June 30, 2009, Clairvest had cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments of $179.1 million (2009 - $184.4 million), in addition to $96.9 million (2009 - $102.9 million) of corporate investments. Clairvest also had access to $124.5 million (2009 - $131.2 million) of uncalled committed third-party capital for acquisitions through CEP and CEP III at June 30, 2009, which was increased to $224.5 million subsequent to quarter end as a result of the first closing of Clairvest Equity Partners IV Limited Partnership (CEP IV) (see note 15). Clairvest's objectives in managing capital are to: - Preserve a financially strong company with substantial liquidity such that funds are available to pursue new acquisitions and growth opportunities as well as to support its operations and the growth of its existing corporate investments; - Achieve an appropriate risk adjusted return on capital; - Build the long-term value of its corporate investments; and - Have appropriate levels of committed third-party capital available to invest along with Clairvest's capital. The management of third-party capital also provides management fees and/or priority distributions to Clairvest and the ability to enhance Clairvest's returns by earning a carried interest. 15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS Subsequent to quarter end, Clairvest completed the first closing of its new private equity investment pool which is comprised of a co-investment commitment from Clairvest and a new limited partnership, CEP IV. The amount of the first closing was $200 million, half of which was committed by Clairvest. Clairvest has the right to increase its commitment to $125 million prior to the end of the fundraising period. 16.

2009-08-14,"MIAMI, FL--(Marketwire - August 14, 2009) - Stock Market Alert's performance stock list includes: China Armco Metals, Inc. (OTCBB: CNAM), Titanium Metals Corp (NYSE: TIE), Dynamic Materials Corporation (NASDAQ: BOOM) and Horsehead Holding Corp. (NASDAQ: ZINC). Breaking News: China Armco Metals, Inc. (OTCBB: CNAM) reports record financial results for the Second Quarter and first six months of 2009. The company, a distributor of imported metal ore with plans to launch a new state of the art scrap metal recycling facility in China, issued a press release this morning announcing record second quarter financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2009. According to the release, financial highlights included: Revenue for the second quarter ended June 30, 2009 increased by 71.2% to $22.5 million compared to revenue of $13.01 million in the second quarter ended June 30, 2008. The increase in revenue was mainly attributable to increased sales from its metals distribution business in China as demand for metal ore rose significantly. Net income for the second quarter of 2009 was $3.37 million compared to $1.85 million in the second quarter of 2008. This increase was attributable to an improving pricing environment in metal ore in China coupled with the positive effects of China's November 2008 economic stimulus package. On a diluted basis, earnings per share for the second quarter of 2009 were $0.33 on 10.1 million common shares outstanding compared to $0.24 in the second quarter of 2008 on 2.5 million fewer shares. The press release goes on to state, the strong overall performance for the first six months of 2009 was largely driven by significant growth in our metals distribution business leading to record sales of $27.9 million for the first six months of 2009 compared to $22.79 million for the same period in 2008. Gross Profit for the first six months of 2009 was $4.63 million compared to $2.1 million for the first 6 months of 2008 period and net income was $3.5 million compared to $2.5 million which included a one-time gain of $1.2 million from a contract termination. On a diluted basis, earnings per share for the first six months of 2008 were $0.34 on 10.1 million common shares outstanding as compared to $0.38 in the same period in 2008 on 2.5 million fewer shares. At June 30, 2009, total assets were $38.13 million, an increase of over 30% from the $28.82 million at December 31, 2008. At June 30, 2009 total current assets reached $25.52 million and working capital was approximately $6.15 million. Shareholder equity reached $18.76 million with 10.1 million common shares outstanding up from $15.29 million at December 31, 2009. Commenting on the second quarter results, Mr. Kexuan Yao, CEO and Chairman of China Armco Metals, Inc., stated, We are extremely pleased with the strong performance of our operations in the first half of 2009. Our sales efforts in the second quarter benefited from a strong rebound in several key metal markets. We believe this momentum will continue in the coming quarters and we intend to make every effort to improve our operating results further. We believe our expanded credit lines, coupled with the anticipated launch of our scrap metal recycling facility later this year places the company in the strongest financial position in its history and poised for an extended period of exceptional growth for the benefit of our shareholders. This week, China Armco Metals also reported that it received a Back to Back secured Letter of Credit from DBS Bank Ltd. (DBS) on April 22, 2009 for up to $12 million to be used to finance purchases of various metal ores. DBS is one of the largest financial services groups in Asia, and its AA- and Aa1 credit ratings are among the highest in the Asia-Pacific region. Kexuan Yao, Chairman and CEO of China Armco Metals, Inc., commented We are extremely pleased to have secured this $12 million credit facility. We see continued evidence that the Chinese economy is on the road to recovery and there has been an increasing demand for commodities coupled with a rising price environment. We believe this additional financial flexibility will enable us to opportunistically grow our distribution business and significantly improve our overall operating results.

2009-08-17,"VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwire - Aug. 17, 2009) - Further to its news release of June 23, 2009, Highland Resources Inc. (the Company) (TSX VENTURE:HI) is pleased to report positive assay results from the initial field work on the Rickaby Property (the Property) that was completed by GeoVector Management Inc. of Ottawa, Ontario. The Property, comprised of 88 mineral claims over approximately 18,624 acres in the Beardmore-Geraldton Belt of the Thunder Bay Mining District, Ontario, is situated adjacent to Kodiak Exploration's Hercules gold project, where recent drill results included 15.59g/t over 16.60m (Kodiak, September 19, 2006), and channel sampling up to 32.96g/t over 11.60m (Kodiak, October 1st, 2007) has been reported. Part of the previously reported work program included channel sampling on the eastern portion of the Company's claim block adjacent to Mantis Mineral Corporation's historic Orphan mine claims. The Orphan Main vein was mined briefly in the 1930's and produced 3,525-tons of ore grading 0.689 ounces per ton gold. The Company's claims cover the eastern strike extension of this vein system and this area was extensively stripped in 2008 and exposed two new quartz veins. Channel sampling occurred over 60m of vein strike length, and assays of the veins had values of greater than 100 ppm Au over the entire strike length. Best intersections included 17.10 g/t Au over 1.20m and 1.12 g/t Au over 1.80m. In addition altered granite and mafic dykes adjacent to the veins contained grades up to 808 ppm Au over 0.80 meters. In addition to the channel sampling the Company collected prospecting grab samples on the western portions of the claim block. In the Zeus area, located adjacent to the Hercules property, recent trenching and drilling carried out by Kodiak extended up to the Company's claim boundary. Work by GeoVector included two grab samples taken on the Company's claims, approximately 60m north of the Kodiak property line. This area is suspected of being along the Hercules trend and these samples returned 3.76 g/t Au and 1.36 g/t Au in a quartz vein and an adjacent sericitic porphyry respectively. Both the channeling and prospecting results are considered very encouraging. The Company intends to carry out more channeling in the Orphan Mine area on other un-sampled veins exposed by trenching in 2008. These trenched areas will also be exposed over more of the strike length of the quartz veining. On the Zeus target the Company will carry out more comprehensive prospecting and expose the mineralized area by trenching to ascertain the strike and width of this zone. In addition to these two areas, channel sampling completed in 2008 on the KRK Zone in the central part of the property returned values of 1.07 g/t Au over 1.50m and 1.07%Pb and 1.59% Zn over 1.50m in massive sulphides in a felsic fragmental volcanic. This area also has extensive disseminated Cu mineralization reported from historical work (drill hole R98-22 returned 0.74% Cu over 71 meters). All these positive results are indicative of the potential for the Rickaby property, and it is anticipated that follow-up work will commence in the fall once a comprehensive study of the geology, structures and historical mineralization on the property is completed to guide future exploration programs. Activation Laboratories Ltd. (Actlabs) carried out the sample analysis in their Thunder Bay, Ontario facility. Samples were subjected to Actlabs' RX1 sample preparation which consists of crushing the entire sample to a nominal 10 mesh (1.7 mm) size, and pulverizing a 100 g sub-sample to 150 mesh (105 mm). A 30 g sub-sample of the pulverized sample was subjected to Actlabs' 1A2 analysis (Fire Assay with AA finish) and any analysis over 3000 ppb was re-assayed using Actlabs' 1A3 analysis (Fire Assay with gravimetric finish). Each sample was also analyzed using Actlabs' 1E3 analysis, which is an ICP/OES process for 37 elements. The work program at the Rickaby property was designed and conducted by Joseph Campbell, P. Geo., who is a qualified person under the definition of National Instrument 43-101. He is responsible for all aspects of the work including the quality control/quality assurance program. All samples collected were delivered directly to Activation Laboratories Ltd. Actlab's quality control system complies with ISO/IEC 17025 and CAN-P-1579. The technical information contained in this news release has been verified by Joseph Campbell, P. Geo., President of GeoVector, who is a Qualified Person as defined in National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Properties.

2009-08-18,"VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwire - Aug. 18, 2009) - High Desert Gold Corporation (HDG or the Company)(TSX VENTURE:HDG)(TSX VENTURE:HDG.WT) announces that the ongoing investigation of its wholly owned Kinkaid gold-copper property continues to generate significant gold mineralization from the rock chip sampling. The Company has now collected a total of 333 rock chip samples. Kinkaid is located approximately 24 kilometres northeast of Hawthorne, Nevada. HDG has continued to collect rock chip samples in an effort to characterize the gold mineralization and define drill targets. This recent work has outlined a series of five low-angle structures ranging in thickness from 2 to 6 metres, all of which contain gold mineralization. A total of 20 rock chip samples were collected from the structures over lengths ranging from 0.6 metres to 6.1 metres. Gold results ranged from 0.01 to 8.14 g/t with all samples averaging 1.31 g/t Au. Additionally, on July 2, 2008, the Company had reported representative samples from a total of 171 rock chip samples that had been collected from the Kinkaid property. (see HDG PR08-11, July 2, 2008). Previous work has identified copper and gold mineralization hosted in near-vertical epithermal/mesothermal veins ranging in thickness from less than 4 centimetres to over 1.3 metres in true width. The newly discovered low angle structures are low in silica, display dips of 10-50 degrees and are projected to intersect the near vertical gold-copper bearing veins at depth. The following table shows the results from rock sampling from the recently identified low angle structures: /T/ Summary of Selected Rock Chip Samples --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sample Number Sample Length Description Gold (gpt) --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Low-angle shear 144816 6 metres within limestone 8.14 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Parallel low-angle 144820 3 metres shear in limestone 0.556 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Low-angle shear 144837 2 metres within limestone 4.78 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Parallel low-angle 144840 2 metres shear within 1.125 limestone --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Low-angle shear zone 53868 2 metres within shale and 2.79 limestone --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Low-angle shear zone within shale and 53869 2 metres limestone, 0.716 continuing from the end of sample 53868 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Low-angle shear zone within shale and 53870 2 metres limestone, 0.911 continuing from the end of sample 53869 --------------------------------------------------------------------------- /T/ Mapping has also identified a calcareous sandstone that is interpreted to lie below the outcropping gold bearing vein systems. The intersection of the vein systems with the calcareous sandstone represents an excellent drill target for bulk gold mineralization. The potential target size is approximately 400 metres by 1,500 metres. The Company continues to seek a partner for its Canasta Dorada gold property in Sonora, Mexico where drilling has intersected greater than one gpt gold grades. Several companies are presently evaluating the property. The Qualified Person for this press release is Randall Moore, Executive VP of Exploration, High Desert Gold Corporation and he has reviewed and approved the content of this press release. Assays at Kinkaid were performed by ALS Chemex (ALS) Reno, Nevada laboratory which is an ISO 9001:2000 certified laboratory. Gold was analyzed by the Au-AA23 method that includes fire assay of a 30 gram sample with an AA finish. Certain statements contained herein constitute forward-looking statements.

2009-10-04,"Year 3, Week 9 Major Position ChangesTo see historic weekly fund changes click here OR the label at the bottom of this entry entitled 'fund positions'.Cash: 73.8% (v 67.4% last week)24 long bias: 21.1% (v 20.5% last week)5 short bias: 5.1% (v 12.1% last week)29 positions (vs 31 last week)Weekly thoughtsUS markets fell on back to back weeks for the first time since July; the S&P 500 dropped 1.8% and the NASDAQ shed 2.1%. It was a very pleasing week, not so much because the market fell but because for the first time in a long time it seemed as if the markets obeyed some old rules, especially of the technical analysis kind. James DePorre (Rev Shark) over at Realmoney.com said as much Friday afternoon:Technically, this is troubling action. We have been bailed out many times in the last few months just when it looked like we were ready to fall apart. Those crazy dip-buyers would aggressively chase the market straight back up and frustrate those who were trying to apply some basic concepts of chart reading. This time it is looking like the old-fashioned rules of TA may actually be kicking in. We had a light-volume bounce on Monday that quickly failed, and then another leg down on Thursday.While I cannot figure out the rally on Monday on no news, outside of mark up the quarter to make our books look better than they should be by institutions, the rest of the week was quite textbook and unlike many months this year, it actually felt like having many years of experience in the behavior of markets actually helped, rather than hindered. Blindly chasing was not rewarded, that's also a change. All in all, it was a flashback to times when automated computer orders who live in the world of momentum trading did not dominate everything and it was nice.Since a week ago Friday we had outlined a short term strategy of pressing down on the market on any break below S&P 1040 with a target of S&P 1020 - while Monday's rally pushed that to the side, it came to fruition this week. The game plan worked to perfection Thursday and Friday and a large part of this period's profits (every 4 weeks we measure ourselves in a period) will have come from a swift foray into put options on the S&P 500 as per our game plan.So now what? Well it depends if last week was a one week wonder where old rules applied, or if there is an actual sea change. Obviously we have no idea. If it is the former, we'd expect some more bouncing action after a retrace to a key moving average happened last week. If volume is pathetic (as it has been for months on end) this bounce should peter out in the weeks ahead and that should provide a heck of a great shorting opportunity. If however, nothing matters other than liquidity being thrown in the market to drive up nominal asset values while continuing to crush the dollar - then this was just a pit stop to further prosperity. Here are the key charts to consider ... it really has all just come down to the dollar as we've been saying repeatedly.Last week, the dollar was able to break over one key resistance, obviously getting over $78 would signify more game changing behavior. On the S&P 500 I'd like to add short exposure either on a more significant bounce OR a break down below the 50 day moving average. We've lightened up short exposure significantly at the end of the week as the S&P 500 is down 7 of the last 8 sessions and has given back a quick 5%. This is more of a tactical move as we await to see how the market acts, than any bullish condition. S&P 990 remains a key level for us, as a breakdown below that level would create our first lower low in many moons.Everything above has nothing to do with fundamentals or the economy... because frankly technicals have dominated things for much of the past few months. As we like to say in terms of economic or fundamental news it only matters when it matters. I was struck with the reaction to the economic news this past week - MUCH of it was NO DIFFERENT than the news we've been getting the previous 2-4 months. But in those time frames market participants were willing to get giddy over less bad or vague talk of green shoots. One could apply the same precepts to last week's data set, but this time they were not enough. So once more - the larger question: pitstop to further ignoring of reality and leaning on government to provide the consumption model of the US or change in character as market participants realize green shoots is all about the government ATM replacing the house ATM.Unlike last week the coming week is light in economic data. ISM services is Monday and really this report should get much more attention, rather than last week's ISM manufacturing since services now swamp manufacturing in America. It is also much harder for a government program to turbocharge the service economy as opposed to handing people $4500 to buy cars. Consumer credit comes Wednesday, and trade figures are Friday - normally the former figure is a non starter to the market but last month we saw an enormous (record breaking) contraction. We also begin earnings season with the traditional miss by Alcoa (AA). Ok, they only miss estimates 80% of the time... but the following weeks bring the heart of earnings. Which leads us to the next question:Can just beating analysts expectations (again) be enough, regardless of valuation? What we saw last quarter was stock after stock bid up furiously after losing only 18 cents rather than 28 cents. As long as you beat the analysts estimates it doesn't matter if your stock was valued at 50-80x forward estimates, you were bid up. I will assume analysts once again underestimate the golden era for corporations - they cut jobs (or outsource them) which drive down expenses; while government steals from future generations to give to consumers today, which helps maintain revenue at some subdued level. Effectively future generations subsidize the entire economy plus corporations profits. I expect a similar outcome this quarter and with the large banks reporting early, and everyone believing balance sheets no longer matter we can clap like seals when banks tell us how much money they make when the Federal Reserve destroys American savers by driving down rates to nothing; allowing banks to print money as long as they turn on the lights in the morning. All those old loans sitting in the dump on the balance sheet? No problemo; we're just going to keep rates ultra low until banks can earn enough to make all those problems go away. And for the rest of corporate America - see strategy above; slash workforce, beat analyst estimates, receive money from consumer via government - win, win win.This game will eventually end when analysts, being burned by being too conservative in estimates finally overreach and push expectations to a level companies cannot reach by slashing and burning even more American employees. I don't think that will be this quarter but something to ponder by middle of 2010. Unless we see real private demand return a real conundrum shall hit the market at that time. So again, the question will be are we willing to bid stocks now valued at 60,70,80x forward estimates up again just because they beat a headline estimate by analysts. This is all that seems to matter around earnings season, so I don't know at what point people begin to question paying 40x forward earnings for a retailer or 70x forward earnings for an industrial company. The justification of they'll grow into those earnings becomes harder to justify the farther into the stratosphere valuations go.The stock market's strong rally is facing its next test as companies gear up to announce third-quarter earnings that, while still weak, will very possibly be better than investors expect.Earnings in the first two quarters of the year that beat expectations helped propel the market's recovery, and the prospect of a repeat has even some bears wondering if they have been too pessimistic.One big reason for the market's continued strength is that expectations were so low for the economy and corporate earnings that the market was able to rise even on modestly good news.If you are expecting to lose a dime and you lost a nickel, you are a winner, says senior analyst Howard Silverblatt at Standard & Poor's.The parade of better-than-expected news began in this year's first quarter when S&P 500 profits fell 36%. Analysts had expected worse, so 65% of companies exceeded forecasts, according to Thomson Reuters.In the second quarter, although profits fell by almost a third, 73% of companies produced results that were less bad than expected. That tied the first quarter of 2004 for the highest percentage of companies beating estimates since Thomson Reuters started tracking such numbers 15 years ago, and it helped propel stocks still higher.Expectations remain low. Analysts forecast a 25% decline in third-quarter profits for companies in the S&P 500 compared with a year ago, not counting charges and special items, according to Thomson Reuters. When the quarter began, analysts had been forecasting a drop of 21%.For makers of industrial materials, analysts now forecast a 68% third-quarter profit drop. The expected profit decline for energy companies is 64%, for industrial companies, 45%, and for technology companies, 15%, Thomson Reuters says.So in the first quarter earnings fell by 36%, and in the second quarter by almost 33%, yet we bid up stocks on beat the analysts estimate at least! We'll see how many more quarters this can continue - due to the continued elevated status of weekly jobless claims it is probable the slashing of jobs will lead to more surprises this quarter to the positive for profits. I expect a litany of bad revenue numbers as was the case last quarter, but as a weaker currency helps exports some multinationals should also benefit from that situation.As always the importance will not necessarily be the news, but the reaction to the news - that is what I'll be studying in the next 4-5 weeks as we swig Kool Aid and tickle ourselves with green shoots.",1

World stocks were mostly up Monday after oil-rich Abu Dhabi said it will inject a $10 billion lifeline to save Dubai World from defaulting on its debt commitments. The news sent Dubai’s main stock market soaring more than 10% and helped ease worries about the emirate’s finances – for now. Also, Greece's Prime Minister Papandreou reportedly is expected to announce plans to trim the nation's bulging deficit later today. Meanwhile, Moody's (NYSE:MCO) said its top credit ratings for Great Britain and the US are expected to be in place, although a worst-case scenario could bring a cut by 2013. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 66 points, or 0.6%, to 10,471.50. The S&P 500 index advanced 4 points, or 0.4%, to 1,106.41. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite ended the day virtually unchanged. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing shares beat those that declined two to one on volume of 1.02 billion shares. On the week, the Dow average rose 0.8% for the week while the broad S&P 500 index rose for a third straight week, adding less than 0.1%. However, the tech-laden Nasdaq slipped 0.2% for the week. The greenback rose 0.9% during the week even as equity prices edged higher. Gold prices fell $6.30 to $1,119.80 an ounce. While the myriad of economic releases this week do carry weight, remarks from the Fed may prove the most significant. Most expect interest rates will be kept unchanged, with language suggesting an extended period of low rates likely, even as signs point to a healing economy.Zacks Investment Research",2

2009-12-21,"The markets are moving higher today on the back of solid moves from Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA), Amazon.com, Inc. (NasdaqGS: AMZN), Intel Corporation (NasdaqGS: INTC) and JP Morgan Chase Co (NYSE: JPM). Volume has started to trail off and is expected to starting around 10:30am ET each day this week. This is due to traders leaving early for the holidays and the lack of news after the morning session on Wall Street. This week we will see quite a bit of economic news, but it is all pushed into the pre market session or the 10am ET time frame. Once 10:30am comes around, traders will be essentially done for the day. Alcoa Inc. is higher today after a major deal with Saudi Arabia worth 10.8 billion dollars. In addition, Alcoa was upgraded by Morgan Stanley to overweight. While this upgrade is interesting to say the least, I believe it has come very late to the party. It does appear AA may have a little more upside but I would begin to use this upward momentum as an opportunity to unload positions. A pullback to $12 or below would be much more appealing. Amazon.com Inc. is having a solid day on the back of a blizzard that buried most of the north east of the United States. The key here was to recognize the snow storm was coming on Friday during trading hours and see that there was a high probability that it would cause an extra influx of online shopping. Near term, this seems to be boosting Amazon.com. While Amazon.com seems to be having a solid day, I would expect the pull back to continue after the holidays as profit taking continues. I think there is a large chance Amazon.com will pull back to the $110.00 level before being a solid entry once again. Intel Corp. is also one of the key DOW components keeping the markets up. It is up more than 2% on the day. Intel Corp. was raised to overweight from equal weight by a Barclays Capital analyst. This stock has been in a choppy trading range technically speaking. Being range bound, it may be in a consolidation pattern for a break out. However, watch the key $21.25 level. I would be mildly warm on this as the range from $18.50 to $21.25 looks to continue into the new year. JP Morgan Chase Co. is also helping the DOW and the markets head higher. Along with Goldman Sachs Grp (NYSE: GS), the financials are having a strong day. Over the weekend, comments were made from Barrons that the finanicals may have a bright future. JP Morgan Chase Co was highlighted as being the front runner to profits down the line. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) was noted as being the worst. While the financial stocks have pulled back off their highs, technically speaking, it bothers me the markets have not followed. The financial stocks continue to be a leading indicator to this market. Be aware that their weakness may be a signal of a 10% correction coming in January and February. Gareth Soloway Chief Market Strategist InTheMoneyStocks.com",1

2009-12-22,"In an interesting irony, market participants are excited about a steepening yield curve which typically indicates high-growth, while the GDP was revised to 2.2% from 2.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average entered positive territory on Monday, and Alcoa (NYSE: AA) was the biggest gainer. Alcoa rose 7.9%. The last time the yield curve was near current levels was in 1992 and 2003, when the economy was coming out of recession. But now, the Fed’s keeping short-term rates at zero will actually reduce the incentive for banks to lend. This in turn could warp economic growth. High demand for short-term Treasuries and falling demand for long-term Treasuries is may translate into a steeper curve, but it does not necessarily indicate robust growth ahead.",0
2009-12-22,"A series of corporate deal announcements and analyst upgrades of two Dow components returned to boost confidence on the Street and sent stocks sharply higher even as a controversial legislation to revamp the U.S. healthcare system inched closer toward finalization. The mergers and acquisition front witnessed a busy Monday as Bucyrus International (NASDAQ:BUCY) offered to buy the mining operations of Terex Corp. (NYSE:TEX) in a $1.3 billion all-cash deal. Giving healthcare issues a major lift was Sanofi-Aventis’ (NYSE:SNY) announcement to acquire retail health products maker Chattem (NASDAQ:CHTT) in a $1.9 billion deal. Premarket futures suggest a higher opening on the Wall Street, even as Moody's Investor Services (NYSE:MCO) became the third rating agency to downgrade Greece's government bonds.

Meanwhile, a number of analyst upgrades also helped the broader market yesterday. Alcoa Inc. (NYSE:AA), which entered into a $10.8 billion deal with the Saudi Arabian Mining Co. to develop a major mining operation, jumped 7.9% after Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) lifted the stock to “overweight. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) said it sees a tight market for aluminum pricing “well into 2010. The analyst increased the earnings estimate to 75 cents from 50 cents and the price target to $22. Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) added to the upbeat sentiment as it recommended shares of Mosaic (NYSE:MOS), and added Potash (NYSE:POT) to its Conviction Buy List, on positive outlook for fertilizer prices. Barclays Capital (NYSE:BCS) upgraded shares of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to overweight from market weight, basing its decision on seemingly solid end market conditions, an upward bias to estimates and intriguing valuation.

2009-12-24,"U.S. stocks closed higher for a fourth day on Wednesday as disappointment over a surprise drop in home sales was offset by strength in technology and commodities-related shares. Stocks declined in early trading after a Commerce Department report noted new home sales fell to their lowest level since March. The disappointment, however, was short-lived as markets gained momentum in the afternoon, helped by a rally in the oil market. Oil surged more than 3%, rising $2.27 to $76.67 a barrel on reports of a drawdown in supplies of crude last week. Higher crude prices helped energy producers and industrial companies. Also, ebbing enthusiasm about an economic recovery hurt the dollar, making commodities attractive. Shares of Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) rose 2% on a Barclay's (NYSE:BCS) upgrade. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day virtually unchanged, adding less than 0.1% to its prior day’s tally. The broader S&P 500 index gained about 2 points, or 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite advanced 17 points, or 0.7%, closing at a fresh 15-month high. For the year, the DJIA has gained over 19%, the S&P500 about 24%, and the NASDAQ about 44%. The Vix volatility index, the market’s fear gauge, inched up 0.4% to 19.63. The gauge slid below 20 for the first time since August 2008 on Tuesday. This morning’s stock futures suggest early market gains, following improved share prices in Asian markets and strength in European bourses. Yesterday, the greenback fell 0.4% to 77.86 against a basket of currencies, after rising to a three-month high in Tuesday's session, and following six straight session gains. A falling dollar nevertheless helped push commodity producer shares higher, with shares of Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) up 3.2% and Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) up 2.8%.

2009-12-29,"Century Aluminum (NASDAQ: CENX) is an elusive find. I say this because if you were lucky enough to snag some shares at the lows in early March you would have a sixteen-bagger on your hands. However, many of those gains have come in the last month alone, leaving the stock dangerously overbought in the short-run. On December 1st, Century Aluminum closed at $10.17. It’s closing price on December 28th was $16.34. That’s an astounding 60.7 percent gain in less than a month! The stock now sports an RSI of over 80 and is trading 47 percent above its 50-day moving average of 11.04.

The title of the article, which is shown below in its entirety, was called Metal Stocks Poised For 10% Or More Correction In Early 2010 After Massive Runup. U.S. Steel has already dropped in a major way, currently trading at $54.70. That is 5% correction in just 24 hours. The other stocks I mentioned have also already started to drop. This is just the start of the 10% or more correction I was talking about yesterday when I issued my red alert sell signal on all these metal stocks. The valuations were far too high short term, and the technical levels and analysis screamed to me that a correction was imminent. I issued my analysis, my alert and was locked and loaded. I have a red alert sell signal on each of these stocks until they reach a minimum of a 10% correction. I believe U.S Steel, Century Aluminum Company and Titanium Metals Corp. may correct as much as 15 - 20% before all is said and done. Alcoa Inc may only correct 10% or so.

Stocks like United States Steel (NYSE: X), Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA), Titanium Metals Corp (NYSE: TIE) and Century Aluminum Company (NasdaqGS: CENX) soaring into the end of 2009 like a rocket ship headed for the stars. Just in the last month or two, these metal stocks have ripped higher by 25 - 50%. It now looks like they are coming into massive resistance levels and I am issuing a red alert sell signal. Based on valuations, growth projections and technical extensions above key levels, these stocks have been added to my red alert drop list. I expect them to see 10% or more corrections in the near term of January. Already today, United States Steel has started to form a daily bearish candle along with Alcoa Inc. U.S Steel has rocketed higher since the hit of the 200ma on November 3rd, 2009 at $34.00 to a high today of $58.19. It is far above the 20ma and after a four day surge, multiple indicators are showing a January or sooner correction coming. Look for price to fall back to the 20ma. The same can be applied to all the other stocks listed. The extension moves they have had were due partly to short squeezes and partly to momentum runners as hedge fund and money managers looked to show these in their portfolios for year end statements. Come January or sooner, I am issuing a red alert sell signal on all these stocks. Be smart, learn the technicals, understand the fundamentals and go the opposite of the crowd. Learn, Live, Profit!

2009-12-29,"Bank of America maintains its “Underperform” ratings on Alcoa Incorporation (NYSE: AA) and Century Aluminum Company (NASDAQ: CENX), following release of the aluminum inventory data for the month of November by the International Aluminum Institute (IAI). During the month of November, IAI aluminum inventories (unwrought) were 1.1mt worldwide, down 5.6% on a sequential basis and down 29% vs. last year. Inventories are down 16% YTD and down 33% from peak levels earlier this year. Inventories have declined as global production has been cut 7% YTD. Inventory days on hand were 54 in November, up vs. 53 days in October. Days on hand have declined from a peak of 68 in May, 2009. Inventory days last bottomed at 22 in 2007 and last peaked at 111 days in 1993. Bank of America said that it expects days of supply to remain elevated as Chinese production continues to increase and underlying demand in US/Europe remains weak. IAI inventories have been on a declining trend since 3Q08 while LME inventories have stabilized since midyear. Primary inventories remain stable near the 6mt level. The research analyst at the firm, Kuni M. Chen, added that he continued to expect supply to outpace demand in 2010. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Commodities Team is forecasting a 2mt surplus for 2010. Annualized production is currently running at a 39mt pace while apparent demand is around 37mt. The research analysts further expect aluminum to lag other metals in a recovery, hence the “Underperform” ratings on Alcoa Incorporation and Century Aluminum Company.",0

2010-01-04,"2010 is expected to be the year when blockbuster IPOs will announce their arrival. Russian aluminum giant Rusal may just set the ball rolling on this front. The company plans to raise $2.6 billion in an initial public offering in Hong Kong, followed by a secondary listing in Euronext at Paris, thus giving US markets a miss. The company, in its filings, has reported a $868 million loss, and has warned that its ability to meet financial covenants is largely dependent on the pricing of aluminum. A 20% drop could seriously impact its books. Rivals like Rio Tinto (NYSE: RTO) and Alcoa (NYSE: AA) face similar woes, although not as severely as Rusal.",1
