2010-02-09,"Hedging With Gold Miners (AEM, GFI, NGD, DGL)","In the last period of sharply rising prices (the late 1970s), Gold shot from $100 to $850. This gold bull began at $250 9 years ago, and Gold bug such as hedge funds manager John Paulson believes it may peak well above $2,125 an ounce before this one's over. Last Thursday Gold price plummeted $50 as mounting debt worries out of Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain (PIGS countries) and boosted the dollar to a multi-month high. Is it still a good time to jump on the bandwagon? 4 Reasons to Hold Gold 1. Even though we're still in a deflationary environment, there will be a time when we have to worry about inflation as government spending continues to grow. 2. Central banks like India and China hold much more of their reserves in the U.S. dollar than in gold for economic and political reasons, but there's a clear, long-term diversification away from the greenback and Gold is benefit from this trend. 3. Gold’s price is highly correlated with political instability and has negative correlation with stock market (http://seekingalpha.com/article/149636-portfolio-diversification-is-key-consider-these-etfs). 4. In September 2009, Barrick Gold (ABX), the 2nd largest gold-mining company in North American, lifted its hedge against gold prices falling, an admission it expects gold prices to continue to rise. 18 Major Gold-Mining Companies # Name (Symbol) Mkt cap P/E Forward P/E (1yr) 1 Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) 35.23B - 13 2 GoldcorP (GG) 26.02B 23 28 3 Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) 22.66B 30 15 4 AngloGold Ashanti (AU) 13.92B - 16 5 Kinross Gold Corp (NYSE: KGC) 11.95B - 26 6 Agnico-Eagle Mines (NYSE: AEM) 8.48B 140 28 7 Gold Fields Limited (NYSE: GFI) 8.19B 27 9 8 Compania de Minas (NYSE: BVN) 7.85B 24 11 9 Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) 7.67B 22 14 10 Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD) 6.27B 118 - 11 Lihir Gold Limited (NASDAQ: LIHR) 6.24B - - 12 IAMGOLD Corp (NYSE: IAG) 5.15B 104 18 13 Eldorado Gold (NYSE: EGO) 4.94B 27 31 14 Harmony Gold Mining (NYSE: HMY) 4.03B 23 14 15 Royal Gold (NASDAQ: RGLD) 1.81B 41 30 16 New Gold Inc (AMEX: NGD) 1.64B - 18 17 Gammon Gold (NYSE: GRS) 1.27B 217 11 18 NovaGold Resources (AMEX: NG) 1.03B - - Gold mining companies have their own business risks influenced by many factors, such as the grade and depth of the deposit, financial as well as operation issues.

Conclusion According to Douglas Breeden, professor of Duke University, historical statistics are insufficient for accurately assessing risk. Since 1975, housing prices have never declined in the U.S. for a full 5 to 10 year period. Yet, price declines have occurred in 2008 and 2009 that have never been seen, or even imagined, since the Great Depression of the 1930s. One of the worst misuses of models is to look at history to determine the worst that has been seen and concluded that it is the worst that can be. The problem is that the historical scenario may not be bad enough. We need to think about circumstances that have not occurred but are possible. Besides its use in jewelry, gold serves very few functions. For protection against inflation, you can always use iShares Barclays TIPS Bond (TIP), or as Warren Buffett does: investing in companies that have the ability to pass on price increases. With average forward P/E of 19 for major gold mining stocks, it might indicate Gold is overvalued. However, no one knows when and where the next shoe will drop. Even without a potential new round of stimuli, current level of U.S. borrowing indicates that the U.S. dollar may depreciate over the long term. Sooner or later inflation might come. If the world really does falls into the cliff, gold might prove a nice insurance. I allocate a few pentane of my portfolio in gold mining stocks, just for a peace of mind.

2010-02-09,Inverse Dollar Trade 2/9/10,"All eyes will be on the US dollar as the risk aversion trade and news whether a bailout will or will not happen out of Europe continues to be the driving force. As noted in our commentary Monday, we expect some type of resolution and the flow of money that went into Treasuries and the dollar last week to find its way back to equities and commodities. Now for the trades: Oil put in an impressive showing today closing virtually 3% higher. We would still suggest waiting for the inventory number this week before committing fresh capital. We should have some new suggestions in the coming sessions. RBOB was higher by 2%; clients are long June call spreads anticipating a trade back near $2.15/2.20. Check out the United States Oil Fund (NYSE: USO). The USO is the ETF that tracks crude oil. Natural gas could go either way; we will look at longs closer to $5 and shorts closer to $6. In the middle of the range we have NO interest. Indices are rallying; we expect 1084 and then potentially 1100 in the S&P. On that, we will be buying clients June 1000 puts. Today’s price $1800, we will be working limits for less in the coming days. The USDA report was friendly to most agriculture products; as for softs, cotton was up the daily limit and OJ a gainer by 2.5%.Clients own no cotton but they are long OJ. They are still looking for a trade up to $1.50 and have gtc profit orders working. If we get a bailout in Europe expect Treasuries to fall back; we may look at selling NOB spreads in the coming sessions (short 30-yr/long 10-yr).Clients continue to scale into shorts in long dated Euro-dollars. I would’ve hoped for more out of corn today though prices were still higher on the day. We did not get a bullish reaction from the USDA but in 2 weeks if we get talk of planting delays or 6 weeks from now we get a bullish planting intentions report these levels may not be seen for some time. We like long exposure with a 3-6 month time frame. Clients were advised to take off their April live cattle calls at a profit today and to buy June futures against their April shorts. We expect this trade to play out with a move lower from here (exit April) and then a resumption of the uptrend (long June). On the exitm clients made approx. $600 which is about the same amount they are down on their April futures. The difference is they raised cash and lowered their exposure and margin. April lean hogs were unable to penetrate the trend line and closed back below the 20 day moving average. For now sit on your hands. Silver and gold were higher but we need to see an interim top in the US dollar to feel comfortable adding to client’s positions. If gold has consecutive closes back above the 50 day moving average I will reconsider; in April at $1086. Nothing new in silver; clients hold light long exposure. Check out iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). IAU is the ETF that tracks gold prices. The Euro/Yen cooperated today for a change as clients picked up just over $1800 on their spread. With some luck they will be out of this trade at a profit in the coming 48 hours. A trade to 1.3900 in the Euro or 1.1000 in the Yen is what we would be looking for. The dollar traded below the 20 day MA but closed above; use that level as your pivot point at 79.80. by: Matthew Bradbard, MB Wealth Originally written for MBWealth's Commodity Blog Risk Disclosure: The risk of loss in trading commodity futures and options can be substantial.

2010-02-24,Ignore the Noise 2/23/10 ,"Having a trading plan and ignoring the wild swings is vital in this environment. A doji star on the daily candlestick chart tells me that we may have hit an interim top yesterday. The low today in the April contract was within 6 cents of the 40 day moving; for now that level supports. We still think a trade down to the 200 day moving average is in the cards; in April that level comes in at $75.50. April natural gas traded to its lowest level since December 4th. On December 3rd this contract bottomed at $4.775 and within 30 days rallied 26%, is history about to repeat itself? We have not bought futures for clients yet but we expect to be a buyer in the next 24/48 hours in May and June. As for options we still like the June $5/5.50 call spreads. Equities were hit today, if the 100 day moving averages give way we should see more selling pressure. We continue to position our clients short the ES and S&P expecting a trade to 1000 by Memorial day. May sugar closed below the 100 day moving average for the first time in 10 weeks. We are not suggesting long futures until we get a turnaround which should be close. As for the May 25/30 1:2 ratio spread on further weakness we may buy back the 30 cent leg…stay tuned. We moved the coffee order from 300 to 220 and cut losses in the May $135/145 call spreads today for clients; a loss of $244/per. We wanted to sell Treasuries from higher levels and the market is delivering. We see upside resistance in June 30 yr bonds at 117′16 followed by 118′00. Agriculture gave back some of its gains from yesterday but as a whole there was no damage done to the charts. We continue to like long exposure in corn and soy meal and soybeans for the more aggressive trader. Live cattle started to roll over today; clients are positioned short in April puts and in a calendar spread long June and short April. As previously stated we are looking for a trade back to 89.00 in April futures which should get both of these trades profitable. April gold traded below $1100 today but as of this post is a couple dollars above that level. On a breach of that level on a closing basis expect 1165/1170 to come into play. We suggest the sidelines on futures and would be a buyer of August options on a further dip. The silver chart is uglier with prices losing almost 2.50% today. The trend line that has been in pace for the last 2 weeks held but we did close below the 200 day MA. With so much seasonal weakness unless the dollar comes off I would scale down your longs as a move back to $14.65 is not out of the question. It is OK to be in cash if you are unsure! We left the Euro longs today at a loss for clients today; they lost between 2-2.50 cents ($2500- $3125) on their Euro longs but we were able to offset about half that loss on short Yen and short Swiss Francs. As for currency exposure clients only hold June Yen call spreads which should work out well if futures make their way back to 1.1300.

2010-02-25,When Bad news is Good news 2/25/10,"It is not always how the report comes out but how the market reacts. Being oil has had trouble getting above $80 on a closing basis in recent sessions and charts are oversold we decided to get some short exposure for clients today. Intra-day prices were below both the 40 and 50 day moving averages but we did close above both levels. Braver traders than I can be short futures; we prefer to own May $75/70 put spreads for clients. They paid $1350/per today and will be looking to exit at $1900/2000 on a trade near $75. We have not acted on futures as of yet in natural gas but we think we will before the weekend, so that leaves tomorrow. The path in the immediate future in equities appears to be down; continue to sell rallies as the S&P should make its way to 1050 in the coming weeks. Clients got another opportunity to buy back their upper leg on their May 25/30 sugar spreads. We advised them to cover 1/2 their position so they are now in 1:1 25/30 call spreads. If the triple bottom holds from this week we should see a trade north of 26 cents in May futures. Out of nowhere cotton was up 2.5% today to fresh highs. Our clients are positioned short via a 90 call/74 put July fence. We will stay the course though it could be painful for a few sessions. We maintain that a trade under 75 cents is likely in the next 30 days. Treasuries are getting closer to where we would be interested in selling but we’ve yet to make a move for clients. As we said yesterday we see a trade up to 118′00 before there is any serious resistance. Inside day in corn but of all the agriculture it was down the least. We maintain our bullishness for clients via options and futures expecting 50/60 cents upside by the end of March. Tighten up stops on longs in soybeans and soy meal as they could re-visit the lows from 2 weeks ago. Clients were advised to book a profit on their long June live cattle and remain short the April. So now they own April puts and are short April futures anticipating a trade down to 89 cents. I was very delighted by the action in silver and gold today; albeit with a rumor on buying from China the turn around was impressive. April gold closed back above the 50 and 100 day moving averages and on some follow through tomorrow we will look to re-establish long futures for clients. Their only open position in gold is August $1150/1250 call spreads that are fighting back after today’s action. A bullish engulfing candle in silver today on good volume should mean that prices are heading north once again. Clients remain long via May and July calls and like gold if we get some upside follow thru tomorrow we would be interested in adding to long futures. We advised clients to lift their long Yen today at a small profit as prices were not able to get through 1.13. These positions were originally put on as a hedge and we no longer own that position. Clients own a very small position long the Euro via April 140 calls to take advantage of a potential move to 1.38/1.39 into next week.

2010-02-27,PHYS: Now You Can Store Your Gold in Canada,"Note (added 3/2/10): The article below contains an error. PHYS is actually a closed-end fund, not an ETF. For more information, see PHYS is Not an ETF. Sprott Physical Gold Trust (PHYS), the latest physically backed gold exchange-traded product began trading yesterday (2/26/10) on the NYSE. The fund also applied for listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol PHY, but it appears that Canadian trading has not yet commenced. The fund will be managed by Toronto-based Sprott Asset Management and will store its gold at the Royal Canadian Mint. With the introduction of PHYS, investors can now choose between physically backed ETFs that safeguards gold bullion in Zurich, Canada, London, and US vaults. The fund’s new website does not contain much information at this time. The prospectus highlights the potential benefits of the offering, which include: Ability to Redeem Units for Physical Gold Bullion: Unit holders will have the ability, on a monthly basis, to redeem their units for physical gold bullion in a minimum of one bar (350 to 430 troy ounces) for a redemption price equal to 100% of the NAV minus expenses. Storage at the Royal Canadian Mint: The Trust’s physical gold bullion will be fully allocated and stored at the Royal Canadian Mint. Potential Tax Advantage For U.S. Investors: Any gains realized on the sale of units for U.S. federal income tax purposes, may be taxable as long-term capital gains (at a maximum rate of 15% under current law, compared to a long-term capital gains tax rate of 28% applicable to physical gold bullion and other “collectibles”), provided that such U.S. investor has made a timely and valid Qualified Electing Fund election with respect to the units. Note: I recommend consulting a qualified tax specialist if you are relying on this claim. PHYS will have expenses capped at 0.65%, making it more expensive than its major competitors. PHYS traded more than four million shares on Friday and closed at $9.59. This means each unit worth less than 1/100 of an ounce. Its three prime competitors are: SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), expense ratio = 0.40% (overview) iShares COMEX Gold Trust (IAU), expense ratio = 0.40% (summary) (IAU article) ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (SGOL), expense ratio = 0.39% (summary) (launch article) In related news, Eric Sprott, CEO of Sprott Asset Management, purchased 8 million units of the new fund as part of the IPO. It’s nice to see that management believes in the product. Disclosure covering writer, editor, and publisher: Long GLD. No positions in any of the companies or ETF sponsors mentioned.

2010-03-01,March Forward Or Backward?? 3/1/10,"Crude was down just over 1% today closing almost $2 off its highs. We continue to suggest selling near $80/barrel expecting a trade near $75 in the coming weeks. We suggest on futures to have stops above $81, in options clients own May $75/70 put spreads. Natural gas was lower by almost 3% and though we are playing with fire we still like lightly buying April futures; buy 1/4 to 1/3 of the ultimate position you want to own and then add to it when the market confirms you are right. As for option traders we suggest purchasing the June $5/5.50 call spreads. We remain unconvinced a trade higher in Indices can hold and have advised clients to sell into this strength. We suggest scaling into shorts in the S&P at 1111 and 1125. Clients own June 1050 and 1000 ES puts and are slightly under water. We advised clients to buy back the remainder of their 30 cent sugar calls today. They booked a profit on their short 30’s and know hold May 25 cent calls and need a rally. The 200 day moving average held today in May at 21.92. Prices are oversold and have remained above the 200 day since April of 2009 when prices were under 15 cents/lb. Cotton was higher today but did mange to close 1.30 cents off its highs. Clients are positioned to take advantage of a break back below 75 cents this month. Bearish engulfing candles formed in the daily corn and wheat charts so a trade lower in the short term is likely. Those that have yet to get in corn we suggest using this set back to get on board. 5 days running live cattle have closed lower; we may get a brief rally but sell it as a trade to 89.00 cents is what we are predicting in the April contract. I am confused in the metals; prices could go either way. We have clients lightly long both gold and silver but would be quick to exit on a close below $1106 in April gold and below $16.08 in May silver. For new entries we suggest trading light! The currency market is absolutely madness as 1-2% daily swings are common place in a variety of crosses. We continue to think the dollar is topping and as long as the Euro-currency can hold the recent lows we think a moderate bounce is likely; 1.38/1.39. The Pound remains the dog and should be sold on rallies but only for traders with a high tolerance for risk.

2010-03-02,PHYS is Not an ETF,"I previously wrote an article entitled PHYS: Now You Can Store Your Gold in Canada. After discussions with Michael Traynor of the National Stock Exchange, I agree with their conclusion that PHYS is not an ETF. In some ways, PHYS is similar to other physically-backed gold products such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares COMEX Gold Trust (IAU), and ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (SGOL). However, it lacks one vital feature – the daily creation/redemption process. As I have said many times, this is the one feature that sets apart ETFs from other products. A closer inspection of the PHYS prospectus reveals that it is actually a “closed-end mutual fund trust.” As such, it is likely to trade at a premium or discount to intrinsic value, just like other closed-end funds. In fact, it appears PHYS is already trading at a premium. The shares climbed nearly 1.9% on Monday while GLD, IAU, and SGOL were nearly unchanged. However, PHYS does have a monthly redemption provision, which should prevent the premium or discount from becoming too large. Disclosure covering writer, editor, and publisher: Long GLD.

2010-03-03,Are The $ Correlations Back? 3/3/10,"The dollar cut thru the 20 day moving average like a hot knife thru butter and in just 2 days erased the previous 2 weeks of gains. The dollar is in control of the destiny of commodities in the short run. As we’ve voiced in recent posts we expect sideways to down in the dollar and the 9% appreciation since the first week of December was a gift. The Pound and Euro should catch a bid from here but I’m undecided if I want to be involved with clients. We still could get a trade to 1.38/1.39 in the Euro but my clients will be absent. They took a profit on their April calls today. If the Cable was to fill the gap from Sunday at 1.5232 we will likely get short for clients. They still hold June puts in the Yen and will try to navigate there as best as possible; we are looking for a trade to 1.10 in the coming weeks. Depending on how tight you ran stops you were likely stopped on your April crude shorts. We think a move lower is likely but prices may stay afloat if the dollar moves south. Clients still hold May put spreads. We advised clients who were not already involved in natural gas to buy June $5/5.50 call spreads or April futures. It may be contrarian but we still like selling rallies in the Indices; our vehicle of choice is the S&P and ES. Sugar traded 2.6% lower but the 200 day MA held. Clients are buying here expecting a trade back above 26 cents in May; current price 22.05. The 100 day MA has held for the last 2 session in 30-yr bonds at 116′24. We are looking to be a seller from higher levels for clients. Those more aggressive than me could buy and run stops under to 100 day MA. We expect sideways action in the grains in the coming sessions but would advise a small long position into next weeks USDA. If forced to pick just one we suggest corn. Live cattle traded back within 1/2 cent of its contract highs; we are sellers still with clients expecting 89.00 in April. April gold ticked slightly higher today, this allowed us to exit stage left. We advised clients to book their profits on all gold longs and move to the sidelines and wait for a set back to get re-positioned. May silver traded to its 100 day moving average but failed to penetrate. We advised our more conservative clients to book profits on their May positions and our more aggressive clients to roll their May out to July contracts. This allows them to take advantage of further upside but have time in case we get a correction. Risk Disclosure: The risk of loss in trading commodity futures and options can be substantial.

2010-03-03,"ALL THAT GLITTERS IS GOLD? (PHYS, GLD, NAV, IAU, GTU, CEF)","The buzz the past few trading days has been the issuance of a new gold closed-end mutual fund with some unique features—redemption (not spiritual), or the ability to take delivery of 400 ounce gold bars, and potential tax advantages. Toronto based Sprott Asset Management raised $400M in an IPO February 26, 2010 of Sprott Physical Gold Trust (NYSE:PHYS). On March 3rd, the fund will have cash from settlement and will start buying 400 ounce gold bars. It will do so through bullion dealers in Toronto and London. The gold purchased will be with nearly the full sum of proceeds and delivered as London Good Delivery to the Canadian Mint where it will be stored. As a closed-end fund investors can expect the PHYS to trade at a premium or discount to Net Asset Value (NYSE: NAV) at any time. Further fund management has indicated a desire to sell new shares periodically (they’d like to raise an additional $600M) as is typical of other closed-end funds. New share issues would be dilutive to existing holders causing shares to fall if only temporarily. This often leads to some short-term frustration since this often happens just when the NAV and premium for existing shares is rising. Demand must be strong in this case and fund management will take advantage of it which is a business decision. Also consistent with closed-end funds versus ETFs are higher fees. PHYS annual fee is .60% versus popular gold ETFs like SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) and iShares COMEX Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: IAU) with management fees of .40%. But, what separates PHYS from other products like Central Gold Trust(AMEX: GTU) and Central Fund Canada (AMEX: CEF) is the redemption feature plus perhaps certain tax advantages. The tax advantage per the prospectus states: “Any gains realized on the sale of units by an investor may be taxable as long-term capital gains (at a maximum rate of 15% under current law)”. This would then avoid the 28% tax on collectables also under current law. There may be circumstances where this can all change obviously. The redemption feature works as follows: An investor in the fund may take physical delivery of a minimum of one 400 ounce bar by contacting the fund on the 15th of each month outlining the details of the delivery request including number of bars and so forth. It’s up to the holder to make arrangements for delivery and this can be cumbersome. However, an investor may opt to arrange with Brinks or another armored car service to pick-up the gold and transfer it to another storage provider who will take and hold London Good Delivery bars. Currently this might cost $2500 per bar which isn’t that costly given prevailing value of a bar at around $450,000. Or, if you’re feeling man enough, you can pick bars up yourself and toss them in the trunk of your mini. Um, bring your shotgun. So what’s the big deal about redemption and taking delivery anyway? Because you can! This brings peace of mind to those with more extreme views who question the validity of assets backing various ETFs currently so popular. For example the COMEX has recently changed physical delivery previously customary for most commodity contracts. They might issue a certificate for an ETF like GLD in lieu of delivery. Other more extreme views prevail regarding this issue. Many, coin dealers and other vendors (“GOLD…Call Now!”), trash competitive products like current ETFs since they have coins to sell. They play to your fears of a financial Armageddon arguing you’ll need to hold the metal in your hand to buy bread. Also, given the financial roller-coaster infecting the global financial system, many fiduciaries are bound to insure clients and members that they have access to the “real deal”. Further, a 400 ounce bar cost is expensive precluding delivery for most retail investors making it an institutional investment. What conditions would need to exist for investors to take delivery? A financial Armageddon where gold prices are soaring not falling. In that case, the cumbersome nature of the redemption process is a small inconvenience. Aside from taking comfort in the integrity of what you own delivery is the ultimate attraction. Won’t all these gold issues affect gold prices? Not necessarily. However, supplies and new gold discoveries are lessening. There remains activity on both sides of the market. Many central banks, and the IMF recently, are selling but others (Russia, China & India) are buying. Clearly with an increasing supply of gold products such as PHYS available, gold has never been more in focus. The many gold products coming to market are an indication of discomfort with current market conditions and monetary policies. We welcome PHYS as another choice for investors.

2010-03-04,Designing the Perfect Gold ETF,"The recently-introduced Sprott Physical Gold Trust (PHYS) is getting a lot of attention from gold-oriented investors. My colleague Ron Rowland explained how PHYS is Not an ETF despite some superficial similarities. The conversation about PHYS often comes back to one central question: Can an investor be sure the gold represented by shares of the fund is really there? The quick answer is “No.” The process of securitizing gold – as with any other asset – depends on the integrity and cooperation of numerous parties. The chain can fall apart at any point if someone is dishonest or incompetent. Assorted safeguards exist to reduce this possibility, but they are not foolproof. This applies not only with PHYS but also products like SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), iShares Comex Gold Trust (IAU), and ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (SGOL). That being the case, investors who demand assurance they really own physical gold stored in their name in a secure place should probably not buy any of these gold-related securities. All are nothing more than book entries and pieces of paper that claim to represent the ownership of gold. If you don’t trust whoever is making this claim, don’t do business with them. Buy a good safe and keep your gold at home. Storing gold in your house isn’t risk-free either, of course. Burglary and robbery are always possible. You also won’t be able to buy and sell instantly, and your transaction costs will likely be higher than they are in the securities markets. It would be nice to have our cake and eat it too, but I don’t see how. So I throw out a question to you: How do we square this circle? What do you want to see in an exchange-traded gold product? What could sponsors like Sprott, ETFS, iShares, or SPDR do to meet your needs? Keep in mind there will always be trade-offs between expenses, liquidity, and security. The possibilities are also limited to what is legal. Maybe the law ought to be different – and would be different if guys like Ron Paul were in charge – but that’s a separate question. We have to play with the cards we are dealt. Add your ideas in the comments and maybe someone who can do something about it will pay attention.

2010-03-11,Where from here? 3/11/10 ,"Markets seem to waiting for some type of catalyst to determine the direction of the next leg. Inside day in Crude oil as prices hover around $82/barrel. For new entries we still like the idea of $5 put spreads but we would start looking at the June as opposed to May contract. If currently in the May we would try to buy back the bottom leg; we have suggested for clients to buy back their $70 puts and that would leave them long the $75 puts. A disappointing day for longs in natural gas as yesterday could prove to be just a head fake. Clients remain long via April futures and June call spreads as prices were off 2.4% today. As of this post indices are at the high of the day; we think we are close to an inflection point but we’ve been wrong for the past 2 weeks. If the S&P closes above 1148 exit short futures at a loss. Fourth consecutive down day in sugar but we are assuming yesterday’s low at 18.82 in May will serve as support. May cotton has lost 3.8% in the last 5 session and closed below the 20 day moving average for the first time since February 8th. We are expecting another 2-4 cents and will then be advising clients to lift shorts. Corn was flat on the day while wheat was a small loser and soybeans giving up almost 3%. A larger crop from South America could pressure soybeans another 30-50 cents. Clients are long July soybean meal and down but we are looking for prices to rebound within that time frame, we may average in next week. Additionally they own puts in May soybean oil and should be able to book a profit next week on a move under 39.00 in May. Trail stops down if you are short lean hogs; if the 9 day MA gives way we should see a trade under 70.00 cents in April. Mixed bag in metals; we are still anticipating a trade lower in gold, silver, and copper before we see any substantial upside. The Commodity currencies (Kiwi, Aussie, Loonie) look vulnerable; clients remain short the Loonie expecting a trade under .9500. Risk Disclosure: The risk of loss in trading commodity futures and options can be substantial. Past performance is no guarantee of future trading results.

2010-03-18,Is The SPDR Gold ETF The Reason Behind The Massive Rally In Gold?,"“Clusterstock’s Chart of the Day makes the case that gold ETFs like the massive SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) have helped push prices higher in recent years by letting speculators bet on the precious metal. This “trigger-finger investor base” could exacerbate a crash when the momentum fades, the argument goes,” John Spence Reports From MarketWatch. Spence goes on to say, “With more than $40 billion in assets, GLD is the second-largest U.S.-listed ETF behind SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Huge inflows and the rise in gold prices have resulted in the fund’s assets more than doubling from $18 billion in September 2008, according to J.P. Morgan. The ETF holds more gold than many sovereign nations have stashed in their reserves.” “ETFs have allowed speculative buyers to rapidly move in and out of the asset, which has changed the nature of the investor base driving the metal’s marginal price,” Business Insider writes. “See, the gold buyers of the past didn’t have the hair-trigger trading capability of the present ETF group, and there was a time when gold was considered simply a store of value rather than a vehicle for making huge upside,” it adds. “Which is why some research firms have voiced concern about gold’s suspected dependency on fund flows for price support.” We have listed some options for investing in gold through ETFs below: LONG: The investment (GLD) seeks to replicate the performance, net of expenses, of the price of gold bullion. The trust holds gold, and is expected to issue baskets in exchange for deposits of gold, and to distribute gold in connection with redemption of baskets. The gold held by the trust will only be sold on an as-needed basis to pay trust expenses, in the event the trust terminates and liquidates its assets, or as otherwise required by law or regulation. The investment (GDX) seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the AMEX Gold Miners index. The fund generally normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in common stocks and American depositary receipts (ADRs) of companies involved in the gold mining industry. The fund is nondiversified. The Funds (GDXJ) investment objective is to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners Index (the “Junior Gold Miners Index”). For a further description of the Junior Gold Miners Index, see “Junior Gold Miners Index.” The objective of (SGOL) the newly listed shares is to reflect the performance of the price of Gold bullion, less the Trust’s operating expenses. The Trust is open ended and is designed for investors who want a cost-effective(1) and convenient(2) way to invest in Gold as well as diversify their Gold holdings. The investment (UGL) will seek to replicate, net of expenses, twice the performance of gold bullion as measured by the U.S. Dollar p.m. fixing price for delivery in London. The fund normally invests assets in financial instruments with economic characteristics twice the return of the index. It may employ leveraged investment techniques in seeking its investment objective. The investment (DGL) seeks to track the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is a rules-based index composed of futures contracts on gold and is intended to reflect the performance of gold. The investment (DGP) seeks to replicate, net of expenses, twice the daily performance of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is intended to reflect changes in the market value of certain gold futures contracts and is comprised of a single unfunded gold futures contract. The objective (IAU) of the trust is for the value of its shares to reflect, at any given time, the price of gold owned by the trust at that time, less the trust’s expenses and liabilities. The trust is not actively managed. It receives gold deposited with it in exchange for the creation of baskets of iShares, sells gold as necessary to cover the trust’s liabilities, and delivers gold in exchange for baskets of iShares surrendered to it for redemption. The trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. SHORT: The investment (DZZ) seeks to replicate, net of expenses, twice the inverse of the daily performance of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is intended to reflect changes in the market value of certain gold futures contracts and is comprised of a single unfunded gold futures contract. The investment (GLL) will seek to replicate, net of expenses, twice the inverse daily performance of gold bullion as measured by the U.S. Dollar p.m. fixing price for delivery in London. The fund normally invests assets in financial instruments with economic characteristics inverse to the index. It may employ leveraged investment techniques in seeking its investment objective.

2010-03-18,Luck Of The Irish 3/17/10,"I have found that the harder I work and the more research I do the luckier I am. Crude is back near the recent highs having gained nearly $4 off yesterdays lows. The previous 2 attempts above $83 in the last week have failed will 3 times be a charm. We continue to advise clients to be a seller above $81 and a buyer near $77 given the opportunity. Clients hold puts in May contracts and are currently under water. Natural gas has lost its footing again today losing just over 1% as of this post. Clients are lightly long futures and hold June calls and are under water. Energies have not be kind to us of late but in time we think that will change. New highs in stocks today…DO NOT fight the Fed is the saying! The higher prices get on the indices the more room they have to fall. Now that the S&P is above 1150 could 1200 be challenged? We suggest getting out of the bulls way as for futures and will be advising buying more June puts on evidence of a top. Sugar traded below 18 cents/lb for the first time since July of 2009 today though prices settled almost 4% off its low. We want to see more evidence before picking a bottom as we’ve already tried unsuccessfully in recent weeks with clients. We expect further downside in cotton but as we’ve suggested we need to see a close below the 20 day moving average for confirmation; in May 80.85. OJ closed down for the third consecutive day but we want to see a trade closer to $1.30 before we would shop longs for clients. Let the debt market continue to work higher before establishing shorts. Both 30-yr bonds and notes were gainers today but we expect more to follow. If it grows in the ground most likely it was higher today; corn 2%, soybeans 1.5%, wheat 1.85%, oats even joined the party gaining 3.2%.Look for our specialty article on corn published today. Clients are long corn via futures and options thinking a move to $4.50 and beyond. If in fact Ag continues north clients will be advised to take off the May soybean oil at B/E or a slight loss. They own 40.00 puts and are intrinsic but prices have started to move up, gaining 1.17% today. Much like equities the higher cattle get the better sell opportunity I see in the futures, stand aside for now. Prices have gained 12% in the last 2 1/2 months and are in our opinion close to an interim peak…stay tuned. April gold was higher for most of the day but started to break lower in late dealings. We favor the sidelines or selling rallies still anticipating a trade below $1100. May silver remains stuck between $17.10(50% Fibonacci level) and $17.60 (38.2% Fibonacci level) with prices closing smack-dab in the middle. We have July call spreads on with clients but are looking for an exit door as we fear there is more downside risk than upside potential currently. We are right back to where we were 2 weeks ago in copper as prices were higher by 10 cents the last 2 days. We expect downside in the months to come; this is more of a long term trade. The dollar is below the trend line but failed to follow through to the downside. The Pound did rally as expected but the Euro did not…go figure. Our clients' Canadian dollar options have moved against them as we’ve yet to get pressure in energies and metals as we anticipated. That is why we played with June options and not futures. They are still alive to fight anther day. We feel it is still doable to see the Loonie come apart but a move down needs to develop from here or we will be cutting losses.

2010-03-22,Increased Global Demand Will Support The Price Of Gold ETFs,"“Gold prices over the past week have been teetering in positive, negative and somewhat uncertain territory. But there is confidence that the price of bullion will increase this year. One factor that is likely to support the price of the precious metal is the fact that central banks around the world have been hoarding the commodity and are reluctant to sell it. In fact, some bullion analysts expect the central banks of China, Russia and India to continue to gobble up gold as they move away from sovereign bonds and seek safer investments,” Kevin Grewal Reports From The Street. Grewal goes on to say, “A second factor likely to support the price of the yellow metal is the expected increase in global demand for base metals. There is an indirect correlation between the two types of metals, and in general as the prices of base metals increase so do those of gold. Thirdly, investor appetite for safe-haven tools is expected to continue to rise as sovereign debt issues in Europe, particularly Greece, continue to make headlines and remain a concern.” “Lastly, the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates at or near zero is likely to result in a loss of purchasing power, which could result in the U.S. dollar declining and make gold appealing to foreign investors and painting a macroeconomic backdrop which may support gold’s price,” Grewal Reports. We put together a list of some Gold ETFs to play if you believe in Golds increased global demand below: LONG: The investment (GLD) seeks to replicate the performance, net of expenses, of the price of gold bullion.

2010-03-25,Does Investing In The Platinum ETF Make More Sense Than A Gold ETF?,"“Gold might have history on its side, but when it comes to investing in precious metals platinum arguably makes more sense. Platinum is rarer, dearer and just as pretty. What’s more, unlike gold, it has an important industrial use in automotive catalytic converters and LCD TV screens. If that weren’t enough to recommend the white metal, the launch of new exchange-traded funds makes platinum easier than ever to buy and sell,” Christopher Helman Reports From Forbes. Helman goes on to say, “How does platinum compare to gold as an investment? It tends to trail its yellow sister when times are bad but outperform when industrial demand recovers. That’s been the case in the past three months, as platinum prices have outpaced gold’s by roughly 10 percentage points. These days, an ounce of platinum at $1,600 buys roughly 1.4 ounces of gold. That’s more than the average of 1.2 ounces last year, according to Bloomberg. Back in May 2008, an ounce of platinum bought 2.4 ounces of gold” “The ETF Securities Physical Platinum Shares (PPLT) fund is similar to the popular gold bullion SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) in that it buys and holds raw bullion (safeguarded by JP Morgan Chase (JPM)). Its shares track platinum’s spot price. You’ll incur lower transaction and storage fees in holding the ETF (annual expenses: 0.6%) than in holding and storing your own bullion bars,” Helman Reports. See more details to Helman’s story: HERE Platinum does have some appeal to it for different reasons but, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF is the second biggest ETF in the world for a reason.

2010-03-26,Further Political Disruptions Around The World Will Push Gold ETF Prices Higher,"“One of my favorite areas to invest in to protect my profits and reduce my portfolio risk is an ETF that invests in gold. SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) has advanced 150% during the past five years compared to an advance of just 1% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. And during the ugly bear market from October 9, 2007, until March 9, 2009, GLD was up 23.9% compared to the -56.8% drubbing that the S&P 500 took,” Roy Ward Reports From The Iconoclast Investor. Ward goes on to say, “Gold Shares provide investors with a convenient way to invest in gold. The shares trade on the NYSE and may be bought and sold like any other securities. I believe further political disruptions around the world will push gold prices higher in 2010 and 2011. Also, inflation will likely begin to rise within the next 12 months, which will also push gold prices higher. If the economy falters once again, investors will sell common stocks and invest in gold.” “Gold bullion increased from a low of 800 to almost 1,200 per ounce during 2009, but has now declined to 1,107 per ounce. The resulting lower price of GLD shares presents an outstanding investment opportunity. The purchase of (GLD) will counteract the volatility of common stocks and will guard against a possible fall in bond prices,” Ward Reports.

2010-03-28,"ETF Investors Will Look To Buy Gold And Tech As The Next Market Correction Nears (GLD, QQQQ, SPY, GDX)","I’m going to start off with a few breadth charts. The NYSE new highs – new lows chart is now on a sell signal as both the slow and fast average have rolled over and are accelerating downward. Everything continues to point to an impending correction. The change in character the last two days is also suggestive that something is different. Instead of opening lower and rising through the day, the market has been gapping up but closing lower. This is a complete about face from what has been happening over the last two months. I will be monitoring sentiment as the market moves down into the correction. If investors get scared and panic quickly then this should be a short correction. If we were to get a sharp selloff this is what I would expect to happen. I’m talking 50+ S&P 500 points in 3 or 4 days. If, however, investors have gotten locked into a buy the dip mentality it could slow the rate of decline and we might be looking at something lasting closer to 10 or more days. I will say that what usually happens after one of these extreme momentum moves is that everyone heads for the door at the same time. The correction tends to be scary but over quickly as everyone panics all at once. That’s what happened in February 2007 during the mini crash following the runaway move. The market gave back four months of gains in 8 days. Now I don’t think we are going to give back 4 months of gains (this is only a daily cycle low not an intermediate cycle low), but I do think we could quickly fill the March 5th gap, which would be a 60 point loss. If that happened in 5 or 6 days it should be enough to swing the bullish sentiment all the way back to the extreme negative side of the boat. The market desperately needs to reset sentiment by going through another mini profit taking period and the sharper the correction, the better. I’ve warned many times that the intermediate correction separating the second and third leg of the bull was only going to be a profit taking correction that would soon be recovered. However, and as expected, while we were going through the last correction I had multiple traders inform me that this was the onset of another deflationary collapse. Heck, I’m still seeing articles on the internet predicting another deflationary collapse any day now. Often these predictions of disaster are associated with some imaginary trend line dating back to the 1970’s or 1980’s. I’ve even seen one site that based their predictions of an impending bear market on a trend line originating in the 30’s. I have to ask, how many people from the 1930’s are still trading stocks and are there enough of them to really effect the markets? I have no earthly idea why a trend line starting back in the depression should have any significance at all to today’s market. Geez, some of the crazy stuff one sees in this business. It’s enough to make you wonder if common sense is dead. I must say after watching both the tech and real estate bubbles expand and listening to the irrational reasons analysts gave at the time for why they weren’t bubbles, I have to think common sense is becoming a rare commodity in this day and age. I’m going to let you in on a secret. Bull markets don’t end because of lines on a chart or Fibonacci retracements or anything technical related for that matter. Bull markets end when a fundamental shift occurs. They end when something breaks. In a secular bear market like we have been in since 2000 that fundamental shift almost invariably leads to a severe bear leg down in stocks and the onset of a recession…or worse. We saw the first leg of the secular bear begin in 2000 as the world realized tech stocks were ridiculously overpriced, along with Greenspan’s monetary policies spiking the price of oil. The end result was a severe bear market and a recession. We saw this again more recently as the credit and real estate bubbles burst. This was then exacerbated by Bernanke’s insane monetary response which, of course, did nothing to stop either one of those bubbles from bursting. All Bernanke’s monetary response did was spike the price of oil to $150 and made sure we would have a very severe recession. This is still a cyclical bull though and until we have a catalyst in place to kill it there is one game plan that should be followed. That game plan is one that everyone who has the slightest experience in the market should already know. In bull markets you BUY DIPs. And you continue buying dips until you see a fundamental change occur that is going to send us down into the next recession. So once we enter the correction (it may have started with last Thursday’s key reversal) we want to be buyers of that dip. (I’m going to outline a game plan in a minute). First off, let me state again that I seriously doubt the next leg down in the secular bear is going to come from a deflationary front. We’ve already gone down that road. Bernanke proved he can defeat deflation with his printing press. Heck, he proved he could abort a left translated four year cycle with the power of the printing press. I’m constantly getting into debates with traders pushing the deflation scenario. The fact remains that we had the worst deflationary period in 80 years and Bernanke halted it in 9 months. Bernanke halted deflation the same way Roosevelt halted deflation in the 30’s by debasing the currency. I can assure you that if the slightest hint of deflation reappears, Ben will crank up the presses again. So I just don’t see deflation as the catalyst for the end of this cyclical bull. The catalyst for the death of any bull market almost always comes from the area that is experiencing excesses. In 2000 the catalyst emerged when the tech sector cracked. Everyone had become convinced these companies were eventually going to make unimaginable amounts of money, while amazingly enough overlooking the fact that most of them were making no money and never really had any reasonable shot at ever making any money. They were just burning through capital and at an incredible rate. Once the world woke up and realized the emperor had no clothes, down we went. This collapse was exacerbated by Greenspan’s printing efforts to ward of the imagined 2000 contagion and had the unintended consequence of spiking the price of oil. The latest catalyst as I mentioned above came when the overheated real estate and credit markets imploded. So we have to ask ourselves, where is the excess this time? It certainly isn’t tech. The companies that are left are making money. It’s not the real estate markets. That bubble has already popped. And I don’t believe it is going to pop again. I doubt it’s going to come from the credit markets again, as people and banks are deleveraging now, and for years to come. Besides central banks have already figured out they can fix those problems by changing the accounting laws and by pumping liquidity. So where is the dam going to spring a leak from this time? What is the area that is experiencing massive excesses that will eventually come back to haunt us? I would say there are two. One of them is government debt. But I’m not sure that will cause problems though because governments control the printing presses. No matter how much debt they rack up they can always print enough additional money to pay it. That leads us to the heart of where I think the next catalyst is going to emerge. The one area of incredible excess is the currency markets. Let’s face it, every country in the world has been running the presses on overdrive since early 2008. This has created an ocean of liquidity covering the globe like no other time in history. It halted the deflationary spiral we were in last year. And it is certainly giving the illusion that good times are returning (heavy emphasis on illusion). But just like the credit bubble felt real nice while it was growing, there are going to be consequences for this excessive liquidity. The piper will eventually have to be paid. I expect it will start when a small or maybe even a medium sized country’s currency gets into trouble. Then, just as subprime infected the rest of the mortgage market, it will spread into other currencies. I strongly suspect the bull market will end when something breaks in the currency markets. So until we see that happen investors should continue to buy dips and ignore all the Chicken Little’s predicting the sky is falling because we are approaching a trend line from 1932 or because this is the third of a third wave or whatever hokey nonsense they imagine will start the next bear phase. As I have said, bear markets begin when the fundamentals break down, not when the technicals do. The Game Plan: Now with that in mind, and allowing that nothing in the currency markets has broken …yet, we need to plan for how we should proceed. At the moment traders should be mostly in cash as we await the correction into the daily cycle low. Once we get the inevitable correction we have a couple of options. One, we can invest heavily back into the miners on the assumption that gold’s A-wave has started. That will certainly be an option, but one with a very big condition attached to it. Gold must break below the February low. If gold doesn’t break below the February low of $1044 I think that option will come off the table. The reason being that the intermediate gold cycle is going to be short as we go into this stock market correction. Usually this cycle will last about 20-25 weeks. If the cycle bottoms next week or the week after that it would put the intermediate cycle at 14/15 weeks. Now it’s not unusual for gold to have a short cycle from time to time but if gold hasn’t made a lower low then we will be facing the distinct possibility that we are going to get another bounce that fails to make a higher high followed by a final move to lower lows that bottoms in the normal timing band. The other possibility would be that February did mark the D-wave bottom and gold is now in a very tricky A-wave advance. This is a possibility but one that is going to be very difficult to game as we won’t really have confirmation unless gold breaks above $1161. And by that time the rally will probably be mostly over as A-waves rarely make new highs. So while I know gold bugs will jump on a higher low as proof gold has bottomed, cyclically it would be much better if gold makes a lower low as that would have much higher odds of marking a true intermediate cycle low and probably the end of the D-wave. It would also be a huge plus if the COT report shows a 90+ Blees rating. (The Blees rating is simply a measure of how bullish or bearish commercial traders are compared to the last 18 months and available to subscribers in the weekend reports). That’s not going to happen with gold above $1050. The next thing I want to call attention to is Bernanke’s goal. It has always been his intent to inflate asset prices. And he’s certainly succeeded so far. Now let me state clearly that I’m not a believer in the whole gold manipulation conspiracy theory nonsense. If gold were really being manipulated successfully then explain to me how in the world it’s managed to rise from $250 to over $1200 an ounce. What I will concede is that the powers that be would probably prefer that gold didn’t rise. $1200 gold kind of makes a mockery of their phony CPI and PPI numbers. Now that doesn’t mean they can do anything about rising gold. A secular bull market is a secular bull market and nothing anyone does is going to stop that from running its course. What it does mean is that they are certainly not going to do anything to expedite the process. What the powers that be do want is for the stock market to rise. So I think we have to admit that if there is anything the government can do to help that process along they will, or at the very minimum they will certainly not do anything to hinder that from occurring. So the second investment option when we get close to the bottom of the impending daily cycle would be to just buy the market (probably tech as it’s been outperforming and will likely continue to do so). If the government wants the market going up then the lowest risk play would be to just take them at their word and go along for the ride. Buying the QQQQ’s (QQQQ) or the SPYDER’s (SPY) would be, by far, the safest play if gold has not made a lower low and even if gold has made a new low it would still be the safest bet, although probably not the most profitable as an A-wave advance in gold should send mining stocks rocketing higher and would likely double the percentage gains possible in the CUBE’s or SPYDER’s. So I will be watching gold as we move down into the stock market cycle low. If gold does not make a lower low like we want, then I think we are going to have to assume that we are going to see another failed rally that is unable to break the pattern of lower highs and that will roll over again. Any positions taken in miners or metals at that point will have to be short term positions. That doesn’t mean those positions won’t rally. Many could rally 15 -20% which would probably be bigger than the stock market but we would have to go into those positions knowing we will be exiting again soon and that the odds are that this is just another deceptive bounce in an ongoing D-wave and not the explosive move of an A-wave rally. If gold does fail to make a lower low I think the safer bet would be just to buy the market. -Written By Toby Connor From Gold Scents Gold Scents is focused primarily on the secular gold bull market.

2010-04-05,"Gold ETF News: After 30% Gain in Past Year, Where Next for Gold?","Jeffrey Nichols, Senior Economic Advisor to Rosland Capital, had the following commentary based on today’s market activity and the week ahead.From its recent low under $1,090 an ounce, gold has recovered lost ground, trading above $1,120 in past days. And while gold prices have appreciated nearly 30 percent from a year ago, gold remains below its all-time high of $1,227 reached in early December. The question of “Where next?” may rest in the following factors: The Euro: Will the Euro regain its lost favor, or will sovereign risk considerations push the European currency still lower against the U.S. dollar? In the recent past, capital flight and currency speculation gave the dollar a boost, and the “appearance” of a stronger dollar has been gold’s chief nemesis ever since Europe’s sovereign risk crisis moved to center stage. Greece’s announced “bail-out” plan in March eased sovereign-risk fears and gave gold some room to recover. But Europe’s currency crisis is far from over. Credit default markets are again signaling rising anxiety, not only over Greek debt but also over the sovereign debt of Portugal, Spain and Italy. In the near term, another run on the Euro could send gold lower. Federal debt: Rising anxiety over America’s huge federal debt (as evidenced by the mixed reception by foreign central banks and institutional investors to U.S. Treasury debt offerings in the past couple of months) is undermining faith in the U.S. dollar and calling into question its future purchasing power. As concerns about the dollar mount, as central banks and foreign investors demand a rising risk premium on U.S. Treasury debt offerings, the effect of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and uncertainty about the future viability of the continent’s common currency will have a diminishing effect on the dollar – and gold will be free to reflect its inherent value. Global demand: Will strong physical demand from China, India, and other important Asian gold markets continue to underpin the price, set an effective floor beneath the market, and limit downside risks? Physical demand from this region, particularly India and the Middle East, tends to be extremely price sensitive. In recent weeks, however, particularly as gold dipped toward $1,090 an ounce, increased buying from the region (China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Arabian Gulf states), provided strong support and helped push the price back above $1,100. Significant and substantial growth in gold demand from this region pushed by a range of factors will have a very positive effect on the dollar price of gold – something Western investors have come to anticipate. Western investment: Investors are returning to gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after several months of lackluster interest. Bullion held on behalf of the 12 gold ETFs we monitor, rose by 929,373 ounces in March, recording the first monthly gain since last November. In contrast, gold ETFs saw net sales of 825,501 ounces in the first two months of this year. In addition, demand for gold bullion coins has also picked up in recent weeks, indicating that interest in gold from individual “retail” investors is also perking up. As all of these developments coalesce positively for gold, we are still confident in our forecast of $1,500 gold by the end of 2010.

2010-04-07,Swimming Against The Tide 4/6/10,"Some of our more contrarian plays look to be turning in our clients favor. Oil is higher for the fourth consecutive day as prices inch closer to $90/barrel. A higher high and higher low today for natural gas giving back most of its gains from yesterday’s session. We see support at the 9 day MA in May just above $4. We are suggesting a light long position in May futures and July 50 cent call spreads. Indices higher once again though volumes remain light. We continue to feel a day of reckoning will come but jumping in front of this runaway train is ill advised. Wait for confirmation of a top on futures. The only viable play we see is a small put option position in ESM10 (mini S&P puts). May OJ futures traded below $1.30 today for the first time in 2010; getting close to shopping longs for clients. Green across the board in agriculture; rice and wheat being the stand-outs with rice gaining 2.50% and wheat just over 2%. Clients were advised to exit their December KCBOT/CBOT wheat spreads today at even money; a profit of approximately $400/per. We are suggesting long calls in July corn and long futures in December. Mixed bag in metals with gold slightly higher with silver and copper slightly lower. The 100 day MA comes in at $1122 in June gold with upside resistance at $1140 and then $1157. Inside day in May silver; use $17.80 as support and $18.50 as resistance. Nothing new to report in forex. The Loonie traded at par today for the first time since the summer of 08′. Clients are short via puts and down considerably; thankfully they have some time. The RBA raised rates 0.25% to 4.25%.

2010-04-26,Weighing Risk Vs. Reward 4/26/10,"After 8 days of rest and relaxation we are back at it trying to figure out the best risk/reward scenarios in the commodities market. It is vital in our opinion to evaluate both before establishing positions as many commodity traders just look at the reward side of the equation. After approaching $86 in early dealings Crude was off for the first time in three sessions losing just over $1. For aggressive traders we are advising buying dips as long as the $83 level holds in June futures. On a spike higher in RBOB and heating oil in the coming sessions we would advise exiting longs or at least halving your position. We had hoped for more follow thru in natural gas today after the strong close to end out last week. Prices remain at the upper end of the recent trading range but as we continue positioning our clients to take advantage of higher ground. We suggest long futures trailing stops in June and will start pricing out July-September options. New highs were rejected in indices across the board. This is likely due to profit taking ahead of the 2 day FOMC meeting. As we posted in our weekly commentary this morning we would need to see settlements below the 20 day MA’s to feel confident an interim top has formed. Inside day in sugar; it may be premature to re-establish plays in sugar until a bottom is confirmed. We are pricing out spreads on futures but have yet to commit any client capital…stay tuned. July OJ was unchanged on today’s session; on a trade above $1.40 our objective for clients should be reached at a 15-20% profit on their July options. We started initiating longs for clients in coffee today; they bought September 15 cent call spreads to play a bounce in the coming weeks. Though clients have no exposure aggressive traders could continue to sell rallies in the Treasury complex (10-yr notes/30-yr bonds) with stops above the recent highs. On a breach of the 20 day MA in Euro-dollars look for more selling pressure. Clients were advised to lift their May short corn hedges today as the LTD is April 30. Those still seeking protection we advised to place sell stops below the recent lows in July against their December longs. Clients were advised to take any longs off in soybeans and soybean meal as prices are starting to look toppy. We are suggesting selling rallies in wheat but would prefer to be a seller of KCBOT or CBOT closer to $5 on the July contract…stay tuned. Cancel any orders to short cattle at the moment as prices may grind higher, we should have some trading suggestions in the coming days. We’ve yet to make a move for clients but we may buy the 84/80 put spread in June lean hogs the next few days if they can pay $400. Uneventful day in metals with gold slightly lower and silver slightly higher. Clients have NO exposure long or short gold/silver currently. We expect to see a correction of 75 cent s-$1 in silver and $40-60 before we have an interest in longs. Clients continue to sell rallies in the Cable and Loonie expecting breaks lower. We would not recommend trading without stops to limit losses, if prices turn south our objectives are 1.5200 and .9825 in the June contracts.

2010-05-03,Monitor Relationships 5/3/10,"Base and precious metals no longer appear to be correlated, Treasuries' inverse relationship to indices no longer exists, dollar up equals commodities down right…wrong. When things do not make sense take your position size down. Mixed results in Crude today with the front month lower and back months gaining. Take for instance just the first 2 months. At the beginning of April this spread was at a 25 cent discount and today it is approaching a $3.00 discount. We got the trade over $87 in June we were looking for but without a new contract high over $87.59 in the coming sessions we expect a set back. We are still advising energy traders to use the most recent spike higher in prices in the distillates to take off longs. Last weeks lows have held so far in natural gas as prices picked up nearly 2% today. We’ve yet to make a move but for the right price in the coming sessions we like buying clients August and September call spreads. Contact us for more precise details. Inside day in the indices but the bounce back is impressive. Continue to use the 20 day MA on the daily charts as your pivot point. We’ve been anticipating a correction like most but it has yet to materialize. Coffee was higher by 2.4% today lifting prices back to the 100 day MA. On a trade above $1.40 in September clients should hit their profit orders…check back tomorrow as today’s settlements should come in about $100 less than their limit. Not yet but at some point this week clients will likely be buyers of October 10′ and March 11′ sugar…stay tuned. Euro-dollars were off nicely today; aggressive traders could be short futures with stops above the recent highs. Clients will be using this rally in Treasuries to get short futures…stay tuned. Clients are long June 30-yr bond puts expecting a trade closer to 116′00 in the coming weeks. Agriculture was in the red today with soybeans and soy meal suffering the most. Expect to buy this correction but from lower levels; closer to $265 in July soy meal and $9.40 in July soybeans. June live cattle traded higher for the third session today back near 96 cents. We may not get the correction anticipated in cattle so we need to go back to the drawing board…stay tuned. If hogs fail to rally tomorrow we will most likely be adding to shorts for clients. We’re still thinking the gap in the charts about a nickel lower needs to be filled. Gold traded to fresh highs but it just does not smell right so we advised clients to liquidate their long future and options at a small profit and move to the sidelines for the next 24-48 hours. We are still waiting for a correction in silver to get clients positioned long. We missed the most recent correction and seem to be reminded of it every day. That is not necessary and we should be there next time. Copper broke the 100 day MA today and has given up over 30 cents in the last month; clients remain short looking for more. We advised clients to take a profit on their Pound shorts today around 1.5250. We expect currencies to trade off the dollar this week; a close above 82.50 expect more upside and on a close below 82.00 expect more downside. The RBA should raise IR 0.25% tomorrow so trade accordingly. Risk Disclosure: The risk of loss in trading commodity futures and options can be substantial.

2010-05-11,Gold Beats December 3 Record Peak High As Rally In Higher Risk Assets Loses Heat,"The risk-averse investors are scurrying back to gold as optimism over EU’s $1 trillion bail-out package waned just one day after it was announced. As a result, the yellow metal has hit its highest level since December 3. Gold futures for June delivery added as much as $20.70, or 1.72%, to $1,221.50 an ounce by 10:24 am. Analyst Daniel Major of RBS Global Banking & Markets said, “Investors are trying to search out safe havens, and clearly gold is one of those. While the current environment of acute investor risk aversion remains, gold is bound to benefit. On Monday, the higher risk assets such as the euro, stocks and industrial commodities witnessed a relief rally, while gold slipped 2%, only to make a comeback today while the rally in other assets fizzled out. According to Steve Chun, a trader with Hyundai Futures Company in Seoul, “Gold remains in favor as investors haven’t regained full confidence that Greece and debt-ridden countries will survive with the package. China’s higher inflation is also adding to alternative demand for gold.” Some of the gold ETFs that are on the move today are SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), which is up 1.60%, iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), which has moved up 1.73%, and Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which has jumped 5.72%.

2010-05-14,"May 14, 2010: Time For A Permanent Portfolio Using ETFs?","With investors held hostage to government whimsy both here and abroad, coupled with the vagaries of trying to game the market only to be disappointed time and again with one's best laid investment plans going haywire, it may be time to structure a Permanent Portfolio with wealth that is both precious and essential to your long term expectations.The Permanent Portfolio concept was explained to the average investor in the 1970's by the late Harry Browne. Having a Speculative Portfolio for making educated guesses on the market and a Permanent Portfolio, designed to hold long term investments theoretically assembled to account for the unexpected while producing tangible gains is a seasoned idea which at present merits your consideration.Inspired by Browne and the steady success of his portfolio successor Michael Cuggino, here is a proposal to construct a Permanent Portfolio on your own, using Exchange Traded Funds.The premise is to have five categories of investment which will rise or fall independently.This portfolio should be rebalanced every six months to retain the ratio of one category to the others. The goal is to have the portfolio retain absolute value and rise approximately 2% better than the Citigroup 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill Index annually.Precious metals: 25%iShares Comex Gold Trust ETF (IAU)15%iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV)5%First Trust Global Platinum Index ETF (PLTM)5%Swiss Franc Assets: 10%Currency Shares Swiss Franc Trust ETF (FXF) 5%iShares MSCI Switzerland Index ETF (EWL) 5%Worldwide Real Estate and Natural Resources: 20%iShares North America Natural Resource Index ETF (IGE) 5%Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) 5%iShares FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed World Real Estate ex-U.S. ETF (IFGL)5%Vanguard REIT ETF(VNQ) 5%Agressive Growth Stocks: 15%iShares Morningstar Small Company Growth Index Fund ETF (JKK)10%ProShares Credit Suisse 130/30 ETF (CSM)5%U.S. Treasury Bills, Bonds and Other Dollar Assets: 30%Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)10%Vanguard Short Term Government Bond ETF (VGSH) 10%Vanguard Intermediate Term Government Bond ETF (VGIT) 10%I have attempted to propose ETFs from established companies that are actively traded (the Swiss Franc ETF excepted) and have low transaction costs and management fees. The percentage allocations to ETF's within a category is not a mandate.Permanent Portfolio purists have generally invested in gold and silver coins and bars rather than through funds, have used Swiss Confederation Bonds as SF currency and have laddered U.S. government obligations individually.THE AUTHOR HAS NO POSITIONS IN THE ABOVE SECURITIES AT THIS TIME."
2010-05-24,Markets Settle In 5/24/10,"The markets have relaxed but as investors you must not. There will be wild gyrations in the weeks to come so start thinking long and hard about how you want to be positioned. At the moment, $69 appears to be the line in the sand on front month Crude oil; July as of this post is at $70.20. Aggressive traders could buy futures with stops below the recent lows. We prefer to be buyers of August and September $5 bull call spreads for our clients. On the August contract, we expect to see a trade over $78/barrel in the coming weeks. We have started to advise clients looking to capitalize on movements in the distillates to get long; if our analysis is correct in Crude we should see a bounce of 20-25 cents in heating oil and 15-20 cents in RBOB. As for natural gas, it is not high on our list but traders wishing for exposure should continue to trade the 40-50 cent range. Continue to sell rallies in the indices; our downside targets are 1050 and ultimately 1000 in the S&P, 9600 in the Dow and 1710 in the NASDAQ. This could be a bumpy ride and we may see a rally back to the 100 day MA before the next leg lower. This comes in at 1135 in the S&P, 10545 in the Dow and 1895 in the NASDAQ. Cocoa closed above the 9 day MA today for the first time in two weeks; expect bullish trade recommendations in the days to come. Another 2-4% correction in sugar and we will start getting clients long October 10′ and March 11′ contracts. We likely will be sellers of cotton this week for clients so stay tuned. OJ closed lower today for the first time in eight sessions; could this be the beginning of the correction we’ve been calling for? We’re pricing out bearish play in Treasuries with futures and options but as of yet we’ve yet to price out a viable play. Based on the last two sessions we want to be selling rallies for clients but have yet to decide on a futures or options strategy…stay tuned. The short end of the curve remains a sell as we’re advising clients to buy long dated puts or to sell futures. It appears the market is starting to price in higher interest rates. We will be looking to unwind the remainder of client’s short August lean hogs on a drop of 1.50-2.50%. Gold traded higher for the first time in eight sessions gaining virtually $20/ounce on the session. We see light support at $1170 in June but have yet to establish any positions for clients until we get further proof that the recent 6.5% correction has run its course. July silver was higher by 1.90% on the day but has yet to take out previous support which is now acting as resistance at $18/ounce. Needless to say, we’ve advised clients to start working lightly long again via July futures or September $1.50-$2.00 call spreads. In Agriculture we suggest longs in September and December corn, November soybeans and December soy meal; for specifics contact us. The US dollar and Euro will likely set the tone this week as other crosses look for guidance. At the moment clients only exposure is longs in the Pound via July options.

2010-06-08,"Gold Hits Record Highs (GLD, IAU, SGOL)","Gold's currently most active contract, August delivery, rose $4.80 (0.4%) today. This may not sound like big news, until you see its actual price: $1,245.60 per ounce, an all-time high. The previous high was $1,243.10. In times of uncertainty, gold has long been a safe haven. And uncertainty doesn't even begin to describe this market. Consider the VIX, which tracks the volatility of the S&P 500. As recently as April 8, only two months ago, the index was at 16.48. After hitting highs of 45.79 on May 20, it remains at a high value of 36.57 as of June 7. Investors are celebrating as the market rises 3% one day and then panics into a 4% fall the next. While the markets have been trading relatively sideways for a few days, people are still on edge about deficits, jobs and currencies. That's where the precious metals trade comes in -- and here gold is king. In an interview with Larry Williams on the Benzinga podcast, the commodities trader sounded a similar note on precious metals and other commodities. He loves the volatility, as it gives him an opportunity to make money no matter what way the market turns. Even so, not everyone wants to jump into the commodities market. But they can still play the gold trade with exchange traded funds. The most popular is probably streetTRACKS Gold Shares ETF (NYSE: GLD). But others such as iShares COMEX Gold Trust Fund (NYSE: IAU) or ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF (SGOL) offer a similar play."
2010-06-09,"Larry Williams Warns Benzinga Users on FOREX (GOOG, GLD, IAU)","In an interview on the Benzinga podcast, famed commodities trader Larry Williams warned of trouble in the foreign exchange market. When discussing how he would handle financial regulation, he said, I would go to the people that I really respect in the industry and ask, 'Who are the bad guys?' They know who they are. I know who the bad guys in the commodities business are. You don’t have to write all these regulations you just find out who the bad guys are and go after them. But that’s not how government works. It’s all a bandage after everything happens. I can see right now where some things are going to happen. I use to work for some of those people but maybe now they’ll get their financial education and get burned. When asked where those bad things were going to happen, Larry responded definitively, Well, I think the Forex market is an opportunity for disaster. People have been told that it’s free commission and it’s not. I trade the same thing on the globex for a few bucks and they’re paying 30-40 dollars for the same trade. It just strikes me as unfair to the public. Larry also discussed why he preferred to trade in actual commodities rather than ETFs that track or are backed by them, such as GLD (NYSE: GLD) and IAU (NYSE: IAU). He said that he wanted to deal with the principal, not the agent. He noted the inherent benefit of owning commodities as something people need, frankly explaining that while you can go your whole life without a share of Google, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), people have a need for corn, soybean, oil, gold, etc. Check out the rest of Benzinga's exclusive interview with Larry Williams here.

2010-06-16,IAU Split Reveals iShares Exasperation,"When ETF investors think about gold, the first ticker that springs to mind is GLD – the SPDR Gold Trust. This is a source of great annoyance to iShares. They would much prefer that you buy their near-identical iShares COMEX Gold Trust (IAU), which is a distant runner-up in the asset race. In fact, it’s barely even a race. GLD currently has about $38 billion worth of gold in storage, while IAU only has about $3.3 billion. Other players like ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (SGOL) are even further behind. We see here a good example of first-mover advantage in ETF marketing. GLD came out in November 2004, and as the first such product made quite a media splash at the time. IAU came along a few months later, but by then the ticker GLD was firmly imprinted in trader’s minds. It doesn’t hurt that the letters G-L-D spring to mind a lot faster than I-A-U when you want to buy G-O-L-D. While iShares is still the leader in overall ETF assets, new owners BlackRock apparently want to dominate each individual segment as well. To that end, the firm recently announced a 10-for-1 split in IAU shares. The split will be effective after the close on June 21, 2010. As in stocks, ETF share splits do nothing to directly increase the value of your investment. Instead of owning one $120 share, you will have ten $12 shares. So why is iShares doing it? The lower price may enhance liquidity, since smaller players will be able to take advantage of the creation/redemption mechanism. On the other hand, large investors who typically pay trading commissions at a per-share rate will actually be encouraged to abandon IAU for GLD – which will still have a share price in the $120 range. Maybe I am missing something here, but to me it looks like iShares is flailing. Someone at the top is annoyed to be so far behind SPDR in this asset class, and they can’t figure out any other ways to distinguish their offering. The supreme irony is that if the split does somehow help IAU attract assets, SPDR can simply execute the same kind of split in GLD. Disclosure covering writer, editor, and publisher: Long GLD.

2010-06-24,ETFs That Dropped On Wednesday,"iShares MSCI Turkey Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: TUR), which fell 2.2%, was the worst decliner yesterday. The political tensions between Turkey and Israel pressurized TUR and the iShares MSCI Israel Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: EIS). These two funds are likely to remain volatile till the strife between the nations ends. ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) plunged 2.1%. Precious metals lost ground in the volatile trading session yesterday, while the industrial precious metals that are the most volatile dipped the most. PALL has tried hard this week to advance beyond its 50-day moving average. Investors may watch this level closely in the near future. Other ETFs that plummeted yesterday include iShares MSCI Australia Index Fund (NYSE: EWA) and United States Oil Fund (NYSE: USO), both of which declined 1.5% each. iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), which tracks gold, slipped a minor 0.6%.

2010-07-09,Is There Anything to the 18 Year Theory?,"Yesterday there was an article on Seeking Alpha with a fantastic title; With 3, 5, and 10 Year Stock Returns Negative, Why Are Pension Funds Assuming 8% Returns? I tweeted because they have to.A chart of the US stock market for last 100 years shows that for big chunks of time the market goes up a lot and then there are big chunks of time where it takes a very bumpy ride to nowhere.For people who don't want to be very active with their investing but who take the time to develop a basic understanding of this the task can be made a little easier. Some people like to hone in on these cycles lasting 18 years and while that might be a little simplistic going forward the nature of the past cycles combined with the current fundamental backdrop argues for more bumpy round trip to nowhere trading for a few years.The chart comes from Cam Hui who writes the Humble Student of the Market blog. I have unyielding faith there will be some sort of repeat of what the market did from 1944 until 1962 and then again from 1982 until 2000. Maybe it will start in 2018 and maybe it won't be as much is those two other periods but something similar will come.The ideal way to navigate this would be some sort of strategy that deemphasizes equities in a period like 1966-1982. This could mean relatively heavy doses of ETFs like iShares COMEX Gold Trust (IAU), inflation protected products like the SPDR Barclays TIPS ETF (IPE) if things look inflationary or regular bond funds like the iShares Barclays 10-20 Year Treasury Bond Fund (TLH) in an environment that appears to be deflationary, like now. In addition to that some sort of absolute return product like the IndexIQ Hedge Macro Tracker ETF (MCRO). The big idea is to protect assets in an environment where equities do not do well.Then after 18 years one would ideally rotate into some sort of aggressive equity exposure to capture a likely five-bagger, or more, in the market.I use the word ideal because perfect execution would require perfect information and that is of course unlikely. This could be partially mitigated by simply reducing equity exposure after 15-20 years of raging bull market as opposed to eliminating it. Something like the PowerShares Buy Write Portfolio (PBP) which some clients own could be one way to do this. I would also add that after 15-20 years of bumpy round trip to nowhere anyone on this sort of path should start increasing equity exposure.This is a vague but evolving thought but I believe it is best suited to people who are willing to spend only some time on their investments as opposed to no time or a lot of time. As I have pointed out numerous times despite the fact that the S&P 500 was down 24% price-wise in the recently ended decade many easily accessible countries thrived. Mexico was up 345%, Brazil up 301%, India up 243%, Norway up 121% and Israel up 109% as some examples.This is not to say that those countries will continue to perform like that if the cycle continues in the US until 2018 but some countries will (maybe those, maybe others) and for people willing to do a lot of work the notion of hiding as outlined above becomes less relevant.The relevance of the first line of the post is that as a do it yourselfer, if you save properly make the access a lot easier. , you are better positioned to take what the market gives. Many pensions obviously were not able to average 8% per year in the last decade and some did far worse by chasing heat or putting too much in private investments that blew up. If markets can recover from the Great Depression it can recover from the current event. The only variable will be time. You can hide out, which is perfectly valid, or you can take the time to find healthier countries to own and obviously ETFs."
2010-07-19,Let the Trade Work 7/19/10,"If you do the necessary research before putting on a trade “let the trade work.” By that I mean with the current volatility it is easy to get shaken out of good trades but if your timing is less than perfect but the risk/reward is favorable, stay in the trade. Aggressive traders could buy Crude with stops below the recent lows or purchase October $5 bull call spreads. At the most in the short run we see a set back to $73-74 with the upside potential eyed at $79-80. A bullish flag and pennant formation may be forming in the daily natural gas chart…time will tell. Clients have been advised to buy October 50 cent call spreads. The down sloping trend line that was breached last week in the indices capped the rally today. We will continue to sell rallies and have advised clients to purchase September puts. We expect to see 1015 in the S&P and 9700 in the Dow in the coming weeks. The trader that took delivery in the cocoa market may have had second thoughts today after the 5.81% decline. September futures closed back below the 100 day MA and we think there could be more downside to come. On a set back that holds 2800, we may have some long ideas…stay tuned. We suggest using any positive action to book profits on remaining sugar longs as we feel prices have gotten ahead of themselves. We would use a 3-4% rally in December cotton as a selling opportunity. If Treasuries are unable to rally in the coming days aggressive traders could get short 30-yr bonds and/or 10-yr notes with tight stops. Some of our clients profit orders were hit on their December cattle today; others have gtc orders working and need a slightly higher trade. Gold will close lower on the day but the 100 day MA did hold at least today. Aggressive traders could buy with stops below that level; in August at $1178. September silver lost 1% today trading to a six week low. We see support in September at the 50% Fibonacci level at $17.30 followed by the 61.8% at $16.75. Aggressive traders could buy dips but recognize you’re catching a falling knife. The pullback we forecast in Agriculture commenced today; while we expect more downside in the short run we suggest using the setback in corn, soybeans, and soy meal as a buying opportunity. We’re undecided in wheat at the moment but should have some trade ideas in the coming sessions. Clients remain positioned short the Euro via options and the Swissie via futures and options. As we’ve said in previous blogs our targets are 1.2450 and .9200 respectively. Risk Disclosure: The risk of loss in trading commodity futures and options can be substantial.

2010-07-28,Weakness in Commodities 7/27/10,"Weakness in commodities what to do? Here are a few ideas…get short, exit longs or be prepared to buy from lower levels. We think Crude oil and the distillates have put an interim top and expect prices to fall back. We reserve the right to change our mind if September closes above $79.50. We expect a $3 pullback in Crude and 10-15 cents in the distillates and then we would re-evaluate where from there. Exit ALL remaining longs. In terms of an allocation in this sector we prefer bullish exposure in natural gas via October and November 50 cent call spreads. As of the action today prices appear to be breaking the down sloping trend line previously mentioned. The next hurdle will be a settlement above the 50 day MA; at $4.57 in September. As of this post indices are slightly higher but the bulls seem to be running out of gas. On a further appreciation of 1.5-2.5% clients will exit their August ES 1150 calls and buy back their September ES 1000 puts. We cannot rule out a probe of 1130/1135 but we do not feel those levels are sustainable. Was a top made in sugar today? We’ve been calling a top for the last week and exited clients long perhaps a little premature. Prices in October closed 3.4% off their highs today. If this is the start of a correction we think a trade back to 16/16.50 happens quickly. Treasuries broke their 20 day MA with 30-yr bonds and 10-yr notes destined for lower ground. IF we can turn a profit on our clients Euro and Swissie shorts we would like to be in NOB spreads expecting September 30-yr bonds to track back to 122/123. Metal traders fled for the exit doors today with August gold breaking nearly 2% dragging prices to three month lows. We think the 200 day MA will be in play in the coming sessions at $1147. How prices respond there will determine movement in the next two weeks. Clients would be content buying from lower levels. September silver was lower by 4% today; we would exit futures and/or tighten stops as a close below the 200 day MA may mean lower ground. Traders holding December call spreads are losing money but once this correction concludes we may buy back their top legs. Nothing has changed with our year end target as we still anticipate a trade to $20/21 ounce. Copper failed again to take out the 100 day MA; if prices fade from here then prices should head south. If corn trades 2-3% lower in the remainder of the week we suggest buying December and covering all remaining shorts in September. Additionally we still feel November soybeans and December soy meal are buys but from lower ground; $9.40 and $270 respectively. Some clients remain short the Euro which is unchanged as of this post and short the Swissie which is down by just over 1%. Our targets remain $1.25 and .9200. If energies and metals continue to depreciate we may have some bearish suggestions in the Loonie. A failed rally today has prices looking like we could get a correction back to .9400.

2010-07-30,Goodbye July 7/30/10 ,"Based on the last two day’s action Crude oil appears to be making attempts at higher ground. We will be late to this move because I do not trust it and need further confirmation before getting bullish exposure for clients. A settlement above $79.50 would be the first hurdle. Natural gas will close 8% higher this week at a fresh one month high. We’re suggesting trailing stops on futures just below the 50 day MA and to purchase October and November 50 cent call spreads. The Dow bounced off the 200 day MA at 10275 and could revisit the week’s highs early next week closer to 10550. We would still suggest selling rallies thinking a weak jobs number next week could be the nail in the coffin for the bulls. Likewise the S&P pared losses today but as long as prices settle below 1104; the 200 day MA we think it remains a sell rallies market. For now clients will be fading rallies and purchasing September puts in the ES. December cotton closed 2.41% higher today breaking to the upside; futures traders should take losses on a trade above 80 cents. Yes we’re bucking the recent trend but we like December puts thinking a trade down to the low 70′s is likely. Lumber seems to have found some support between $200-205; as we’ve voiced in recent weeks we expect a jump to $240 in the November contract. December live cattle held the 20 day MA after multiple attempts re-gaining much of yesterday’s losses today. We want to be a buyer on a set back with clients closer to 93/94 cents. December gold gained 1.14% today lifting prices to the 100 day MA at the high of the day. Seasonally we are heading into a bullish part of the year for gold but we will wait for further evidence before re-committing capital for clients. Consecutive settlements above $1187 would get us interested in gaining long exposure…stay tuned. September silver was higher by 2.37% today lifting prices back over $18/ounce. Brave traders have remained long and should continue to trail stops on their futures. We also suggest buying December call spreads as a settlement over $18.25 next week should mean an attempt at $19.50. Buy agriculture before the 8/12 USDA report. Contact us for more details or subscribe to our weekly commentary for precise trading ideas. We’re interested in having client’s long corn, soybeans, soy meal and today started buying KCBOT/CBOT wheat spreads. Clients took a partial loss on their Swissie futures overnight. Most still are short but have reduced their trade size in half. Options traders remain short the Euro and Swissie looking for some reprieve next week. With the Central banks on a new monthly calendar we expect European currencies to depreciate...stay tuned.

2010-08-03,New Month…New Opportunities 8/2/10,"In the last three days Crude oil has advanced nearly 6% lifting prices back above the 100 day MA. We missed this most recent move with clients and being we only see an additional $2-4 upside we would not suggest getting on the train at these levels. Pullbacks should find buyers between $79.50-80.00 in the September contract. Natural gas had some trouble getting thru the $5 level with prices correcting back to the 50 day MA today losing just over 4%. We suggest keeping your stops on futures just below that MA. For fresh option entries we would be buying November 50 cent call spreads. On a move above today’s highs we would also suggest moving your October option positions out to November. I do not trust the up move in indices but as I said to a client today that and a nickel will get you a piece of gum. Indices are above the 200 day MA and until we get back below those levels the bulls are in the driver’s seat. Aggressive clients will fade rallies in the S&P as long as prices remain below 1135 in September. Some clients hold September Es puts expecting 1000-1025 into the fall. At the moment they are down on the trade with the last two day’s activity. We see the next upside resistance in the Dow just above 10800 and in the S&P at 1135-1140. Bearish engulfing candle in October sugar today with prices closing 0.90% lower. We anticipate a trade back to 17 cents in the next few weeks. December cotton failed to get above 80 cents today; aggressive traders could short futures with tight stops or buy December put options. December coffee closed nearly 5% off its highs; is an interim top finally in? Lumber is back above the 50 day MA; we expect a gain of 10% in the coming weeks. We expect to see a pull back in lean hogs, live cattle and feeder cattle but at the moment do not have any exposure with clients. Pork bellies which we rarely trade are trading at an all time high, brace your self for higher bacon prices. Tomorrow the test will be if gold can close above the 100 day MA; in December at $1187. One would think with outside market influence today gold would’ve seen better performance. When markets should move higher and they do not that generally means they will move lower…stay tuned. September silver gained 2% today solidly above the 50 and 100 day MA’s. Those levels which had previously served as resistance now will act as support. We suggest moving trailing stops up from $17.40 to $17.80 on futures. Continue to buy December call spreads as this leg could lift prices back near $19.50. We suggest booking profits on agriculture longs as a correction appears to have begun today. That means take profits in corn, soybeans, soy meal and wheat and look to re-enter longs on a set back and be positioned long ahead of the 8/12 USDA. We do not expect prices to get back to the levels from one month ago but after a 12-40% appreciation even bull markets need a rest. The dollar index broke the 200 day MA today but we think we’re over due for a “dead cat” bounce. Clients cut losses on all their futures in the Swiss franc today; this one stung as clients ended up losing just over $3,000 per contract including all hedges and fees. Option traders remain in puts in the Swissie and Euro currently carrying a loss. We cannot seem to figure out the currency market at the moment so we will refrain from new recommendations until we get a clearer picture, perhaps three Central bank meetings this week will shed some light?

2010-08-10,"Joe Terranova Is Bullish On Gold (GDX, GDXJ, IAU, GLD)","Joe Terranova said on CNBC's Fast Money that he doesn't have enough gold in his portfolio, and that is why he stepped out and bought some today. He believes that Fed is monetizing the debt, and owning gold is the ideal hedge in this situation. Joe Terranova noted that September and October have historically been weak for U.S. dollar, and that correlates with higher gold prices. He thinks that gold will be challenged at $1,265 and it will end the year at $1,300. If you are interested in gold you can take a look at iShares COMEX Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: IAU), SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ)."
2010-08-11,Fed Speak 8/10/10 ,"No change in rates but buying Treasuries is a new wrinkle and does not sound like an exit strategy to me?? Sounds like robbing Peter to pay Paul. September Crude should close below the 100 day MA for the first time in seven sessions. The next down side hurdle will be the trend line that has held since the July lows. We expect another $3-4 on this leg down and would suggest traders to take profits on any shorts and potentially reversing near $76. As long as Crude continues south the distillates should follow; continue to trail stops on any shorts as a trade below $2.00 if obtained likely would not last for long. Clients were advised to buy back their top leg on their October natural gas call spreads opening up the trade in case we rally from here. We’re thinking the same support that has held for the past six months should support near the current levels. Past performance is not indicative of future results. What I do like is the volume spike yesterday which could prove to be an interim reversal low…stay tuned. US dollar up continues to equal cocoa down as prices have drifted 7.6% lower in the last four sessions. Rumors today that the same weather that has devastated Russia’s wheat crop may be affecting Russia’s sugar beet crop aiding in a 4.68% rally in sugar today. Before today the fundamental and technical picture looked bearish, we suggest traders positioned short have an exit strategy if this situation gets worse. Aggressive traders can continue to gain bearish option exposure in December cotton. OJ broke lower today closing 3.67% down below the 100 day MA. Prices have come off 6% and we think there could be an additional 5-8% too follow. Treasuries spiked higher to fresh 2001 highs on news that the Fed will continue to support the debt market. This is mind boggling and in my opinion they are just kicking the can down the road. Eventually our clients will get short but we’ve done nothing of late as the trend remains up. Very impressive reversal in the metals as gold and silver reversed higher on the Fed meeting. As we said yesterday trade the breakout in December gold; above the 50 day at $1215 or below the 100 day MA at $1192. Silver prices pared losses to close back above the 50 and 100 day MA 40 cents off its lows. We suggest stops just below $18; today’s low was $17.96 so depending on your placement you may have been stopped out. Clients still are holding December call spreads expecting a push higher but the longer prices take to trade above $18.70/ounce the less likely it will happen on this leg. All Ag was lower with the exception of rice which we’re entertaining buying for clients. I trade very little rice so am open to any suggestions. Just based on the chart and talking to a prospective client who actively trades rice who said prices are below the cost of production I have an interest. We expect wheat, soybeans and corn to move lower from here. In terms of positioning clients we want to buy dips in corn if prices come down 5-8%. The December KCBOT/CBOT has moved 30 cents this week; those lucky enough to pick up a piece of this move should book partial profits. There should be another 10-15 cents in the trade but it has moved so quick we suggest lightening up ahead of the USDA report. The dollar maintained a positive note but is well of its highs. Intra-day prices were higher by nearly 1% and above the 200 day MA. On more upside we expect other currencies to fall with the exception of the Yen. Aggressive traders could fade rallies in the Euro, Pound, Swissie, Aussie or Loonie. Risk Disclosure: The risk of loss in trading commodity futures and options can be substantial.

2010-08-12,Risk is ON 8/12/10 ,"We suggest continuing to trail stops on shorts or take partial profits in Crude oil. Could we go lower, yes…but prices have dropped 8.5% in the last week so this pace in our opinion is not sustainable. We suggested heating oil hedgers to establish additional hedges today; yesterday we advised January upside protection today December. Natural gas injections came in line with expectations today. We suggest scaling into long futures in October and purchasing November 50 cent call spreads. Indices punched back up to the 50 day MA’s but any bounce we view as temporary. We suggest remaining short expecting a trade to 1050-1025 in September S&P futures. For option traders in September ES we may opt to move positions out to October or November…stay tuned. Sugar is back above the 200 day MA; we suggest going to cash as prices could go either way. Breakout higher in cotton; futures traders should have been stopped out at a small loss. Some clients hold December put options and are under water. We maintain that 83.50 cotton is too high and expect 76/77 cents. On signs of a top we may suggest averaging in on the puts. Until we are convinced a top is in Treasuries 30-yr bonds and 10-yr notes will remain on our radar but clients will not be in the trade. Those interested in the short end of the curve could scale into shorts with tight stops. Recognize this is against the trend and clients have lost on this multiple times! December gold closed above the 50 day MA today for the first time since June 30th. Aggressive traders could buy the breakout with tight stops. As long as silver remains above the 200 day MA on a closing basis we are OK being long but on a breach a trade below $17 is likely. We suggest new entries trade December futures and option traders could buy December call spreads. A friendly USDA report helped Ag commodities gain on the day; corn was higher by 2.7%, soybeans by 1.3% and wheat by 2.6%. Wheat exports also aided in the rally as foreign buyers are shifting buys from Russia here to the States. As wheat goes so do grain prices. Today some clients were buyers of December 2011 corn futures and for option traders we suggested buying December $5.00 calls and October $3.80 puts ( a strangle). The dollar has advanced just over 3% this week and it appears there is more left in the bulls tank. Continue to fade rallies in the Euro, Swissie, Aussie and Loonie.

2010-08-13,Shout out to Santelli 8/13/10 ,"One simple question does anyone beside Rick Santelli understand the ramifications of kicking the can down the road? Oil appears to have dropped enough to find some interested buyers trading down just over 7% this week. We’ve advised traders to take at least partial profits on shorts as there should not be much more work on the downside in our opinion. Likewise the distillates have reached our downside objectives so we’ve suggested hedgers to re-institute their upside long hedges. RBOB prices have fallen 11% in the last eight sessions but $1.90 should support. As for heating oil prices have depreciated 9% and could have 2-4% additional slide but no more in our opinion. Natural gas appears to be building a solid base; we’re recommending scaling into long futures and/or purchasing November 50 cent call spreads. Indices could not decide on direction today essentially treading water. Traders’ short futures should trail down stops. We advised clients in September put options to move out to October as we could get a dead cat bounce from here and we want the additional month time. We advised buying October 1100/1000 1:2 put spreads for just over $600/per plus fees. Prices in the S&P are expected to wander between 1125 and 1025 for the next few weeks. Sugar may resume its move higher gaining almost12% from its intra-week lows. We prefer getting long with clients at lower levels…stay tuned. Cotton has gained just over 15% in the last three weeks trading near a 1 1/2 year highs. We’ve been selling into strength with clients expecting a set back. We suggest having a small position in December options and adding to it once prices roll over. With today’s higher trade in Treasuries we’ve completed a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement. On a rally in equities next week could bonds and notes find an interim top? The trend remains up in gold but the premiums are pricey for options. In my opinion the only viable play is a long in futures with tight stops; the 50 day MA is $1214, the 100 day MA is $1195. Play the breakout in silver; above $18.20 or below $17.76. We like December call spreads as they allow flexibility for traders in case of a large short term correction. Wheat’s close was ugly with prices in CBOT wheat down 8 cents on the week and KCBOT closing up 22 cents on the week. The December KCBOT/CBOT spread mentioned earlier this week traded from 30 cents under to a 3 cent premium. We continue to like buying corn on dips and have advised client’s bullish option plays and futures trades with a longer term view. We could get a break short term and that is why we suggested October puts if leery of too much bullish exposure. The US dollar was higher all five sessions this week gaining decisively lifting prices to three week highs. Continue to fade rallies in the Euro, Swissie, Aussie and Loonie. If the Yen breaks the 20 day MA next week we may have some bearish trade suggestions. Risk Disclosure: The risk of loss in trading commodity futures and options can be substantial.

2010-08-31,Gold Rally Over? Don't Bet On It,"Think gold's rally is looking tired? It might be time to think otherwise. Analysts raised their 2011 forecasts more than for any other precious metal the past two months, predicting a 10th annual advance, data compiled by Bloomberg show. To boot, Bloomberg reports the most widely held options contract on gold is the December $1,500 contract. Bloomberg goes on to highlight that investors have accumulated some 278 tons in gold assets this year through 10 exchange traded products. That's good news for funds like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the second-largest ETF in the world by assets. Hedge funds love gold and gold ETFs. Just look at George Soros. Despite Soros Fund Management LLC's sale of 341,250 GLD shares in the second-quarter, the fund still owns 5.24 million shares of the ETF. The median forecast for gold by 29 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is $1,500 sometime next year. Of course, GLD isn't the only game in town. iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) offers bullion-backed exposure at a comparable expense rate. For those craving Swiss storage, the ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (NYSE: SGOL) is the way to go. Leveraged plays are also worth a look for short-term traders. The ProShares Ultra Gold ETF (NYSE: DGP) attempts to mirror twice the performance of gold bullion as measured by the U.S. Dollar p.m. fixing price for delivery in London. The PowerShares DB Gold Double Long ETN (NYSE: DGP) is another option to consider. This ETN tracks the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity index - Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return.

2010-09-02,Getting Lean and Mean - Interview With Peter Schiff - Zing Talk,"Peter Schiff is the president of EuroPacific Capital. Peter is a widely-followed financial commentator and author of the book, How An Economy Grows And Why It Crashes. He was nice enough to grant Benzinga another interview on Benzinga's Podcast: Zing Talk. Download the mp3. Be sure to subscribe to the podcast in iTunes. First things first - in your last interview with Benzinga, you said that you felt that gold was going to go up to 5,000 an ounce. Do you still feel that's true? What sort of timeline are you expecting? I think it’s going to go there, it’s just a matter how long its going to take, I don’t think it’ll take 10-20 years, it can do that in a year, or two years, or six months, I don’t know. But I do think the price of gold is going higher, so from that perspective you don’t have to know how high it’s going to go, just that its going higher than it is today. Now that the primary season has ended and your campaign is over - do you intend to stay politically active this election cycle? Possibly run as an independent? I’m not running for office as an independent, so the answer to that is no, might I do something to help other candidates? I might, I’m certainly open to helping other candidates. Any candidates in general? I’ve endorsed Rand Paul, he’s running for Senator in Kentucky. He hasn’t approached me for active support, though. In 2008, you were an advisor to Congressman Ron Paul for the presidential election. What do you think about his son, Rand Paul entering politics? Rand understands the problems, and he understands the solutions, so I support him. I think he’s sincere. Very familiar with Rand’s father, he has a lot of integrity, and I think his son shares that. I think we need more people like Rand running for office. Are the midterm elections going to have a big impact on the market, or is that just an exaggerated idea? I think gridlock would be better than what we have now, anything that we pass is just doing damage. So the extent that we can put the breaks on the Obama agenda - that’s a positive. The market is still going down, and the depression is still going to proceed, but the Republicans aren’t going to do the right thing either. They might stop the Democrats from doing more than they would otherwise do. You feel the Republican Party isn’t offering a better direction? No. The Republicans - some of them are objecting to the things that Obama is doing, but if Bush were doing them, they’d support him. Why weren’t the Republicans opposed to George Bush? Are they going to push for what we need? Cuts in government spending? Cuts in entitlement spending? No. Are they going to get the government out of the housing market? No. The problems are still going to be there regardless. Do you advocate getting rid of Fannie and Freddie entirely? Privatize them? Well, there’s no way to privatize them. They were privatized before, with government guarantees. Without government guarantees, they’d go bankrupt. Last time we spoke the economy seemed like it may have been on the path to recovery. Now even the Fed is worried about a possible double-dip, and they’re ramping up their quantitative easing strategy to combat that. Where do you think the economy is headed -- and what can we do sustain a recovery? The only people who thought the economy was recovering didn’t understand why it was sick, so they believed it was recovering when it was becoming more infected with the same disease. The problem is because of the cost of the government stimulus, the economy is sicker now than it was before. We have greater imbalances, we’re deeper in debt and worst of all, we have socialized more of the economy. So we’re moving away from a market based economy to essentially a planned economy, and that’s just compounding the problem. The reason the economy was in trouble is because interest rates were too low for too long, government subsidies to housing caused Americans to spend too much money. Now reality is coming back, and Americans have realized that they’re broke, and they’ve rightly making decisions to stop spending, and start saving. We have to move from a phony economy where we just spend borrowed money, to a real one where everyone is saving money and we produce things. The recession is the bad medicine we have to swallow to get better. Any initatives that might be done that could help that process (the recovery) along? We need the government to get out of the way. There are certain things the government can do legislatively that won’t cost any money - they can deregulate health care. They can stop subsidizing education - cause college to become cheaper. Cut the pay for government workers and entitlement spending. If we can repeal these rules and regulations, we can make America more competitive and attract foreign capital. We can right this ship. How would education come down if we remove the subsidies? The government guarantees student loans, much like mortgages - so they have more money to spend. Without subsidies, colleges would be forced to lower the prices. What we need in colleges is a seventy-five percent off sale. One more question - has Art Laffer paid up? No. In fact, Laffer says I haven’t won the bet. He says the economy was in great shape. The only reason it collapsed a few years later was because of mistakes made. He says the economy was the best ever. Interested in profiting from the upside in gold? Check out SPDR Gold Shares Trust (NYSE: GLD), iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), or ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (NYSE: SGOL), all of which hold physical gold bullion. If you share some of Peter's concerns about our economy, you should consider owning physical gold. John Burbank also recommended owning physical gold in his interview with Benzinga.

2010-09-19,"September 20, 2010: Fantasy Football and Your Income  Portfolio","Is there a potential Bill Gross or Sir John Templeton who consistently assembles the winning fantasy football team? Effective portfolio selection and constructing the moving parts of a fantasy football team utilize similar concepts. The list below illustrates the premise.1. Admit you are probably not the most astute member of the league. You probably aren't. Warren Buffett is fond of saying if you are playing poker and ... don't know who the patsy is, it's you. A well prepared investor knows that there are many investors who know more about any given acquisition at any time, given the advanced information gathering techniques available. Play to win, but don't get cocky. 2. Be prepared in advance for acquisition. Have a plan. You should know your risk tolerance and begin to implement a strategy to suit your long term needs.In fantasy football roster assimilation, one does not chose a tight end, kicker and an aged running back with the first few selections to form a core holding. The core holding for stability is a quarterback. For most investors a portfolio of relatively stable, diversified low cost income etf's should be at the center of one's portfolio. Other, more speculative securities may be added to provide zest for your planned acquisitions to fill out the portfolio. 3. Acquire proven quality with your first picks. Don't speculate at this stage. You need Drew Brees, not Seneca Wallace. At this time, Vanguard's Short Term Corporate Bond ETF (BSV), Templeton's Global Income Fund (GIM) and PIMCO's Short Term Maturity Strategy ETF (MINT) fit the bill. 4. Create a balanced roster. Don't overload in one yield field. Drew Brees alone won't guarantee your fantasy football team a victory, nor will government bonds do likewise for your portfolio. You need a productive running back, wide receiver, tight end, kicker, defensive unit and a flexible bench. Weak or under-represented income sectors will cause you to under perform. Solid picks in this category are IShare's U.S. Preferred Stock Index ETF (PFF), Powershare's Commodity Index Tracking ETF (DBC),Barclay's Capital Convertible Securities ETF (CWB), Barclay's Capital Aggregate Short/Intermediate Bond ETF (LAG),IShare's Emerging Market Debt ETF (EMB) and for your defense, the Permanent Portfolio Fund (PRPFX). In a previous column, I outlined a do-it-yourself permanent portfolio fund using etf's that will likely mimic PRPFX. Gold alone as a hedge is best purchased through IShare's Gold ETF (IAU).5. Work hardest to find overlooked acquisitions. Sweat the details. Some of my finest fantasy picks and securities have been chosen by digging through details to discover overlooked gems. Arian Foster and Wes Cooley come to mind. High yields can be achieved through disciplined acquisition of preferred stocks, especially structured preferreds. My criteria for selecting these 6.75-8% gems is a multi-step process: investment grade, decent trading volume, yield is compelling (you will regularly find mispriced preferreds as the computer model fast traders generally don't appear to hit them hard), buy below the call price and sell when the stock price is 5% or greater over the call. An example is Deutsche Bank Capital Trust II (DXB). I also like preferred securities that play a nice dividend plus have inflation protection over and above TIPS, such as Prudential Financial, Inc. Preferred (PFK).6. Always look to upgrade your roster. Don't hesitate to jettison a weak performer, but don't churn your roster. When an acquisition goes down due to injury or poor performance, dump it. Why hold into a Ryan Grant or Sidney Rice, hoping against hope they return from an injury? Why hold significant positions in long duration bonds or solely in U.S. Dollars just to tweak yield when the present economic climate begs for future inflation to pay off our trillions of dollars in debt with cheap dollars? Explore select Master Limited Partnership's individually, not bundled into an etf at this time.7. Be gracious in victory. Learn from your defeats. While winning with well-chosen acquisitions provide a measure of wealth (monetary, ego or both), defeat - losing with your best laid strategy - offers an opportunity to learn and better prepare for the next round of opportunities. 8. Luck does play a part in success. Remember that the more prepared you are, the luckier you get."
2010-10-05,ETF Stats for September 2010: Vanguard Not Content With Third Place,"New ETF creation activity picked up in September as 27 new products came on the market. New arrivals consisted of 25 ETFs and two ETNs. Vanguard was singularly responsible for the majority of new listings, launching 16 new ETFs in two separate waves. Particularly noteworthy about the Vanguard launches is the fact that all 16 ETFs follow the same indexes as existing ETFs from iShares and SPDRs. In all 16 cases Vanguard chose to differentiate itself on price and brand. Vanguard is not content with its current position of being the third largest ETF supplier. Six ETFs were delisted during in September, leaving the net increase for the month at 21. The number of currently listed products stands at 1,067 (959 ETFs and 108 ETNs) as of September 30. A total of 173 products have been launched year-to-date and 31 have closed for a net increase of 142. Six additional closures for October have already been announced, and more new listings are a sure bet. Trading picked up in September following the normally slow month of August. Average trading activity came in at $60.9 billion per day, up about 1% over August. Since there was one less trading day in September, the small daily increase did not carry over into the monthly stats where total ETP dollar volume declined -3.5% to $1.28 trillion. The number of ETFs in the Billion Dollar Club, averaging more than $1 billion in daily trading activity, remained at eight again this month. Products averaging more than $100 million per day came in at 64, a slight increase from August. At the other extreme, the number of products on ETF Deathwatch decreased by four to 149. Two of the new ETF introductions were actively-managed, pushing the selection of actively-managed ETFs currently on the market to 29. One of the new “passively-indexed” products, Barclays ETN+ S&P VEQTOR ETN (VQT), pushes the envelope on indexing by incorporating daily reconstitution that can alter 100% of the holdings in a single day. Assets in ETFs and ETNs increased +10.6% for the month and now sit at $900.9 billion, a +13.9% increase for the year-to-date period.

2010-10-08,ETF Rivalries To Watch,"With the amount of exchange traded products available to U.S. investors pushing 1,100 (ETFs and ETNs combined) there are of course plenty of “me too” funds or ETFs from different issuers that basically do the same thing. That presents the possibility of some interesting ETF rivalries. Moving beyond the obvious, such as the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM) vs. the Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock ETF (NYSE: VWO) or virtually any of Vanguard's lower-cost offerings that challenge select sector SPDRs and a variety of other iShares funds, there are some other some other ETF rivalries that may be brewing. No, this isn't the Lakers/Celtics or Yankees/Red Sox, but here's an interesting list of potential ETF rivalries. iShares Comex Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) vs. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD): iShares recently split IAU and cut its expense ratio in an effort to mount a challenge to the throne held by GLD in the world of physical gold ETFs. IAU already had decent volume, so this could be a match-up to watch. Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: BRF) vs. iShares MSCI Brazil Small-Cap Index Fund (NYSE: EWZS): EWZS is the new kid on this block and had better come up with something nifty to challenge BRF because BRF just went over $1 billion in assets and both funds have the same expense ratio, 0.65%. iShares MSCI China Small Cap Index Fund (NYSE: ECNS) vs. Guggenheim China SmallCap ETF (NYSE: HAO): ECNS has the lower expense ratio, but HAO is the original China small-cap play. Oddly enough, ECNS debuted at a price well above HAO's, almost rendering the difference in expense ratios a moot point. If the expense ratio becomes an issue, Guggenheim could just lower HAO's if the firm sees assets leaving in favor of ECNS. Market Vectors Poland ETF (NYSE: PLND) vs. iShares MSCI Poland Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: EPOL): PLND was the first, but EPOL might already be asserting itself as the winner here with better volume and a great yield of over 6%. Market Vectors Indonesia ETF (NYSE: IDX) vs. iShares MSCI Indonesia Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: EIDO): EIDO faces a problem: A lot of investors think there's only Indonesia-specific ETF on the market and they think it's IDX. Actually, EIDO has decent volume and trades for almost $60 less than IDX, so it could make some more inroads against the more established Market Vectors offering. iShares MSCI Philippines Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: EPHE) vs. Global X's proposed Philippines ETF: This rivalry is based on the assumption that Global X will make good on plans to bring a Philippines-specific ETF to market. Global X has proven adept at introducing successful new funds and at attracting investor inflows, so if the issuer makes the Philippines ETF happen, we could be in for an interesting battle here. ETFS Physical Silver Shares (NYSE:SIVR) vs. iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV): Yes, there are two ETFs backed by physical silver. SLV is the volume king here, but SIVR has an expense ratio of 0.3% compared to 0.5% for SLV. That's enough to make SIVR worth a look for the investor looking for silver exposure."
2010-10-12,Goldman's Golden Gold Forecast Should Benefit These ETFs,"Gold and its seemingly never-ending run to new heights got another boost on Monday with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) saying the yellow metal could be trading as high as $1,650 an ounce in a year. Goldman added that gold could see $1,400 an ounce in three months and $1,525 an ounce in six months and recommended buying Comex December 2011 gold futures and January 2011 Nymex platinum. For those that opt not to play the futures market, the platinum play is the ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT). Backed by physical platinum, PPLT and its cousin, the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) have become trendy picks to play a rebound in global auto demand. As for gold, if you're looking beyond the usual suspects like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), the ProShares Ultra Gold ETF (NYSE: UGL) is a fine way to leverage your returns on gold's ascent. For whatever reason, the PowerShares DB Gold ETF (NYSE: DGL) rarely makes it into the gold ETF conversation, but don't ignore this fund. DGL tracks a rules-based index composed of futures contracts on gold and is intended to reflect the performance of gold. It goes without saying gold miners benefit from high gold prices, so be sure to be involved with either the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) or the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Silver is the derivative play of choice, though it wasn't mentioned in the Goldman report. The Market Vectors Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) is the way to go on that front."
2010-10-14,Out-of-Control Gold Meets Leveraged ETN and ETF Products ,"Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) have become the new fad for 401k plans and individual investors. Folks have been flocking to the key gold ETFs via SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) and even the ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (NYSE: SGOL). In fact, the SPDR Gold Trust would be one of the top five or six central government banks in the world if measured solely in gold holdings. Anytime you get a hot market, as we can see now with gold, you can bet more investment vehicles pop up to capitalize on the fad. Enter leveraged gold ETFs and ETNs, which add another layer to playing the gold market right now. Two of the most obvious and liquid note-funds from the same family that take on leverage in the directional gold trades are the PowerShares DB Gold Double Long ETN (NYSE: DGP) and PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ).

2010-10-27,Dollar Up Equals…. 10/27/10,"The last few posts we've referenced a dead cat bounce in the US dollar and how it will affect other markets. Have you listened? Conflicting figures in today's' inventory report as a large build in Crude was canceled out by a large draw in RBOB. The 20 day MA in December at $82.50 should act as resistance as our target remains $77/78. December and January natural gas was able to gain for the third consecutive session today. A bottom may be in the making as we've advised clients willing to stay with the trade to have light bullish exposure in December and January contracts. Indices appear that they will close lower but we will need to see a settlement below the 20 day MA; today's low before BEARS grab the steering wheel. A breach of 10970 in the Dow and 1065 in the S&P should bring lower trade. Clients are advised to purchase December bear put spreads. Again today cocoa was unable to hold onto its gains with prices now back below the 50 day MA. Cotton traded down limit and has traded up or down limit several times in recent dealing. This Wild West action is not for me or my clients. We do feel in the weeks to come there will be a time to gain bearish exposure but for now hold off. We've started pricing our bearish plays in March coffee for clients…stay tuned. The action looks lower in Treasuries and we've advised clients to gain bearish exposure; our targets are 127'00 in 30-yr bonds and 124'00 in 10-yr notes. On a trade down to the 20 day MA in live cattle we would look to re-establish longs for clients. We will likely be re-establishing longs in February lean hogs from lower levels as well…stay tuned. December gold challenged the trend line closing down 1% today. The 20 day MA continues to cap rallies at $1342. Our downside target remains $1250/1270. A failed rally in silver with December lower by 1% BUT until we get a settlement below the 20 day MA at $23.30 shorts are grasping at straws. That being said some or our aggressive clients are positioned short expecting a trade closer to $21. Larger clients were advised to start scaling into longs in 11′ corn while smaller and more conservative clients should hold onto the hope of buying a dip in either corn or soybeans ahead of the USDA report. The US dollar was higher by .55% today poised for a breakout to 80/81…only my opinion. We advised clients to short other crosses and have light exposure in bearish positions in the Yen and Loonie with clients.

2010-11-01,Monday Randoms,"First up is an interesting quote from the Asia Trader column in Barron's;Kazakhstan plans to list a dozen of its mining and oil companies over the next two years on various Asian bourses, raising billions of dollars, says Kairat Kelimbetov, CEO of the Kazakh sovereign wealth fund, Samruk-Kazyna. We want to list our companies in Asia rather than London or New York because our market is China, says Kelimbetov.Kazakhstan and I would also say Mongolia have the potential to be very interesting investment destinations. They each have vast resources and many obstacles but both should become increasingly important to the world economic order.Who knows whether the logic for seeking listings in Asia is the best thing for Kazakhstan--given the amount of investment capital in the US that I think will be looking to deploy into new countries it seems shortsighted--but it is not difficult to imagine that Asia will be more important fundamentally to Kazakhstan. I take this as a world getting flatter sort of comment. To the extent the world is getting flatter in this regard I take it as a tie in to US based investors gaining access to more and more parts of the world as time goes on.Barry Ritholtz posted some recent comments from Felix Zulauf as follows;He suggests a portfolio that is 20% in gold (he accurately predicted in 2009 that gold would hit $1,300 this year); 30% to 40% in mostly emerging-market equities; and the rest in three-year government bonds, denominated in such currencies as the Singapore dollar and the Swiss franc.Other than the Sing dollar this is pretty easy to replicate with ETFs. I am aware of three gold bullion ETFs; iShares Gold Trust (IAU), ETFS Gold Trust (SGOL) and SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) which we own for clients. The Sprott Gold Trust is more of closed end fund.In terms of the equity exposure he prefers, that term is useless but there are obviously many country funds that would tie in thematically to what he has in mind along with other specialized funds from GlobalX and Emerging Global Shares to name a couple.Anyone looking to go heavy into country funds needs to be cognizant of the sector make ups of these funds. Funds covering places like Egypt, Poland and Singapore are very heavy in financial stocks while something like the iShares Peru Fund is very heavy in materials and other funds still are reasonably balanced like the iShares New Zealand Fund (ENZL). A combo of different types of funds can certainly get it done allowing for covering a lot of geographic ground, embedding different fundamental attributes and subtler things like managing volatility...all made even easier using a common stock to two as well.As for debt from Singapore and Switzerland I continue to believe that this will be possible soon. We have already seen filings for regional bond funds and from there the funds should get narrower.Every year around Halloween my wife and I endure something truly scary. It happens every year and even though we are pretty sure it is coming it scares the hell out of us anyway. Of course I am talking about our annual renewal notice for our health insurance. This year was a particularly aggressive price hike of 25%. Last year we upped our deductible to $7000 so that our premium would go down by about $9. This year we could up it to $10,000 to have it drop $8 per month or pay an extra $59 per month to have the same deductible.This price hike is on the high side compared to past years but not the highest single one year increase. I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation for the huge increase and while thankfully the $59 increase is not a hardship, in the seven years I've been with this company we gone from $200 per month with a microscopic deductible to $275 and a big deductible. Where will it be in seven more years? We have no debt to service so we can withstand whatever might come but this will obviously not be true for a lot of people.I have no societal solution here but it raises an important financial and retirement planning issues as increases in premium costs seems to be totally unpredictable far more so than various taxes we all pay, utility bills we all pay and any debt that people have. The only other thing I can think of that is an ongoing expense of sorts that is very difficult to plan for would be the various one-offs that come every month like new tires, unexpected dental events, vet bills, house repairs and so on. This is yet another reason why retirement planning is very complicated. The best answer I can come up with is save more and live below your means. If world markets go up a lot in the next 15 years, or whatever time frame you care about, then your portfolio should go up a lot too but if world markets do not go up a lot then saving and spending become even more important."
2010-11-01,Muted start to a New Month 11/1/10,"With prices settling back above the 20 day MA for the first time in two weeks, Crude oil may trade up to the recent highs about 2.0-2.5% from today's close. This rally should be short lived as we expect a trade back to $77/78 before a run to $90 late this year. Natural gas failed at the 50 day MA and reversed trading down just over 5% as of this post. Clients that trailed their stop loss orders were taken out a profit. We will be looking to re-enter longs in the coming sessions in both futures and options with clients, most likely from lower levels. A reversal in the stock indices should have the equity markets closing flat in today's session. Expect fireworks this week but as we've voiced in previous sessions a close below the 20 day MA should find more selling. Those levels come in at 11020 in the Dow and 1170 in the S&P. Aggressive clients that agree with the trade are advised to purchase December ES put options. Cocoa continued its slide lower closing under the 50 day MA on its way to our target at 2600/2650. Cotton closed up limit today gaining 3.19%. Coffee rolled over giving back most of its gains from last Friday losing 2.83% today. We will likely have some bearish trade recommendations in the days to come…stay tuned. We will be looking to gain bearish exposure in the Treasury complex (30-yr bonds & 10-yr notes) this week but for now we're holding off until Wednesday's FOMC meeting. Aggressive clients were advised to start scaling into longs in '11 live cattle contracts today. We advised the purchase of February futures and selling $1.02 calls 1:1 against the futures. Flip a coin in metals this week with too many unanswered questions we anticipate a large move but do not have a feel in which direction. We advise waiting until next week to establish any fresh position. There is much talk of a short squeeze that could lead to $30 silver in the coming weeks but we're not buying in just yet. The sentiment is extremely bullish but unless a position is already established like gold we hold off until next week. If today proves to be an interim top in grains buy this dip ahead of the USDA report. If corn was to fill the gap in the chart from two weeks ago prices would retrace just over 8% and in soybeans it would represent a retracement of just over 6%. We're still expecting a dead cat bounce in the dollar lifting prices to 80/81 in the coming weeks. The Yen looks like it has the farthest to fall but it would take a settlement below the 20 day MA at 1.2265 for us to add to out clients December put position. Continue to sell rallies in the Swiss franc as .9750 is our target. Risk Disclosure: The risk of loss in trading commodity futures and options can be substantial.

2010-12-03,Gold and Silver Spike After Job Report,"This morning spot gold and silver are both reacting positive after the government job report. The U.S. Dollar Index declined by 0.69 cents to $79.60 and this will often help to inflate the precious metals which are now considered a true form of currency. There is also chatter of a possible QE-3 by the Federal Reserve Bank and this action would only keep the U.S. Dollar Index down. Therefore, all precious metals would benefit from higher cash reserves. The iShares Silver Trust(NYSE: SLV) is trading higher by 0.30 cents to $28.34 this morning. The SPDR gold shares are trading higher by $1.36 to $135.56. The iShares Comex Gold Trust(NYSE: IAU) is trading higher by 0.14 cents in the pre-market to $13.68. Should the U.S. Dollar Index decline and the European Union continue to have trouble gold and silver can trade higher."

2011-01-19,AGOL: Now You Can Buy Gold Stored in Singapore,"ETFS Physical Asian Gold Shares (AGOL), the latest offering from London-based ETF Securities, began trading last Friday (1/14/11). It will custody its physical gold bullion with JP Morgan Chase Bank in secure LBMA (London Bullion Market Association) approved vaults in Singapore. Each share represents a direct interest in physical gold bullion. The initial quantity is 0.1 ounce of gold per share, which will be reduced over time to pay the 0.39% expense ratio. ETFs based on physical gold have been very popular with investors, amassing nearly $65 billion in assets. Four ETFs backed by physical gold: SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) launched in late 2004, making it the first ETF in this category. It is currently the largest gold bullion ETF with $58 billion in gold bars stored in London and has an expense ratio of 0.40%. iShares Gold Trust (IAU) is currently the ETF with the lowest expense ratio at 0.25% and each share represents 0.01 ounces of gold (less expenses). It has more than $5 billion in assets and stores its gold in New York, Toronto, London, and other locations. ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (SGOL), launched in September 2009, are backed by 0.1 ounces of gold (less expenses of 0.39%) with the gold stored in Switzerland. ETFS Physical Asian Gold Shares (AGOL) launched last week has an expense ratio of 0.39% and stores its gold in Singapore. Additional information about AGOL is located in the press release, summary page, fact sheet (pdf), and prospectus (pdf). Disclosure covering writer, editor, and publisher: Long GLD.

2011-01-19,Gold Prices Claw Higher,"were clawing their way higher Wednesday as moderate buying continued, but prices were still trapped in a tight range."
2011-01-19,A Tipping Point 1/19/11,"Have stocks and commodities traded high enough to take some money off the table? A close below the 50 day MA today likely means lower ground; that level is $91.55 in March. No claim to a crystal ball but my assumption is we will see a trade to $88/89 in the coming weeks. An upside break out in natural gas today means longs could re-enter the markets with stops below the recent lows. We should be issuing some option trade recommendations in the coming sessions. Today the indices lost 1-3% but until we break the 20 day MA's the bulls retain control. We suggested for some of the further out of the money Marches put spread holders to buy back their bottom legs today. A close below 1265 in the S&P leads me to believe 1225 could be in play…trade accordingly. Our favored play in the currency sector remains bearish exposure in the Loonie and Cable. Our targets are .9850 and 1.5700 respectively. Traders should be trading the March contracts either futures or options; today we suggested purchasing .9900 puts in the CAD. We are operating under the influence that we will get an additional 2-3% retracement in lean hogs and live cattle in the short run. Gold ands silver made new highs but neither metal was able to hold onto their gains. We suspect a probe higher but would suggest trailing stops being today's action was far from strong. March silver will need to overtake $29.75 and February gold $1385 very soon too see higher ground. If this does not happen almost immediately we will get a correction first…only my opinion. I have said this many times in the past follow oats and the other grains will follow…a near 3% loser today. Corn was lower by 2.77% while soybeans were marginally lower. As we voiced yesterday expect a correction in the short run in both these markets. Those willing to stay with a trade for several weeks could consider buying December 11′ corn and selling March 11′. Cocoa advanced to a six week high and on a trade above 3150 we could be off to the races…remain long. Coffee closed below the 20 day MA for the first time in 2011, our suggestion is to sell rallies. We've started to track options for the month of May…stay tuned. Risk Disclosure: The risk of loss in trading commodity futures and options can be substantial.

2011-02-03,The Dollar and Lack of Correlations 2/3/11,"The dollar will likely bounce from here but that does not mean commodities priced in dollars will all lose their value…case in point today's action. Very indecisive action in Crude and the distillates today. We favor bullish exposure but a breach of the 50 and 100 day MA likely brings prices back near the trend line at $86.50 in March. We are cautiously long willing to cut and run with clients on a trade lower and add length on a new high…trade accordingly. In March natural gas a trade closer to $4 and we would start exploring longs again for clients until then stand aside. As we alluded to yesterday all eyes will be focused on the jobs number for the next leg in securities albeit higher or lower…we have no feel clearly thinking a correction is long overdue. A dead cat bounce in the greenback…yes a near 1% appreciation today. Continue to fade rallies in the Pound and Euro; lower by 1.3% and 0.25% as of this post. Live cattle traded down today but were able to maintain the 20 day MA once again. We like scaling into longs in April expecting fresh contract highs. Both gold and silver were higher by nearly the same amount on a percentage basis picking up 1.4%. Longs may have dodge a bullet as we should be back near the highs in coming weeks. For confirmation it would take settlements over the 50 day MA in silver at $28.80 and above the 100 day MA in gold at $1360. Day one of a correction in Ag's…we would like to see additional downside to get clients long ahead of next week's USDA report. The likely play will come buying new crop corn and soybeans for clients at some juncture early next week…stay tuned. 3o-yr bonds and 10-yr notes are breaking down, on a trade below the mid-December lows look for selling to intensify. A thirty year high in sugar yesterday followed by a near 10% one day correction. This is why timing is so important when trading with leverage! If the trend line is breached just below 32 cents in sugar we could see additional 10-15% depreciation. Cotton was down the daily trading limit with a bearish engulfing candle. Are we finally going to get the correction we've been calling for? We expect to see 10-15% depreciation in the coming weeks and have advised bearish options trade in May. Coffee traded marginally higher today but we suggest gaining bearish options exposure thinking a 7-10% swoon is coming in this market as well.

2011-02-17,Gold Doesn't Have To Weigh A Ton - (CEF) (GTU) (PHYS) (PSLV),"In the investing world there are many debates taking place simultaneously. There is the inflation versus deflation debate or the gold versus the dollar debate which are only a couple of the ones drawing passionate responses from each camp. I have written pretty extensively on my own blog regarding gold and silver but due to a bunch of emails I received I thought that it might be useful to bring information to a wider audience than what my blog currently reaches. I have added to an article that I originally posted at Monetaadvisors.com which discusses gold, silver and purchasing the assets. I have heard all the arguments regarding the precious metals : you can't eat them, they don't pay a dividend, you can't properly value it, and my favorite it takes a greater fool to drive the price higher. I am not going to take the time to pick apart the arguments as I am sure many articles do, but instead I am going to make the assumption that you dear reader have heard all the arguments pro and con and are interested in methods of acquiring the metals or exposure to them. The reason I am not going to debate the merits of the precious metals is because I am taking the Mark Twain view of the metals as to whether or not they have palace in your portfolio. To paraphrase Twain he once said, “when I was 18 I thought that my father was the dumbest man to ever walk the face of the earth, but when I was 21 I was astonished by how much the old man had learned in 3 years”. We live in this wonderful age of technology and advanced society so we tend to believe that we know better and more than all those who came before us and this mindset applies to all of our leaders , economists and financial types. The worl of today that is completely dominated FIAT currencies backed only by the good faith and credit of said governments. Throughout history these experiments in “detached” currencies have always lead to ruin overtime as they expand too much or just become corrupted. The Romans clipping coins or eventually only plating them with the precious metal covering contributed to their eventual demise as an empire or the French Assignat that was printed in to oblivion lead to the downfall of France and the rise of Napolean. You see dear reader, today we are much smarter and use fiat currencies the correct way and expand credit and everything will work out perfectly, of course I am being facetious. Many of the elements of the current environment we live in reminds me of a cross between Orwell's “Animal Farm” and Aldous Huxley's “Brave New World”. Like in Animal Farm the rules are being made to benefit the power structure while the masses are viewed more as a resource, which is why the rules keep changing and the citizenry is viewed more and more as a ATM machine. I believe that today's citizenry is slow to realize that they are falling in to the allegorical trap that Orwell was warning about. At the same time today's leaders all bow down to the failed policies of Keynes just as in “Brave New World” their whole myopic society was based upon the supposed ideology of Henry Ford the auto pioneer. At some point people will become 21 and realize that their currency needs to be a store of value not just a medium of exchange needs to be backed by something be it land, gold, water or something that will hold value. I believe that the smart money follows the adage made famous by Ecclesiastes and they already know that there is nothing new under the sun especially when it comes to currencies and their corruption and ruin by the powers that be. There are many smart people who believe that there is a place for precious metals in your portfolio even if it is just insurance; and looking back through financial history has given them plenty of examples from which to draw this conclusion. Please don't misunderstand me I am not stocking bullion sitting in a bunker with cans of beans waiting for finacncial armegeddon to occur, but I do think that the Dollar and all FIAT currencies are being debased and precious metals do provide protection against current policies. In a situation of Fiat money, massive debts, and negative real interest rates precious metals and other tangibles help protect you better than say a stock of Opentable (NASDAQ: OPEN). As an aside Opentable will be one heck of a short once the momentum crowd is done with that issue. While the sentiment toward the precious metals has improved and their correction is still under way I still believe that there is more room to the upside. It is still possible that the $1,400 area will provide enough resistance for a retest of gold down to the $1,225 range and silver down to $23 but I think that is a long shot. Instead I feel that $1,400 is acting like the Maginot line that $325 did taking 4 tries to put that number in the rearview. With all the uncertainly, geopolitical unrest and “non official” inflation I believe it provides a buttressing effect for the precious metals and commodities in general. With the precious metal bull market in full swing you dear reader like many may be considering putting a portion of your portfolio in to bullion. Many investment advisers recommend you put a portion of your investable assets, usually between 5 -15%, into gold and or silver to protect from inflation, deflation and currency debasement. We do live in a volatile era and gold does serve as a store of wealth and an insurance policy against financial turmoil. The precious metals have been rising for 10 straight years and will in all likelihood do so again this year. The point of this post is to address the issue of buying the bullion not to detail all the reasons why it is needed or why contrary to what most people think it has not come anywhere near a peak. The precious metals complex is not for the faint of heart as they can and do gyrate with down swings of 10 -50% in the metals and the shares usually 30+% depending on market cap and other factors. It is highly advisable to purchase a bullion stake as it is a savings vehicle and cannot be printed so it is a store of value. Once you have your bullion allocated and paid for then you can consider putting some capital the mining shares. The shares do have counterparty liability as they are shares of a company and many things can go wrong in a company unlike a bar of metal. Investing in the metal is going to preserve your wealth where as holding the shares can make you wealthy but you accept more risk. Many people don't want to just go out and buy bullion for the following reasons: 1) They don't know where to buy it. 2) They don't know what to buy. 3) They think it is too expensive. 4) It is heavy to transport. 5) They don't have a place to store it. There are alternatives to buying the physical bullion at a coin shop and tossing it in the trunk of the car, weighing it down so the bumper is dragging on the ground. One can buy physical gold on-line through your brokerage account with the click of a mouse. The options for gold ownership beyond bullion are Exchange Traded Funds(ETFs), Closed end funds and lastly digital gold. The ETFs are SPDR Gold Trust(Nyse: GLD), I-Shares Gold ETF(NYSE: IAU), I-Shares silver trust(NYSE: SLV) which are all designed to track the price of gold or silver with the least expense and trade like stock on the US exchanges. There are a couple of closed end funds that act similar to the ETFs but they are governed by the Investment Company Act of 1940 in a similar fashion to a mutual fund, but they trade on exchanges. The closed end funds are Central Fund of Canada (NYSE: CEF) and Central Gold Trust (NYSE: GTU) The last option is digital gold using goldmoney.com, which not only allows you to invest directly in gold, silver, and platinum but also choose whether you wish for it to be vaulted in London, Zurich or Hong Kong. The ETFs and Closed End Funds are very easy to purchase right thru your brokerage account since they all trade on the NYSE it is no different than buying IBM or McDonalds. They are very liquid and run efficiently. There have been questions raised over the years about the gold held in the ETFs as to whether they actually have it or whether it is double or triple owned because it is unallocated. I believe after reading the prospectus that the ETFs hold the gold in an allocated fashion and do not loan it out. The concern that I have is derived from the great depression when gold was confiscated from the general public to revalue it in order to stem the deflation. I do not believe that the US Government would recall the gold from individuals this time as they can easily lay claim to the sixth largest stash of gold by nationalizing GLD. For example, the gold in GLD is held allocated in London, but the fund is run by a US corporation and trustee. In a time of crisis the government has demonstrated its ability to abrogate the law and just seize as they did to the bondholders of GM. It is due to the rapaciousness of the US Government today that I choose not to invest in the ETFs for bullion exposure. I have chosen to utilize the Central Fund of Canada (CEF) which gives me exposure to both gold and silver that is allocated and stored in Canada, run by a Canadian company. The fact that the Gold and Silver is located outside the US gives you geographic diversification and the structure of the company as a foreign entity provides you protection against seizure. The same goes for the closed end fund called the Central Gold Trust (NYSE: GTU) with the exception that it only invests in gold. A concern you should have when in the market to buy a closed end fund is that you have to be aware of the discount/premium to NAV. In other words when the fund is hot and the underlying assets are not keeping up with the price jumps you will pay a premium which can cost you dearly if the underlying asset declines in price then the premium can vanish as the price and your investment value goes down. The trick is to buy when the closed end fund is trading at or close to a discount. In this case since the underlying asset is in a bull market even if you make the error of buying with a large premium you will get bailed out by price rises but your overall return will be less. As I write this blog the premium on CEF at current gold prices is 8.0% which is slightly above its 10 year average of 7.03% and above the roughly 5.0% premium to buy an American Eagle today. CEF has not traded at a discount since about 2001 and while the premium has been lower at times it also has been over 21%. If you believe as I do that gold and silver will trade higher then buying when the premiums are comparable to buying America Eagles makes sense. One also has to factor in to the premium that the fund is roughly 45% silver which has a higher premium when purchasing. Conversely, if you want to buy just gold then Central Gold Trust(GTU) affords you the exact same benefits as CEF, except it is a monometallic composition. At the time of this writing the premium on GTU is a paltry .2% over the spot price, which means that on a cost basis you can acquire bullion protection for less than or equal to buying bars directly from a dealer and you get the benefit of storage and liquidity. GTU is the value at the moment, however, GTU currently not as well known as its cousin CEF; this translates into volume of only around 90K shares per day. If you need liquidity for a large position then CEF is the choice here but if you want value and are looking for a long term holding correlated to gold(because it is gold) then GTU with its low premium make sense. If you are interested in following the premium of CEF then you can follow this link to an online calculator. The results from the calculator are pretty close, but there are discrepancies as one of the components is cash and the level of cash varies in CEF even though the calculator dosen't. I have not found a similar calculator for GTU but one could put together a spreadsheet in excel pretty easily. On can also go to a GTU page that reports the premium\discount on their site. One other advantage of CEF and GTU is that they are structured as PFIC (Passive Foreign Investment Company) for US investors from an IRS perspective. Since they are PFICs you can file a QEF(qualified elective form…IRS Form 8621) which allows you to be taxed at the regular capital gains rate rather than the collectible rate currently pegged at 28%. The IRS considers all forms of gold as collectibles; this includes numismatics, bars, coins, rounds, precious metals held in secure locations like Goldmoney or Bullion Vault. ETFs have their own tax rules as do closed end funds. This is not a simple topic, nothing where the IRS is involved is ever simple, and one should consult with their investment advisor to take advantage of the lower tax rate associated with PIFCs when dealing in CEF or GTU. As a side note since I am updating this article I thought I would mention the Sprott Physical Gold (NYSE: PHYS) and Silver (NYSE : PSLV) Trusts which are trading at 5% and 13.28% premiums at the moment. The structure of both of the Sprott Trusts allows you to file the IRS Form 8621 for the PFIC tax advantage as well. Moving on to Goldmoney.com, which is a “Digital Gold” site. Goldmoney is an online gold holding company founded by James Turk a well known and reputable individual in the gold trade. Goldmoney provides the protections of CEF and even better geographic diversification as you can choose from 3 different country locations to store your allocated gold, silver or platinum. The premium structure is very competitive with buying the bullion outright, but you have the added ability to convert your holdings to different currencies if you desire as well as make payments to vendors that accept digital gold. The drawback to Goldmoney is that it requires paperwork to set up the account and then once it is set up you have to fund it via wire transfer. Additionally, Goldmoney only allows 90 days from receipt to invest the money in metal, after which they wire it back to you account to prevent timing the market I guess. So to get real non-paper bullion there are cost effective options and they won't weigh you down. If you haven't done so yet there is still time to become “21” and take a position to protect yourself.

2011-03-24,Hyperinflation Here We Come!,"Are you prepared for hyperinflation? Here’s why it can be a good idea to prepare. With all of the reckless government spending, many are becoming concerned about the potential devastating effects of inflation. Significant inflation is not only feasible, it is very likely. We are seeing the warning signs with food and energy prices! I wanted to take a few moments to update you on what is going on in the economy, how inflation can be dangerous, and provide several investment ideas that will help us fight inflation in the upcoming days. Why is inflation inevitable? With Democrats and Republicans alike agreeing U.S. debbts are out of control, but no one has a plan to solve our current deficit let alone the whopping debts we have. The Fed has the solution: print more money, devalue the dollar, and pay back the debts with cheaper dollars. What's the price tag? Can you say H-Y-P-E-R Inflation! This will mean we will see massive inflation like never before. This double digit inflation is imminent unless the Fed and/or U.S. Government takes one of two drastic measures: We really only have two ways to pay for our debts: (1) Print more money, which causes inflation, and/or (2) Hike taxes, which kills investment, businesses and jobs. Why is inflation dangerous? Inflation simply means rising prices. But in addition to retail price inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index, you also have monetary inflation - the growth of the money supply, or the total amount of money in the economy. (Our money supply includes dollars, checking and savings accounts, CDs and money market funds, and short-term transfers of securities in exchange for cash.) Here is the great balancing act of the Federal Reserve. If it eases the money supply (think lower interest rates), borrowing costs decrease, and investment generally increases. But with easy money, price inflation and currency devaluation follow. The Fed can fight inflation by raising rates to effectively tighten the money supply, but they CANNOT afford to raise rates as the US would be unable to service her debts! Is the Fed helping or harming the economy? My opinion is the Fed is destroying the dollar and America's near-term future in the process. We must realize that market intervention is magnifying, not solving the problems that caused the crisis! The Fed's actions have only delayed and worsened the original financial problems! What do you do in the meantime? There are many ways to protect you and your family from the potentially dangerous effects of inflation. Hard times for America do not necessarily mean hard times have to come for you. No matter what the economy is doing, no matter what the state of financial markets are there is always a strategy available that can make you money. The key is to recognize opportunities wherever they may be and, more importantly, detach from old investment strategies that are no longer working. Here is a list of inflation protection securities. Please note these are a list of suggestions. Many of these do not appear in our recommended portfolios at Faith-Based Investor as of yet. Please do your own research before purchasing. Here are six ETFs and six stocks poised to do well if inflation takes off: 6 ETFS IShares US TIP Securities (NYSE: TIP) IShares COMEX Gold (NYSE: IAU) IShares Silver (NYSE: SLV) Proshares Ultrashort 20+ Year Treasury (NYSE: TBT) Proshares Ultrashort 7-10 yr Treasury (NYSE: PST) SPDR Gold (NYSE: GLD) 6 STOCKS Silver Wheaton (NYSE: SLW) BHP Billiton Limited (NYSE: BHP) Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (NYSE: FCX) North American Pallidum (NYSE: PAL) Rio Tinto PLC (NYSE: RTP) Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) Let's be realistic!

2011-03-27,"March 28, 2011: Everyone's World and Your Permanent Portfolio","Last May, I suggested that for safety a Permanent Portfolio be considered as investors continue to be held hostage to fickle politicians and unpredictable events here and abroad. I designed a Permanent Portfolio using low cost ETFs to closely replicate the portfolio of Michael Cuggino's 5-star Permanent Portfolio Fund. The goal of this ETF mix? To retain absolute value and rise approximately 2% more than the Citigroup 3-month U.S. Treasury Bill index, re-balanced semi-annually or annually.As Michael Cuggino has massaged the Permanent Portfolio Fund from his predecessors, Harry Browne and Terry Coxon, to reflect different investment avenues and long term trends,I have done likewise for my current ETF Permanent Portfolio. This begs the question, why adjust the allocation and moving parts of a permanent portfolio when it is designed to be permanent? The answer is that the world is changing at warp speed compared to fifty or even five years ago. Investment products better reflecting the world are available to capture long trends while defending against your best intentioned stock selections going haywire (generally, when you least expect it). Whereas the original Browne portfolio relied on stock warrants, physical possession of precious metal to be held in Switzerland and Swiss Francs in banknotes, and Mr. Cuggino's supposition of pure U.S. Dollar assets to be worth 30% of the portfolio, I have attempted to fine tune the portfolio further using low-cost ETFs and acknowledging that, quite possibly (but not certainly), the U.S. dominant position in the world and concurrently the U.S. Dollar are heading south with dispatch. This would favor such Asian banking and corporate areas such as Singapore.The investor certainly wants exposure to areas presently out of favor. The intent of the ETF Permanent Portfolio is to protect against placing too many eggs in what the best investment basket du jour is for a given cycle.

Having a permanent portfolio anchor allows the investor to place more focused bets on areas of conviction. While you may agree or disagree with my selections, the concept itself may spur you to elect this strategy. Having a grip on the geo-political landscape becomes more important day by day. A service such as STRATOR should become a tool in equal measure to your daily perusal through the stocks charts and gurus.The author has no position in any of the above stock ETFs or has no profit relationship with STRATFOR."
2011-03-30,Relax: Doing Less With Your Investments,"Doing Less With Your Investments March 28, 2011 by Nanette Byrnes In his latest Behavior Gap Newsletter, Carl Richards nails that feeling of confusion that comes when we learn first hand that “past performance is not a guarantee of future results.” Investing isn't like hiring a basketball coach, Richards argues, but rather like planting an oak tree:“You never plant a tree and then pull it out every time the wind blows just to check the roots.” He also quotes this gem from Warren Buffett: “Benign neglect, bordering on sloth, remains the hallmark of our investment process.” Why We Should Do Less With our Investments In his book Wise Investing Made Simpler Larry Swedroe makes a similar point using a study conducted by a trio of academics. Edwin J. Elton and Martin J. Gruber of New York University, and Christopher R. Blake of Fordham University, examined 43 401(k) plans from 1994 through 1999. Over those five years, the 401(k) plans added 215 new fund options for participants and dropped 45 funds from their plans. The funds added had a strong track record. Those that were dropped had poor recent performance. The professors soon discovered that the new funds promptly underperformed those that had been given the heave-ho. That brought the overall quality of the offerings down. Making matters worse, participants in the plans constantly chased performance by shifting money into last quarter's top performers, the study notes. Give Your Money A Chance To Grow The argument Richards, Swedroe, and others make is simple. Having put thought and effort into setting up their investments, investors need to give them a chance to grow. That doesn't mean you can't appreciate their beauty and even check in on their performance now and again, but successful long-term investing requires patience. If you have ideas for setting the right balance between enlightened remove and dangerous neglect, chime in.

2011-05-04,"Mexico Gets Gold Fever (IAU, GLD, FXM)","Mexico is the latest emerging market nation to flock to gold as a means to diversify away from the floundering dollar. The central bank of Mexico bought nearly 100 tons of gold in February and March. This ranks as one of the largest purchases by a central bank in recent history. Mexico did not publicly announce the purchase. However, the nation did report it on its own balance sheet and to the International Monetary Fund's statistics on international reserves. The nation, along with other fast growing emerging market economies, such as China, India and Russia, have all made large additions to their gold reserves in recent months. Unlike the BRIC nation's purchases, Mexico's could be considered one of the most rapid accumulations on record. According to the World Gold Council, the 78.5 tons bought in March, is the largest monthly purchase by a central bank in at least a decade. For investors, this just highlights the dollar's decline as the world's reserve currency. Adding either the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) or the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) still makes long term sense. Additionally, the CurrencyShares Mexican Peso Trust (NYSE: FXM) might make an interesting play on this news. With Mexico's decision to add gold to its Forex reserves, the Peso should continue to strengthen. Disclosure: Author is Long IAU"
2011-05-17,"George Soros Cashes in on Gold Trade, Cuts Holdings by $750 Million+ (GLD, IAU)","George Soros' fund Soros Fund Management has cashed in on an enormous gold trade, securities filings show Monday. The billionaire investor's fund cut its holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Turst (NYSE: IAU) by more than $750 million, according the the December filing. A Reuters report notes that The gold ETF positions were valued at over $774 million at the end of the fourth quarter, by far the firm's largest position at that time. At the end of the first quarter, the remaining gold position was worth less than $7 million. Spot gold peaked above $1,500 an ounce in recent weeks, but has since receded below that mark. Many investors speculated in the boom, but some economists point to a bubble-like environment. Still, with inflation and global economic uncertainty an emerging concern, gold is likely to keep its appeal. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Soros had sold gold and silver investments built up over the previous year."
2011-06-10,"S&P Raises Gold Price Outlook, But With A Catch","Analysts at Standard & Poor's raised their near-term outlook on gold prices by $100 an ounce this past Thursday. S&P expects gold to trade at $1,200 per ounce for the remainder of this year. Price estimations for 2012 were raised from $1,000 to $1,100 per ounce, with 2013 and beyond now hitting $900 per ounce. Previous price targets were $900 for 2012, $700 for 2014, and $600 for 2015. What's interesting is that S&P's estimations for gold prices are about $300 lower that today's current prices. S&P Analysts Andrey Nikolaev and Mark Puccia expressed concerns with the fact that about half of the demand for gold comes from financial investors.” The pair cited that “The key risk remains a sharp decrease in investor demand as the uncertainty in the global economy declines.” While S&P's forecast for higher gold prices seems spot-on, the price targets themselves seem a little off. If anything, there's been an increase in uncertainty as of late. Lower consumer confidence, stubbornly high unemployment, and not to mention the Euro-zones woes. The central banks of China, India and Mexico have been buying gold due to the excessive supply of dollars created since the credit crisis began. The future role of the greenback as the world's reserve currency is also in question. For investors, that means gold prices will stay firm for quite some time. Adding gold on any days of weakness seems like a prudent choice. There are plenty of ways to gain exposure including the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), PowerShares DB Gold (NYSE: DGL), and the ETFS Physical Asian Gold Shares (NASDAQ: AGOL).

2011-07-05,Hide In The Swiss Franc,"With concerns about the U.S. debt ceiling and European bailouts continuing to persist, many investors are looking for ways to hedge against the falling euro and greenback. Gold has become a popular investment for many, but it's not the only game in town. One answer could lie with the Swiss Franc. Over the past six months the currency has gained more than 15% vs. the U.S. dollar. Switzerland's conservative national accounting coupled with its gold reserves has helped reaffirm the currencies status as a safe-haven. With the Fed signaling more of the same, and with Euro-zone debt problems continuing to plague the markets, exposure to the Swiss franc is prudent. For investors, the easiest way to add the currency to a portfolio is through the CurrencyShares Swiss Franc Trust (NYSE: FXF). While much of the real upside for Franc could be gone, the currency makes sense as a hedge. Investors looking to diversify away from gold should give the Franc and FXF a go.

2011-07-28,Part I: Top 20 ETFs Under $20,"In the first of a four-part series, Benzinga takes a look at five of the top-20 ETFs currently trading under $20. Obviously, to compile the list we focused on ETFs trading under $20, but other factors that were heavily considered include volatility (i.e. how good these ETFs are as short term trades) and the potential for members of the list to eventually surpass the $20 barrier. Without further ado, here are the first five members of Benzinga's “20 Under $20” list. 1) Global X FTSE ASEAN 40 ETF (NYSE: ASEA): ASEA made its debut back in February and after spending several months flying under investors' radars and delivering only tepid performance along with weak volume, this multi-country play has started to get things headed in the right direction. ASEA's recent performance in the face of the European debt crisis and the U.S. debt ceiling mess is admirable and the ETF is even positive over the past five trading days, no small feat. In recent weeks, volume in ASEA has more than doubled and assets under management have jumped from just over $4 million to nearly $21 million. The ETF is starting to look sporty for the back half of this year. 2) Guggenheim Solar ETF (NYSE: TAN): TAN and its counterpart, the Market Vectors Solar Energy ETF (NYSE: KWT), both of which trade under $10, have been hammered this year due to uncertainty surrounding European government subsidies for solar projects and poor profit guidance from their constituents. At this point, the negative news flow should be backed into TAN's share price and the trade is simple: A move below $6 means it's probably time to bail. 3) Global X Uranium ETF (NYSE: URA): Speaking of negative news flow, we present perhaps the most controversial ETF of 2011. If it's not the most controversial, then URA is easily one of the worst non-leveraged performers. That makes this ultimate potential play. Truth be told, URA has been showing some signs of life recently and cleared its 50-day moving average a few days ago. The longer the words “Japan” and “nuclear” stay out of the headlines, the more time URA has to pare its 2011 losses. 4) PowerShares DB Agriculture Double Long ETN (NYSE: DAG): There is plenty of leveraged fare out there languishing below $20, but that's not bad when it comes to DAG. It's actually a gift for short-term traders. With an ATR of 0.5 and the volatility of an ag play, DAG is a sound bet for short-term commodities gains. 5) iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU): IAU is no slouch when its comes to AUM with over $8.1 billion, but that is still well behind the total boasted by the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), one of IAU's primary rivals. IAU undercuts GLD on expenses and is also backed by holdings of physical gold like its bigger competitor. Taking part in gold's uptrend for less than $16 is a pretty inviting prospect."

2011-08-12,A Look Ahead: Next Week's ETFs To Watch,"What a week. That's likely the mantra of exasperated traders and investors everywhere as for the first time ever, the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw intraday moves of 400 points or more on four consecutive days. Not to be outdone, the S&P 500 moved in ranges exceeding 4% from Monday through Thursday, making Friday's 0.53% gain seem docile by comparison. From a psychological standpoint, it was good for the bulls that stocks closed higher heading into the weekend, but in an environment fraught with headline risk, it's probably too early to get to excited. With those words of caution, let's have a look at next week's ETFs to watch. iShares Comex Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU): Some are speculating that if gold pulls back to $1,650 an ounce, that will represent an end to the yellow metal's bull market. That remains to be seen because every significant pullback in gold over the past two years has been a real buying opportunity. Yes, IAU is a great trading vehicle, but it's also a great long-term holding for those that can withstand gold's near-term gyrations. iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment Index Fund (NYSE: IEZ): Sniff around for some ETF bargins and its hard not to have an oil services ETF or two on that list. Here's what we like about IEZ: Buy it at $55.50 and support is firm at $50, so that means exchanging $5.50 of downside for almost $15 of upside as the ETF will likely flirt with $70 again later this year. CurrencyShares Swiss Franc Trust (NYSE: FXF): Intervention threats and margin hikes have damaged the Swissie in a big way, but investors still need a safe haven in addition to gold and they aren't going to find it in dollars or euros. FXF is another buy on the dip candidate. iShares MSCI Italy Index Fund (NYSE: EWI): Italy seems to be taking this austerity thing seriously as evidenced by headlines that crossed Friday afternoon. Whether or not that boosts EWI remains to be seen. Short this ETF if it violates support at $12.50. Market Vectors Indonesia ETF (NYSE: IDX): IDX put in a performance this week that was certainly less bad than a broad swath of other emerging markets ETFs and if you're not adventurous enough to jump in right now, definitely put IDX on your watch list because it will be a leader among emerging markets ETFs if the market rebounds."
2011-08-15,Options Brief: The iShares COMEX Gold Trust,"Shares of The iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) are lower on the session by 0.41%, trading at $16.97. Overall put volume is now running at 2.90x the daily average, with 4% of all puts traded being purchases on the offer. 1,756 contracts have traded on the session so far. The iShares COMEX Gold Trust seeks to replicate net of expenses the day-to-day movement of the price of gold bullion."

2011-08-25,ETFs For Jackson Hole ,"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is slated to speak from Jackson Hole, Wyoming on Friday in what is usually supposed to be a benign affair, but as was the case at the time of last year's get-together in the Cowboy State, global equity markets are teetering on the brink thanks to Europe's sovereign debt woes, slack employment growth in the U.S. and concerns over emerging markets GDP growth and inflation. With the 2010 and 2011 situation sharing so many similarities, many are speculating (though hoping might be the better word) that the Fed will save the world with a third round of quantitative easing. While that would be good news for riskier assets, at least in the near-term, there has been no shortage of predictions noting that we will NOT be blessed with QE3. A legitimate case can be made for more QE and sound arguments can be made against, so we'll just have to wait and see what Bernanke says on Friday. In the meantime, these will be some of the ETFs worth keeping an eye on after the speech and heading into next week. Teucrium Corn ETF (NYSE: CORN): CORN is an ETF that is just looking for an excuse to really breakout if it hasn't done so already. The ETF has displayed exceptional relative strength in a market environment that should have been tricky for an ETF of this nature. Another round of quantitative easing would light a fire under plenty of commodities ETFs and probably send CORN soaring into the 50s. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD): We'll just go with the big kahuna, but the reality is, Bernanke's comments will impact GLD and rivals such as the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) one way or another. The gold slide will likely continue if we get QE3. If that scenario doesn't materialize, investors could easily view gold's recent pullback as the buying opportunity they've been eagerly waiting for. U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO): Another commodities play that stands to benefit immensely if QE3 comes to shore, USO was trading in the low 30s around the time QE2 was announced and soared higher from there. That said, history may not repeat itself as it is clear economic indicators are weak at this point and another round of quantitative easing may be too little too late to help oil prices in the near-term. The other side of the coin is bears haven't been able to force West Texas Intermediate Crude below $80. PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish (NYSE: UDN): More quantitative easing means the Fed will be running the printing presses even hotter than they have been and that would not be good news for the already imperiled U.S. dollar. UDN is facing some resistance at $29, but what is good news for stocks could also be good news for UDN and carry it above that key technical level."

2011-11-01,Last Chance to Buy Gold and Silver At a Discount,"We may own stocks we are writing about and may have position in these companies. We are not providing any investment advise on this blog and there is no solicitation to buy or sell any particular company here. We are simply sharing our thoughts for educational purposes only. Always consult with your qualified financial adviser before making any investment decisions. Last Thursday, October 20th, all was right inthe world. We had rallied past every key technical indicator; Europehad announced that they had come to an agreement to save the default of Greeceand Spain,andItaly and Portugal. Peace and prosperity would once aging reign in the landof Leonardo da Vinci,and the home of the greatest art ever created. The food is not too bad either. Last Friday I think everyone took the day off as there wassuch relief from the news out of Europe that no one wanted to jinks it byshowing up. Anyway it was Friday, Europe would be saved and we had a one monthclosing higher in the markets than we had in 40 years. We deserved a rest and Fridaywas the day. Well what a difference a day makes. Last week's passage of the Eurozone financial rescue plan impactedthe markets as traders continue to evaluate its worth. The markets are also whisperingand watching the Fed for any news about a QE3 initiative but the Feds steadfastlydeny any such plan. Initialrelief over Europe's latest attempt to end its debt crisis faded fast yesterday(Monday) as investors fretted about the plan'slack of detail and grew more skeptical about Italy's turnaround effort. Oneday after European leaders announced a series of measures aimed in part atenticing investors back to the region's debt markets, bond buyers demandedhigher yields on Italianand Spanish debt. An auction of new Italian bonds was met with weak demand,forcing the nation to pay higher interest rates than in previous sales. Theresponse from bond markets underscores how challenging it will be for Europeanleaders to convince financial markets that last Thursday's broad agreement issweeping enough to enable troubled countries such as Italy and Spain to worktheir way out from mountains of debt. The plan calls for beefing up theregion's bailout fund, recapitalizing banks and reducing Greece's debt burden. Atthis point, it's pretty obvious that this recoveryis fake. Since2009, this recovery has been manufactured, bought and paid for by governmentsfrom here to U.K. Lastweek, the latest EU bailout plan was just another example of a governmentthrowing money at their problems - and really putting off the real issues untilnext month or next year. Today,I want to show you two questions you need to answer so you can navigate these perilouseconomic waters this year. Ask yourself; isthe EconomyGrowing or Shrinking? Asa trader, I'm always watching to see if an economy is expanding or contracting?What is the trend of the market? Are the people in this country confident andassured or are they afraid that today may be their last day at work? Todetermine this, I found this chart of the U.S.GDP. A Government-Spending Induced Expansion HasCome! TheGDP figures show how the U.S. economy is faring. A negative number shows thatthere is an economic contraction. A positive number shows economic expansion. Rightnow, we're showing a positive number. But there's just one problem with that.It's not consumers who are promoting this growth - it's the government. Thepoliticians are stepping in to keep the economy afloat. Inother words, it's not a healthy expansion. So I don't expect it to last long. Thegood news: even if these numbers show a false start to the economy, they stillgive me some insight on what traders are seeing. Long-term, I'm still cautious.I know the enormous sums of money that the government spent to get theseeconomic results. They can't keep that up forever. Sooneror later, the economy will fall onto the backs of the consumer once again (aswe saw in early August). When this happens, we'll likely go back into aneconomic contraction. Thistells me that I can be bullishin the financial markets for short spurts here and there. But long-term, italso tells me to be cautious and to make sure I trade accordingly. Toprepare for this in my trading, I can always cut down my lot sizes for eachtrade. That will decrease my risk just in case the markets turn on me. Also,if my trades are comfortably above their breakeven point, I'll quickly move mystop-losses so I can assure myself of some gains just as soon as I feasiblycan. Finally, Should I Be On Offense or Defense? Thenext thing to keep in mind is whether you should be trading offensively ordefensively. Offensive plays involve buying the high-yielding equities and defensiveplays are the “safe haven” currencies like the gold and silver that tend torally when stocks fall. As of last week, the world markets seem to think thisEU bailout plan is enough to force a market rally for a while. Therefore, themood of the market can be favorable for taking a bit of risk during thesetimes. However,I would be cautious. Right now, we have economies drunk on tons of printedmoney. In my opinion, there's no way this EU plan will hold up in thelong-term. For now, it just looks like the EU is kicking the can down the roadonce again and saving their problems for another time. The problem is thatevery time we kick the can down the road it gets bigger and it's beginning tohurt my foot. Oncethe markets wise up to this fact, we'll see the hangover from all this. Stockswill fall - and that's when you'll want to bring out your defensive team. Yourdefensive team will include a basket of both physical and paper gold and silverETFs. Thetrick is knowing which ETFs to buy. I own a basket of safe gold and silver ETFs.I own SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD), Sprott Physical Gold Trust (PHYS), iSharesGold Trust ETF (IAU) and I bounce in and out of ProShares Ultra Gold ETF (UGL).I also own iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV), Sprott Physical Silver Trust (PSLV),Silver Wheaton (SLW) and I bounce in and out of ProShares Ultra Silver ETF (AGQ). Inconclusion if the market rallies gold and silver will move up modestly but ifthe markets will sell off (which is just a matter of time) gold and silver willbe our safe ports in the storm. And if the FOMC whispersQE3 gold and silver will go parabolic. So while the market stages its rally Iexpect gold and silver to sell off and I will be a buyer on any pullbacks."

A “no” vote could have caused chaos in theEuropean and global financial system by leading to a messy default on Greece'sdebt.Investorsand other European nations were shocked by Papandreou's announcement Mondaythat he would call a referendum on a financial rescue package worked out justlast week after months of negotiations between Greece and its internationallenders.TheDow lost 573 points the first two days of this week as investors feared thatEurope's plan to preserve its currency union was in jeopardy. Markets in theU.S. and Europe have been highly sensitive to headlines out of Europe asleaders there try to avoid a financial calamity. Investors have become fatiguedas various efforts to resolve the situation seem to continually run intotrouble.Todayit looks like a deal in Europe is more likely and that's making the marketpositive, but who knows what people will think tomorrow.**************************************************************Before I begin my essay ongold I must add that if Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou had put his package of austeritymeasures to a public vote, a “no” vote could have caused chaos in the Europeanand global financial system and gold would havegone parabolic. By abandoning his effort to put package of austerity measures to apublic vote and making it seem like it was the will of the government gold willsimply continue to rise. Gold is again being seen in Greece as anessential store of wealth, hedge against inflation and safehaven asset. This is not surprising given the political game of chickenthat has been played for the last several weeks.The fact that gold cannot default or gobankrupt unlike every single corporation, bank and government in the world ismaking it the safe haven of choice again. There is also the important fact thatunlike currencies and bonds, gold cannot be debased by bankers and centralbankers.Gold hasmarked a key Fibonaccipivot point and may now begin a new wave higher, potentially reaching $1900before year-end while on track to surpass the $2000 level in 2012.It's been several weeks since I've written about gold andwe have had a wild ride since the $1910-$1920 highs in August. At thetime, I wrote a major correction was imminent and we witnessed a $208 drop thattook place over just a few days. We covered our short at $1725 and thengold immediately rallied back to a double top at $1920. It then corrected backas scripted to 1531. Thatpullback to $1531 qualifies as a Fibonacci retracement of the 34-month rallyfrom $681 to $1920 and would also qualify for a price low for a fourth majorwave correction.Myinitial targets for the gold pullback were $1480-$1520 if the $1650 area wasviolated. Most recently, we have seen gold run up to $1681 (anotherFibonacci resistance zone) a few times and then back off to the low $1600's.Withthe recent push over $1681, we can now confirm the fourth wave is over at the$1531 lows and the fifth wave is likely in the very early stages, but beginningto build steam.Iwill say that we want to make sure the $1650-$1680 areas are defended by goldon any pullbacks in order for this forecast to remain valid. During thisfifth wave up, eventually we should see the $2380 range in gold, but it willnot take place overnight. Inthe next few months, I am looking for gold to attack the $1900 range, possiblyeven by year end, and then attack the $2000-plus range in 2012.Aswritten above, with all of the macro events in Europe changing on an almostdaily basis, the whipsaws in both the precious metals and equities markets aredifficult to forecast and trade for most investors. However, gold has beenmoving in defined Fibonacci and wave patterns for ten years now and if I'mright, has about three years left in a 13-year bull cycle.Belowis the updated weekly chart for gold. You can see prior lows as theyrelated to oversold indicators, and where we just came off the $1531 lows andits Fibonacci pivot along with the oversold indicators below. Lookfor gold to attack $1775 first, then $1800, $1840, and $1900 in the coming sixto ten weeks or so.The sharp recent correction in gold does not erase the long-termfundamental drivers that are still in place and likely to push the metal higher.So that begs thequestion how does the retail investor get into the gold trade now?Well a lot of this comes at a time frame when many people and muchthe public was underexposed to the gold move, from the move up from $1200,$1300, all the way to $1925. The sense is that gold will move too far too fast, and as aresult, people didn't want to chase the move. Well, the issues that helped goldrise are still very much in play.There is still a lot of question and concern about debasement ofcurrencies around the world. Overall, in terms of what various central banksare doing, that's still very much in play, and overall, peripheral andsovereign debt concerns have not been solved either.So we look at a way to have a real currency, a solid currency,gold still meets all those needs despite a short-term technical correction.In conclusion, I think that every retail investor needs to have20% of his portfolio in gold and silver. What they need is exposure to preciousmetals. The biggest threat to anyone in retirement is inflation. Especiallywith the debasement of the US dollar, this is still very big story. I suggestthat every retail investor buy something like the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), buy the iShares Gold Trust ETF(IAU), buy the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), Buy Newmont Mining (NEM), Goldcorp (GG) because besidesowning the underlying commodity, you want to own the companies that mine andproduce that commodity as well.That gives you somewhat of a diversified exposure,but buy owning the Market Vectors GoldMiners Trust (GDX), which is the gold miners ETF that consists of the top 30gold-mining stocks out there, you get all of the diversification you will needowning the mining stocks in one simple ETF. One thing is for sure, is the time to atleast put your toe in the water."
2011-11-07,"ETFs to Watch November 8, 2011","Here is the ETF Professor's ETF Watch List for Tuesday November 8, 2011. The iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) and the ETFS Physical Silver Shares (NYSE: SIVR) are both looking stout, but don't forget about the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). A couple of developed market plays for you: iShares MSCI Australia Index Fund (NYSE: EWA) and the Global X Norway ETF (NYSE: NORW). The SPDR S&P International Mid Cap ETF (NYSE: MDD) is starting to look interesting. Emerging markets plays of the day: Market Vectors Vietnam ETF (NYSE: VNM), Direxion Daily Latin America Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: LBJ) and the WisdomTree India Earnings ETF (NYSE: EPI).

2011-11-08,Bigger Isn't Always Better With ETFs: Part II,"Continuing with our series that we started on Monday, Benzinga continues to sift through the vast landscape known as the world of ETFs looking for funds that are large by assets under management, but that give up performance to comparable ETFs with smaller asset bases. On Monday, our search turned up a mix of sector funds, emerging markets ETFs and one developed markets play. Let's see what today's edition of “Bigger Isn't Always Better With ETFs” turns up. A Classic Rivalry: The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) was the first ETF backed by physical gold to come to market and remains the largest in that niche. It's also the second-largest ETF in the world with almost $72 billion in AUM. On the other hand, the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) has “just” $9.6 billion in AUM. The reality is GLD and IAU move in lockstep with each other and basically do the same thing, so this isn't about performance. It's about fees. IAU has an expense ratio of 0.25%. GLD's 0.4%. The choice appears clear. An Oily Proposition: For all the controversy surrounding the U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) and how vulnerable this ETF is to contango, it remains popular for one reason or another and has over $1 billion in AUM. If you must dance with an ETF like USO, don't make it USO. Make it the U.S. Brent Oil Fund (NYSE: BNO), which is USO's equivalent for Brent Crude. A lot of governments and oil producers are going to Brent as their benchmark because of the wide spread between Brent and West Texas Intermediate. That's a boon for BNO, which is up more than 24% year-to-date compared to a negative run for USO. Another Golden Play: The conversation about gold mining ETFs usually goes in this order. 1) The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). 2) The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF. 3) Dead air. Well, we're willing to bet a lot of investors didn't know the Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG) has performed in line with GDX year-to-date and clobbered GDXJ. Now you know. Chinese Technology: We previously mentioned the Guggenheim China Technology ETF (NYSE: CQQQ) as an ideal way of playing high-flying Chinese tech stocks, if you dared. CQQQ has almost $28 million in AUM. Not bad for a niche fund like this, but that's dwarfed by the $177.1 million in AUM held by the Guggenheim China Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: HAO). Yet, CQQQ has trounced HAO in terms of performance this year. BRIC Battle: Let's make this simple. The iShares MSCI BRIC Index Fund (NYSE: BKF) has almost $800 million in AUM. That's nearly 60% better than what the Guggenheim BRIC ETF (NYSE: EEB). Similar funds to be sure, but not similar performance. EEB has easily outpaced BKF year-to-date AND it has the lower expense ratio at 0.6% compared to 0.69% for the iShares offering. Bull case: It's easy to be bullish on gold right now. In the case of the other funds, it will take non-gold commodities and emerging markets coming back into style to juice returns. QE3 anyone? Bear case: No QE3. Oil falls. Emerging markets get smashed and gold loses its safe haven status."
2011-11-09,The Gold Barometer,"Every trader in the world follows gold and they should. When gold rallies, or bounces higher it will usually signal that inflation is being pumped into the stock market. The opposite is true when gold declines and sells off, it will signal that the stock market indexes are deflating and will trade lower. Gold is the ultimate barometer of the amount of stimulus that the central banks are creating and putting into the market. Traders can easily see the move in gold this morning. Once gold started to bounce off of the morning lows the major stock market indexes also caught a bid higher. Obviously, the U.S. Dollar Index sold off dramatically, but that is typical when gold moves higher. Gold is leading the stock markets in both directions. For example, yesterday gold was weak despite the stock market rallying higher, that decline in gold at the end of the day told us that there was a better than average chance that the stock market would come under pressure today. Sure enough, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is trading lower by 240.00 points this morning. Traders must watch the action in gold. Some good gold vehicles to follow include the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), iShares Comex Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), and the Sprott Physical Gold Trust (NYSE: PHYS). These equities all follow the spot price of gold very closely. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"
2011-11-13,"ETFs to Watch November 14, 2011","Here is the ETF Professor's ETF Watch List for Monday November 14, 2011. The iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment Index Fund (NYSE: IEZ) is looking strong. Stick with gold in the form of the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) or the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Another day, another opportunity to make money with the iShares Italy Index Fund (NYSE: EWI). Emerging markets plays of the day: iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ), Market Vectors India Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: SCIF) and the ProShares UltraShort Emerging Markets (NYSE: EEV). Forex play of the day: CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust (NYSE: FXA). Bond play of the day: Market Vectors High-Yield Muni ETF (NYSE: HYD)."
2011-11-23,Five ETF Rivalries to Watch in 2012,"Avid fans and observers of the exchange-traded products industry know that there are plenty of ETFs from issuer A that do the same thing as a fund from issuer B. The proliferation of so many “me too” ETFs means there are some neat ETF rivalries to watch. And when it comes to those rivalries, some are known while others fly under the radar. The competition between the Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: VWO) and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM is obvious as is the tussle between the SPDR Gold Shares and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Those examples aside, let's look at five ETF rivalries that will be of interest to investors in 2012. Oil Rivalry The iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment Index Fund (NYSE: IEZ) and the Oil Services HOLDRs (AMEX: OIH) represent one of the more compelling ETF rivalries at the sector level and this rivalry should be all the more interesting next year as OIH becomes a Market Vectors ETF. Given the sector these ETFs track, we'll call this Texas vs. Texas A&M. Who Will Shine With Silver? Silver miners that is. Since its debut in April 2010, the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) has had the market on silver miners ETFs cornered because it has been the only ETF tracking some of these stocks. SIL won't be lonely much longer as iShares has filed plans for its own silver miners ETF. Of course, there's no guarantee the iShares fund will ever come to market, and even it does, SIL's first-to-market advantage cannot be underestimated. Beep Beep. The First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index (Nasdaq: CARZ) and the Global X Auto ETF (NYSE: VROM) both came to market this year with CARZ beating VROM out of the gate by about a week. However, VROM has $4.5 million in assets under management compared to $3.3 million for CARZ. Assuming the economy, namely the jobs picture, improves, this could turn out to be a nifty ETF battle. Given the sector, we'll call this Michigan vs. Michigan State. Going With Gold Next year, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) will celebrate its sixth birthday. It should also celebrate the fact that its dominance among ETFs tracking large-cap gold miners has led to AUM haul over $9.2 billion. Like SIL, GDX might be getting a rival in the form of an iShares gold miners ETF that the firm has filed plans for. GDX has a first-to-market advantage that has endured a couple of challengers to date. Will that trend continue against iShares? We'll call this the Gold Cup. Battle For Nigeria While there isn't a Nigeria-specific ETF on the market today, both Van Eck, parent company of Market Vectors, and Global X have filed plans to bring Nigeria ETFs to market. We're working on the premise that neither will come to market this and both will debut next year. To be clear, we do not know when either will debut. Given that both funds are likely to be heavy on energy names, this battle could come down to which ETF has the lower expense ratio, particularly if both ETFs come to market in a condensed period of time as CARZ and VROM did."
2011-11-30,Twelve For '12: Commodities ETFs to Watch In The New Year,"On the heels of our popular “Eleven For '11” series that we ran late last year, we're upping the ante by one this time around. No, it's not the 12 days of Christmas, though some might say it is a 12-round title fight. We're talking about looking at 12 ETFs across various sectors that merit consideration for 2012 and we're getting the ball rolling with some beta by looking at commodities funds. Always volatile, sometimes controversial, commodities have taken on a new role in the lexicon of ordinary investors thanks in large part to the evolution of the ETF industry. But those that end the discussion with gold and oil funds are missing out because there are many more potentially profitable opportunities for the taking in the commodities world. So let's get on with looking at 12 commodities ETFs (and ETNs) that are worth looking at in 2012. iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU): We didn't say ignore gold altogether, did we? After breaking through the $1,900 area in September, gold now resides well below $1,800. Concerned? Don't be. All of the issues that have fueled gold's run – Europe's debt woes, Uncle Sam's debt problem, a weak dollar – remain. Morgan Stanley said in a note today gold could average $2,200 an ounce next year. That makes IAU a steal at current levels. ETFS Physical Silver Shares (NYSE: SIVR): Maybe more volatile and easily more controversial than gold, silver will be in the spotlight again next year. Whether or not that's a good thing remains to be seen. As we noted earlier, considering that SIVR does the same thing as the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), SIVR is the better bet due to its lower expense ratio. Most 2012 price forecasts imply significant upside from current levels. United States Copper Fund (NYSE: CPER): Until we get an ETF backed by physical copper, the new United States Copper Fund will have to do. Dr. Copper is always a useful tell on the strength of major global economies. Of course, that has meant some tough times for the red metal as of late, but assuming we see more quantitative easing from global central banks, copper will rise. iPath DJ-UBS Livestock TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: COW): We haven't been shy about calling COW a dud this year. After all, cattle and hog prices were soaring this year and the experts were talking about how the newly affluent in emerging markets were eating more high-quality meat. All the while COW was struggling. We'll give credit where it's due and acknowledge COW is up 2.6% year-to-date. Perhaps bigger things await in 2012 if emerging markets return to glory. ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL): The only ETF devoted exclusively to physical palladium holdings is PALL. When things are good, they're very good for this ETF. And when they're bad, they're very bad, a fact highlighted by PALL's fall to around $55 in October from $85 in August. The big catalysts with palladium are auto sales in the U.S. and China and Russian production, or lack thereof. Get both of those things going in the metal's favor, and PALL could easily see the $80 area again. United States Brent Oil Fund (NYSE: BNO): If you're going to dabble in futures-backed exchange-traded products that track oil, do it with one that offers a play on Brent, not West Texas Intermediate. Yes, BNO should be on your radar for 2012, but if the ETF breaks $79, it could run back to its 52-week high of $84.19 this year. PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund (NYSE: DBA): Agricultural commodities have seen their share of drama this year, most of it bad. That is true, but two things should be remembered. First, corn, soybeans, etc. will not be left behind in a QE-induced commodities rally. Second, the long-term global food consumption and production trends are scary and that's very good for DBA. PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund (NYSE: DBB): All of a sudden the PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund's chart looks pretty good as the ETF now has room to tack on 10% or more in effort to get back to the 200-day line. What DBB really needs for a sustainable rally is good economic fundamentals from major global economies. That will prompt increased aluminum and copper demand as well as higher use of other industrial metals. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): An equity-based play or two belong on this list and why not start off with a gold miners ETF? Precious metals mining stocks and ETFs have been under fire this year for lagging the metals they extract from the earth, but that situation has been improving recently. Valuations on large-cap gold miners look compelling right now and if gold's bull run continues next year, and it should, GDX looks like a smart way to play that move. Global X Fertilizers/Potash ETF (NYSE: SOIL): Sure you can dance with other agribusiness ETFs, but one that is entirely devoted to fertilizer stocks actually makes a lot of sense. If the broader market improves next year, high-beta stocks like fertilizer and potash stocks will rally. And if you like an ETF like DBA, than the Global X Fertilizers/Potash ETF makes a lot sense as an equity-based alternative. Teucrium Corn ETV (NYSE: CORN): CORN has been a big a disappointment lately and the fund barely took place in Thursday's big rally. Relief may come in the form of election year politics that will likely see no smart candidate go to places like Iowa and Minnesota and say he or she wants to curb ethanol production. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP): XOP is a great tool for short-term traders with a volatile nature that is reminiscent of a leveraged ETF. The ETF's low expense ratio and exposure to integrated oil stocks is a plus for conservative investors. Not to mention, XOP is a play on just about every U.S. shale formation, rising oil prices and the fund is full of potential buyers and sellers in the energy M&A game."
2011-12-03,Can Santa Ben Start The Santa Rally?,"Santa Ben and his global central banker elves showered the financial world with early Christmas cheer last week and now investors wonder if this might be the start of the seasonal Santa Rally. It's early December and the Christmas decorations are up in the malls and thoughts are turning to holiday meals and presents under the tree. Most investors are also hoping for the anticipated Santa Rally to round out a difficult year, despite continued (permanent) European debt crisis woes and last week's American Airlines Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. It was a tough November, yet all of the doom and gloom instantly disappeared when Santa Ben and his troop of central bank elves came to the rescue last week, triggering the largest surge for the DJIA since 2009 (7%). Has Santa Ben (and his elves) come to rescue the Santa Rally? The anticipated “Santa Rally” typically occurs because of the high volumes of cash that flow into the marketplace due to holiday shopping and investors closing their trades before the end of the year for tax purposes. It's further fueled by institutions and hedge fund manager hoping to juice their returns to make sure that bigger year end bonuses await in their stockings on Christmas morning. The stock market often goes vertical during late December as market players position themselves for the seasonal “January Effect” which continues the Santa Rally into the first month of the New Year. However, this holiday season is off to a little different sort of start as the European debt crisis has largely driven markets this year and unfortunately so far has delayed any hopes of Santa spreading his good cheer this year. But wait! Last week Dr. Bernanke and his world-wide team of Central Bank elves put on their Santa Hats and injected more free money into the market place! In a joint venture between the central banks of the United States, England, Switzerland, Japan, Canada and China, enormous liquidity was injected into the financial system to loosen credit conditions and effectively make U.S. dollars easier to get for credit strapped European banks. Couple that Christmas candy with this Tuesday's Euro Summit meeting and Santa and his elves have likely laid the groundwork for a powerful Christmas rally. So where does Dr. Ben's Santa hat leave ETF investors? As always, ETF investors can profit from a bull or bear market and whatever market conditions we might see unfold as we head into the holidays.

2011-12-09,Iran: Buy and Store! War is Looming!,"Reuters reported Thursday that speculations of war are disrupting the lives of concerned Iranians as they begin to mentally and financially prepare for the onset of a military conflict with the West. According to the Reuters article, tensions are rising after Iranian students stormed two British diplomatic compounds in response to new sanctions that were imposed on Iran owing to the UN nuclear agency's suggesting that Iran is working to make nuclear weapons. While Iran and the US have engaged in saber rattling recently with respect to the prospect of Iran building a nuclear weapon, the likelihood of the conflict rising to the level of military action appears to be increasing. Pres. Barack Obama said on Thursday that, No options off the table means I'm considering all options thereby suggesting that military action is a possibility. According to the Reuters article, customers passing through a market in Tehran could hear a nut seller shouting, Buy and store! War is looming! One 82-year-old Iranian named Zahra Farzaneh stated that, In case of an attack ... we will be imprisoned inside the country ... the borders will be closed. Another Iranian named Hossein Alaie said, After the first strike the country and then the whole region will turn into a war zone. They will destroy everything. I am stockpiling goods and have told my relatives to do so. According to the article, aside from keeping a store of essential goods, some Iranians are selling jewelry, withdrawing cash, and selling securities in order to buy dollars as the demand for hard currency increases. As those in Iran mentally prepare for war, The cost of many basic necessities like bread, meat and transportation has shot up. While some Iranians fear that war is coming, the Drudge Report featured an article recently from the National Journal written by Michael Hirsch boldly asking the question, Has the war with Iran already begun? Hirsch suggests that recent incidents in Iran including the capture of a US spy drone and alleged explosions at supposed Iranian nuclear facilities demonstrate that both Israel and the US are engaging in cloak-and-dagger activities. Hirsch: Asked whether the United States, in cooperation with Israel, was now engaged in a covert war against Iran's nuclear program that may include the Stuxnet virus, the blowing-up of facilities and the assassination or kidnaping of scientists, one recently retired US official privy to up-to-date intelligence would not deny it. On Thursday, Iranian state television ran footage of two men wearing military uniforms walking around and inspecting the alleged captured US spy drone. According to the Washington Post, beneath the drone ran posters saying, We'll trample America underfoot. Also on Thursday, the UK's Daily Mail reported that a US official confirmed that the spy drone is of the US. Daily Mail: 'Yep, that's it - it's intact,' a source told Fox News. 'This is a big prize in terms of technology.' Even so, as the Daily Mail's Mark Duell commented, much mystery surrounds the alleged capture of the spy plane as the drone in the footage was in near mint condition thereby contradicting Iran's claim it was shot down. As the drum beat of war between Iran and the West appears to be getting louder, where Iranians may be stocking up on essential goods, Americans may be concerned about how a war with Iran would influence the price of oil and gas prices at home. Where Iran could attempt to hit US targets in the Gulf and close up the Strait of Hormuz thereby disrupting the flow of oil, a war with Iran would most likely substantially increase oil prices. Is it likely that the West will go to war with Iran? Although a 2010 CBS News poll suggested that war-weary Americans would be hesitant to go to war with Iran, the electoral advantage of being a wartime president could possibly benefit Pres. Obama in the 2012 election. Of course, the coin has two sides as voters may get frustrated with the nation being involved in an unpopular war. That being the case, one has to think that $5 to $10 per gallon gasoline would bring the US economy to a grinding halt -- and just when it was starting to look as if the economy was beginning to improve. There are possibly those who think that a war with Iran could boost the US economy, but I think that such a venture done in the spirit of economic growth would be reckless. As Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises observed, War prosperity is like the prosperity that an earthquake or a plague brings. As traders and speculators may see a financial opportunity in rising oil prices, it is important to note that saber rattling and the exchange of political zings between the West and Iran have been going on for a while. Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has long criticized the West while relaying an apocalyptic vision of the world. Even back in 2005, Ahmadinejad said that Israel must be wiped off the map. It is also important for traders and speculators to note that, as we saw in 2008, a significant rise in oil prices can burst. Owing to the interplay of commerce and energy usage, there appear to be practical limits to how high oil and gas prices can go before the economy simply shuts down. That being the case, rising oil prices could very well prove to be a blessing for traders and speculators while being a curse for US consumers. Recently, Jim Cramer spoke of how we appear to be entering an era of expensive oil. CNBC's Drew Sandholm: With oil prices continuing to rise and given the increased tension in Iran, the 'Mad Money' host recommends owning an oil stock. Investors can currently get them at discount, too, because oil stocks have been hammered lately. Cramer speculated on Nov. 29, If oil hasn't come down yet, isn't it safe to presume that it might never come down? While Iranians may be stocking up on cash, nuts, and bread, in the West traders, speculators, and investors may be wanting to stock up on oil. Cramer: The only stocks that consistently react positively to good news these days? The oil and gas stocks. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that oil prices will rise in the future owing to military action in Iran might want to consider the following trades: Check out iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return (NYSE: OIL), ENSCO PLC (NYSE: ESV), and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP).Bearish:Traders who believe that war with Iran could send oil prices so far through the roof to the point that it decimates consumer demand thereby effectively shutting down the economy may consider alternate positions:Check out SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD), iShares Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: IAU), and silver coins & bars.Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-12-14,Safe Haven No More: ETFs For Gold's Decline,"Paradise has been lost. At least for the gold bugs. We're not saying the decade-long bull run in gold is over, but there are ominous signs to that affect. Take the case of the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) for example. The world's second-largest ETF by assets is below its 200-day moving average on its weekly chart for the first time since early 2009. The point and figure chart for the ETF indicates a decline to $136 is possible and, not surprisingly, the outlook is no better for GLD rivals such as the iShares Comex Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Maybe the yellow metal is taking a rest. Maybe it's about to reverse trend and enter a legitimate bear market. Time will tell and we'll tell you about some of the ETFs you need to know about for an extended gold slide. Potential Winners Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST): Apparently, we were ahead of the game by touting this ETF back in September. Back then, DUST was double leveraged, but it recently added some juice and moved to the triple leveraged neighborhood. Put it this way, if gold mining stocks and ETFs struggled to rise with gold going higher, they're not going to go up with gold going down. DUST has a lot of upside in it, perhaps even 10% over the next few days. PowerShares Dollar Bullish (NYSE: UUP): We're having a hard time believing it, too. Two endorsements for UUP in the same day. Well, if gold isn't a safe have right now, then what is? Obviously the U.S. dollar. ProShares UltraShort Silver (NYSE: ZSL): The experts say gold drags silver higher. Logically, that means it would drag the white metal lower. The bad news is the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) and the ETFS Physical Silver Shares (NYSE: SIVR) need no downside assistance as both are down more than 23% in the past three months. That means it's time to dial up ZSL, which can ring up gains of 5% or more in a single day. WisdomTree Managed Futures ETF (NYSE: WDTI): As we've been telling you lately, the WisdomTree Managed Futures ETF has short positions in gold and silver futures. Obviously, that makes this unheralded ETF worth a look here. Potential Losers Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ): Reference the part on DUST for information, but consider this as well: If GDXJ violates support at $24, its probably going to $20 for the first time since early 2010. By the way, this probably isn't the environment for small-caps of any stripe. CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust (NYSE: FXA): The Aussie dollar is a commodity currency and the commodity it has shown a historical correlation with is gold. Typically, gold moves first and the Aussie dollar responds. That could mean more declines for FXA are on the way, especially if support at $98 is violted. iShares MSCI South Africa Index Fund (NYSE: EZA): EZA did not make our list of emerging markets ETFs to watch next year. Now we might have a really good reason for that. South Africa is a major gold miner and EZA has been acting like a mining ETF, slumping as gold has gone up. In fact, EZA is down almost 21% year-to-date even as the SPDR Gold Shares is up more than 15%. That's not a good sign. Action Items: Traders that believe gold is going to continue falling should consider the following trades: Long DUST, long the PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ), long UUP. Traders that are willing to bet on a rebound for gold should consider the following trades: Long IAU, Short ZSL, long the ETFS Physical PM Basket Shares (NYSE: GLTR).

Despite the pain and suffering caused by the gold sell-off last week, there are still reasons to believe that it is too early to write off gold completely. First let us take a look at how Gold performed last week: not good.

First, Europe must not tank the world, and secondly, the U.S. economy must not stumble on its way to what is, at best, a mediocre recovery. If these two events do not happen, then investors have every right to write off Gold unless (until?) the fiat currencies fail. If however, the US or Europe places any more strain on financial markets, gold will likely be everyone's currency of choice. Dr. Bernanke and Company stand ready with the printing presses if the U.S. economy slows or things blow up in Europe. Gold's decline last week was directly related to the Fed's inaction and it's easy to foresee a scenario in early 2012 where the Fed would embark on QE3. A recession in Europe and a marked slowdown in China will most likely ripple onto our shores with slower domestic growth and any action in this direction would be a boost to gold. Additionally, a European collapse would have potentially far reaching and disastrous implications. Things are definitely not going well for “Team Merkozy” and if they do not get their fiscal house in order to investors' liking, the entire Euro Zone could crumble and gold would become a “safe haven” as it usually does during times of financial stress and uncertainty. A look at gold exchange traded funds tells us that holdings have been reduced, however, still remain near record highs at more than $120 Billion. Options traders also remain bullish on the yellow metal with significant positions in call options extending into March. Furthermore, central banks continue their widespread purchases of gold which will also serve to support prices going forward. Bottom line: Gold (NYSEARCA:IAU) NYSEARCA:GLD) is in a bear market, having dropped below its 200 day moving average and sporting double digit losses from its recent peak, however, many fundamental factors point to the potential for a resumption of the bull market as we move into 2012.

2011-12-23,Want to Invest like Ron Paul? Buy Gold,"Three words seem to sum up Ron Paul's perspective when it comes to investing: gold, gold, and gold. Marketplace featured a story Thursday on Ron Paul's investment strategy of buying gold. Marketplace's Bob Moon interviewed Jason Zweig, an investing columnist from the Wall Street Journal. On the topic of Ron Paul's investment preferences, Zweig admitted, It's one of the most unusual portfolios I've ever seen. It's certainly the most unusual portfolio on Capitol Hill. According to Zweig, Paul is putting his money in gold, almost all of it. Zweig stated that Paul has pretty much made an all-in bet on the one thing that he does believe in. In this way, Zweig affirmed that Paul is putting his money where his mouth is. Those who follow Ron Paul may remember last July when Paul asked Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke whether gold is money. Whereas Bernanke replied that gold is not money, it would seem that Paul's investment choices reveal the Congressman's opinions on the matter. Commenting on Paul's portfolio, Zweig mentioned how he didn't think that Paul had lost any money in the last two or three years. Zweig: I have no doubt that [Paul's] portfolio has outperformed the stock market as a whole over the past few years. Zweig later suggested that Paul's investment strategy is due to the fact that Paul foresees inflation and a collapse of the US dollar. Even so, Zweig admitted, There are a lot of other bad things that could happen to the American economy, too, and this kind of portfolio won't protect against those. In terms of actual investment paths Zweig wrote that 21% of Rep. Paul's holdings are in real estate and roughly 14% in cash. Zweig: The remainder of Rep. Paul's portfolio -- fully 64% of his assets -- is entirely in gold and silver mining stocks. Back in August, my Benzinga colleague Scott Rubin discussed whether Ron Paul can be considered a master investor. Rubin cited an article from Barron's written by Jim McTague discussing how Paul's investment strategy is a financial planner's nightmare. McTague: Paul's portfolio amounts to a super bearish bet against the US economy. Even so, as bullish on gold as Paul appears, according to McTague, Paul's financial disclosures reveal no holdings of physical gold, gold coins, or gold equivalents like certain exchange-traded gold funds, which is confounding. McTague continued in that after a bit of research, a previous financial-disclosure form revealed Paul's holding semi-numismatic coins worth between $100,001 and $250,000. But from 2003 onward, they were never mentioned again. Thus, Paul's investment strategy seems to center more on miners and less on physical gold and/or ETFs. Ron Paul is not the only one who has been bullish on gold lately. Mad Money's Jim Cramer recently wrote a story for TheStreet.com on why investors should not give up on gold. Even further, Cramer discussed early in December on TheStreet.com how gold is the best trade for a possible recovery in Europe. While discussing the prospect of deflation with TheStreet.com's Alix Steel, Cramer stated that, People are saying, 'Jim, are you backing away from gold?' Gold's up 17 percent. I'm not backing away from gold. I've been consistently in favor of gold since the show began almost eight years ago. I'm not deviating. In terms of actual investments, Cramer said in November that investors should look at gold bullion and the SPDR Gold Shares ETF, which is probably the easiest way to go for the gold. Gold is currently trading at $1,609 per ounce, with a gain of over $200 in the past year. Obviously, in this type of volatile trading environment, information is key. Thus, it helps to know how big names are approaching the market. For more information on market chatter and market-moving rumors, remember to check out Benzinga's Real-Time Rumors. ACTION ITEMS: Bullish: Traders who believe that gold will rise despite fears of deflation might want to consider the following trades: Go long on SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: IAU). Also check out buying gold coins and bars. Bearish: Traders who believe that the price of gold will decline may consider alternate positions: Short the abovementioned ETFS or look into holding cash as an investment strategy.

2011-12-29,Banished: 2011's Biggest ETF Disappointments,"With just one full trading day left in 2011, everyone is making a list of about what worked and what did not in 2011 and what investment themes may or may not prove profitable in the year ahead. Hey, we've even done a few of our own lists. And with just one trading day left in the year, it's fair to say 2011 has been another good year for the exchange-trade products business. Even in a tough market environment, assets under management have grown and the number of new funds that have come to market in 2011 has been robust to say the least. Still, there have been small signs that everything isn't perfect when it comes to ETFs. In an industry that is growing this much this fast, there are bound to be disappointments and 2011 brought a few. For our list of this year's biggest ETF washouts, performance was not the sole determining factor of whether or not an ETF made the list. In fact, we're leaving some predictable suspects like the uranium ETFs off the list. Asset growth, volume and other factors were considered as we populated the list of 2011's Biggest ETF Disappointments. In no particular order... Market Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF (NYSE: REMX) REMX came to market late last year and today, the ETF has over $200 million in AUM and it's safe to say most investors know about this ETF. However, what they may know is that REMX has been an epic disappointment this year. The fundamental catalysts of restricted Chinese exports of rare earths and demand for rare earths in smartphones, tablets, cars, etc. was there for the most part, but REMX has tumbled 35% and things have gotten worse recently, not better. If this ETF falls below $14, watch out. WisdomTree India Earnings ETF (NYSE: EPI) My how the mighty have fallen. The WisdomTree India Earnings ETF was a 2011 angel that fell back to earth hard in 2011. With one trading day left in the year, EPI is down 40% year-to-date and like almost every other ETF, EPI's chart is market by lows highs and lower lows. Today the ETF is in major technical danger. No one could have forecast 2011 would be this bad for this fund. Direxion Daily Financial Bear Shares (NYSE: FAZ) Since we've already been critical of FAZ, we'll take it easy on the controversial ETF today. However, it should be noted that in a terrible year for bank stocks, FAZ is off almost 19%. iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) OK, so it probably wasn't reasonable to expect SLV to replicate 2010's stellar run, but 2011 has been a disaster. It's even worse when considering ETFs backed by physical gold are up about 10% on the year. And worse than all that is SLV has shown no signs of improvement in recent weeks. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) Really, any gold miners ETF would be fine to put in this spot, but will go with the biggest. GDX is down more than 15% year-to-date while the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) is up 10%. Enough said. Oh yeah, GDX recently violated critical support at $52 and unless the risk on trade comes back with a vengeance, this ETF and related fare could be in for more downside. IndexIQ Hong Kong Small Cap ETF (NYSE: HKK) We figured this ETF would struggle because 2011 has been unkind to emerging markets, but we also thought it would survive and eventually thrive. That is not the case as HKK was recently shuttered. ProShares UltraShort MSCI Europe (NYSE: EPV) Yes, we've picked on this one, too. However, this should have been the easiest trade of 2011: Short Europe. There's no such thing as a free lunch in the financial markets and leveraged ETFs such as EPV underscore that fact. iShares MSCI Sweden Index Fund (NYSE: EWD) Maybe we're being a bit harsh by including the iShares MSCI Sweden Index Fund on this list and we that because there's still good reason to believe in the Swedish economy, its AAA credit and low debt. However, Sweden as represented by EWD should have been a safe haven for investors in 2011. Quite the contrary. The ETF has slid more than 17%. On the bright side, EWD has started to perk up lately and the yield of over 4% is enticing here. PowerShares Financial Preferred ETF (NYSE: PGF) Maybe we're being a tad harsh again, but in a yield-starved environment, 2011 should have been a great year to be involved with preferred ETFs. PGF's biggest problem isn't that it tracks preferred stocks. It's the sector where all those preferred issues come from. The yield is almost 7.7%. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Financials Index Fund (Nasdaq: EMFN) Emerging markets. Bank stocks. Over 47% of an ETF's weight allocated to China, Brazil and India. It's easy to explain why EMFN has languished this year. For an iShares ETF, EMFN is small with just $3.1 million in AUM. The 7% yield is big and destined to get bigger. EMFN is too risky at the moment to play for a potential 2012 rebound."
2012-01-07,Are Diamonds Going to Outperform Gold This Year?,"One of the top headlines on the Drudge Report Friday night into Saturday morning linked to an interesting story from CBS Minnesota's Aristea Brady discussing how the price of diamonds is expected to significantly increase. From the article: Jewelers say you can expect to see price increases ranging from 10 percent to 20 percent depending on the quality of the diamond... Diamonds may be a girl's best friend, but new price hikes show they could become a man's worst nightmare. Why would the value of diamonds rise and outperform gold? According to the article, It all goes back to supply and demand, only this time, you have to take a global market into consideration. Diamond Direct owner John Sorich suggested that the fact that more individuals around the world are rising up to a middle-class level portends that demand for diamonds is increasing. Sorich: There seems to be more and more people reaching this middle-class level, that once they get there, they become consumers. According to India's Economic Times, the reason why diamond prices could outpace gold is because of increased spending on luxury goods in China, India, and the Middle East. Economic Times: The average price of rough, or uncut, diamonds will probably rise 9% to $145 a carat next year, 1.4% in 2013 and 4.8% in 2014. Even further, Prices of top-quality diamonds climbed 23% this year, the beggest gain since at least 2006, according to the Rapaport Diamond Trade Index. With an expanding middle class in China, India, and the Middle East, these regions in Asia will account for 40% of global diamond demand by 2015, compared with about 8% in 2005. Whereas the impetus of the expected rise in diamond prices seems to center around growing demand in Asia, traders may want to take a look at companies like Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF), Blue Nile, Inc. (NASDAQ: NILE), Signet Jewelers Ltd. (NYSE: SIG), and Zale Corporation (NYSE: ZLC). Even if global demand makes diamond prices rise significantly in the near future, one should be aware that diamonds are fundamentally not the same as gold. Thus, before you rush off to Blue Nile, JB Robinson's, or Jared Galleria of Jewelry to invest in diamonds, you may want to do some research on the history of the diamond trade. I have written previously, Unlike gold or silver, diamonds do not really have any intrinsic value per se. Though diamonds do have significant industrial purposes, a diamond engagement ring is pretty much a useless item. Going along with my previous article, one may wonder if the popularity of diamonds will continue if society matures and financial belts are tightened. Of course, for the foreseeable future, it would appear that diamonds will remain a popular global commodity. That being the case, as human civilization grows up and matures in the long-term, diamonds could become significantly less popular -- similar to how we do not trade parcels of land for tulip bulbs today. As DeBeers cornered the diamond market long ago, in some ways artificially manufactured demand (by virtue of an artificial monopoly) sustains the marketability of diamonds. As I explored previously, the 'tradition' of giving diamond rings for engagement was promulgated and aggressively marketed to Americans in the 1930s and 1940s. As such, arguably, diamonds do not share the same quality of inherent value as gold or silver. Supporters of Rep. Ron Paul may recall when the Congressman boldly questioned Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on if gold is money. Bernanke replied, No. [Gold] is a precious metal. In comparing gold to diamonds, Ron Paul continued, Why don't [central banks] hold diamonds? The reality is that though gold and diamonds may be put together for the sake of an engagement ring, diamonds are not like gold or silver. Diamonds have not historically functioned (in terms of price and value) the same as gold or silver. In some ways, investing in diamonds would be like investing in oil if Saudi Arabia owned every last oil well and every last drop of black gold coming out of the ground on the planet Earth and could on a whim manipulate the price of oil at will. As the popularity of diamonds is a product of a successful advertising ruse, to use an analogy to the inherent value of diamonds, it would be as if a lone trader traveled to a lost island on a barge with a lifetime supply of Coca-Cola. In order to deal with the natives on this lost island, the trader marketed empty Coke cans as valuable, magical items that a man must give his bride-to-be prior to marriage. Even in the context of the lost island, since the trader has a monopoly on a lifetime supply of Coca-Cola, the value of an empty Coke can (via marketing and trade) appears much greater to the natives than its inherent value -- which for most Americans, aside from recycling purposes, etc., an empty Coke can is merely useless trash. Thus, the trader is able to live like a king among the natives owing to his endless supply of worthless empty Coke cans. Natives on the island may even go so far as to steal, murder, and get into conflicts over these empty Coke cans. Whereas this exploitative scenario may be great for the trader, the same cannot be said for the natives -- whose lives, in dealing with a society consumed by this marketing ruse, are made that much more difficult, dangerous, painful, stressful, and frustrating. Given the artificiality and capriciousness of diamonds in terms of supply, demand, and profitable viability, not to mention bad publicity of diamonds courtesy of films like Blood Diamond, some traders may understandably be leery of the diamond industry. Even further, given the market reliability of gold and silver as opposed to De Beers' artificially monopolistic control of diamonds, some traders may be wary and skeptical of the thought of diamonds outperforming gold. And while manufactured demand may be demand nevertheless, the bottom line is that as much as diamonds outperform gold in the short-term, diamonds will never be gold.

2012-01-16,Au 1640: Is Gold Getting Lackluster?,"In light of the recent decline of the precious metal, is gold becoming a lackluster investment? MarketWatch's Claudia Assis had an article from Jan. 13, 2012 on why gold could lose its glitter in 2012. Assis: Investors who have recently jumped on the gold bandwagon will need plenty of patience this year, as the anemic global economy and better prospects for the US dollar combine to dim gold's allure. Whereas gold will probably rise in 2012 for the 12th year in a row, Assis commented that any advance is expected to be more modest than in recent years. According to Jay Feuerstein, chief investment officer of 2100 Xenon Group, a firm based out of Chicago that deals with commodity futures, short-term gold speculators are likely to have a tougher time with the metal this year. According to Assis' analysis of gold's prospects in 2012, the absence of catalysts to drive buyers to gold is affecting both demand and price. Owing to the fact that there have been no signs of further quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve anytime soon and as the Eurozone struggles with a serious debt crisis, gold appears to be linked to movement in the US dollar. Assis commented that the dollar is seen as firming this year as the US economy shows strength to other developed nations. That being the case, there is still room for gold in a balanced portfolio. Feuerstein noted that gold is a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations while recommending that investors limit gold to no more than 5 percent of one's portfolio. As for where gold will finish in 2012, Feuerstein sees gold ending 2012 not much beyond $1,700 an ounce. In comparison, Michael Widmer of Bank of America Merrill Lynch sees gold approaching $2,000 by year-end. Gold is currently trading at $1,640 per ounce. Assis noted that gold may be an advantageous way to offset currency risk, to guard against global economic uncertainty, or to protect against a black swan type event (we are living in the year 2012 after all) that would throw the global economy into tumult. Assis concluded her analysis in that gold miners have underperformed in comparison to gold. Even so, investors might want to give the miners another chance owing to the possibility of dividends, growth prospects, and better management in various mining companies. In pertinent part, Assis mentioned Newmont Mining Corp. (NYSE: NEM), Eldorado Gold Corp. (NYSE: EGO), Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (NYSE: AEM), and Osisko Mining Corp. (TSE:OSK) as being possible investment opportunities. In terms of investing in gold via mining companies, readers may remember my recent discussion on Republican presidential candidate Rep. Ron Paul's investment strategy. Far from what a financial planner may consider a balanced portfolio, 64 percent of Paul's assets are in gold and silver mining stocks with no disclosed holdings of physical gold, gold coins, or gold ETFs. On the topic of gold's place in a balanced portfolio, Mad Money's Jim Cramer has gone so far as to place gold as one of the five key areas for his new diversification method of investing. Reporting on Cramer's perspective on diversification, CNBC's Drew Sandholm wrote in August 2011, For maximum protection and maximum upside, investors need to be in these five areas: gold, a dividend-paying stock with a high-yield, a growth stock, a speculative play and something foreign. For Cramer, gold can be likened to an insurance policy against economic or geopolitical chaos, uncertainty and inflation. As for whether traders and investors should buy gold mining stocks, physical gold, or ETFs, Cramer has said that buying bullion only makes sense of investors, who can afford to buy in bulk and pay for the bricks to be stored in a depository bank. As for gold miners, Cramer has previously recommended Agnico-Eagle (NYSE: AEM) and Eldorado Gold Corp. (NYSE: EGO). Cramer: To make sure your portfolio works in any kind of market, you need to own some gold as insurance. Even recently, Cramer has written for TheStreet.com that investors should not give up on gold. Far from Feuerstein's recommended limit of 5 percent, during the Mad Mail segment on the Jan. 13, 2012 episode of Mad Money, when asked how much gold one should keep in his portfolio, Cramer responded that a good benchmark would be between 10 and 20 percent. Cramer: I don't regard gold as a stock. I regard it as a currency. It's an alternative currency to the fiat currency, the printed currency, that we have in the United States and they have in Europe. Cramer added, I trust gold; I don't trust paper. While gold may be losing its glitter, what about other precious metals? Platinum is currently trading at $1,493 per ounce. Ah yes, I can remember the good ol' days when platinum was more expensive than gold. While platinum went as high as $2,200 per ounce in early 2008, it would appear that the metal bubbled out in late 2008 falling to near $800 per ounce while scraping back to near $1,000 per ounce in early 2009. While we are on the topic of precious metals, we cannot forget about silver. Silver is currently trading near $30 per ounce. It's hard to believe that silver was at around $5 per ounce in 2000. Heck, in 2008 the metal fell from $20 per ounce to $10 per ounce. While gold historically has been the prime precious metal of the international market, investors cannot forget about silver. It could just be me, but where gold may be perceived as more valuable than silver, silver (at least to me) seems to be the much more practical precious metal for everyday traders and investors. The idea of a mere handful of coins being worth $5,000 to $10,000 can be quite daunting. This is not to say, Leave all the gold to the banks and kings, but in terms of practical value given practical storage, there is something to be said for silver's utility and relative ease for transactions. To illustrate the differentiation of gold and silver in terms of practical use, historically gold was used for expensive purchases, expensive trading, and bulk transactions, i.e. financial transactions of the wealthy. Everyday transactions for common people were in copper and silver coins. This is part of the reason why the UK's currency is known as the pound sterling and not the pound gold. Even further, the historical gold to silver ratio was 12 to 1, that is to say, 12 one-ounce coins of silver would be equal to one one-ounce gold coin. Were this historical ratio instituted today, from gold's price an ounce of silver would be worth roughly $136.83 today; from silver's price one ounce of gold would be worth roughly $360 per ounce. In light of this historical perspective, it would appear that silver has substantial room to rally in the years to come. Thus, even if gold is losing its luster in the short-term, silver may inherit some of that lost glitter. And given the possibility of political uncertainty and geopolitical tumult, in terms of everyday utility, silver may become the more practical investment for the everyday investor. Indeed, all that glitters is not gold. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that gold will retain its glitter in 2012 might want to consider the following trades: Go long on SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: IAU).Traders could also check out purchasing physical gold in bars and coins. Traders looking to take advantage of growth from gold via mining stocks can check out Newmont Mining Corp. (NYSE: NEM), Eldorado Gold Corp. (NYSE: EGO), Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. (NYSE: AEM), and Osisko Mining Corp. (TSE:OSK) Bearish:Traders who believe that gold is losing its glitter and still want to invest in precious metals may consider alternate positions:Short the above, and check out iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSE: SLV) and physical silver in coins and bars.Traders could also check out ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT) and ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL).

2012-02-08,ETFs For QE3: More Than Just GLD,"Comments by San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams today serve as a reminder that another round of quantitative easing remains at the Fed's disposal should the U.S. economy start to falter. Williams appears to be a fan of buying mortgage-backed securities, but how many fans will QE3 have? Arguably, QE3 is about as good of an idea as Godfather III, maybe worse. Fixed income experts have argued more asset purchases by the Fed could spell the end of the bull market for bonds. In 2010, Pimco's Bill Gross said Check writing [QE2] in the trillions is not a bondholder's friend; it is in fact inflationary, and, if truth be told, somewhat of a Ponzi scheme. Simply put, another round of QE is likely to be viewed as controversial and that's probably putting things mildly. Of course, another QE package will be good news for select ETFs and that means more than just gold funds such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). If QE3 does arrive, the following ETFs could very well thrive. Market Vectors Mortgage REIT Income ETF (NYSE: MORT) In theory, the Market Vector Mortgage REIT Income ETF should at least have potential assuming the Fed ups its purchases of mortgage-backed securities. However, a very real problem for MORT exists in the form of some of its constituents' dividends being viewed as vulnerable. American Capital (Nasdaq: AGNC) announced a divided cut earlier this week, but some analysts have defended the stock. That stock represents almost 14.6% of MORT's weight and Annaly Capital (NYSE: NLY) accounts for another 20%. If Fed action helps stocks like Annaly and American Capital, then MORT benefits. It's that simple. ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) As we noted earlier, there are more winners under a QE3 scenario than just gold and some can be find with gold's cheaper but still precious alternatives. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns, but QE2 was announced in late August 2010. Around that time PALL was in the $52-$53 range. The ETF finished 2010 flirting with $75 and much of that gain can be attributed to QE2. FactorShares 2X: S&P500 Bull/USD Bear (NYSE: FSU) Just a couple weeks shy of its first birthday, the FactorShares 2X: S&P500 Bull/USD Bear is one of the most unique leveraged ETFs out there. It's best to let the issuer tell you what the fund does. FSU seeks to track approximately +200% of the daily return of the S&P 500 Non-U.S. Dollar Index (before fees and expenses) by primarily establishing a leveraged long position in the E-mini S&P 500 Stock Price Index Futures and a leveraged short position in the U.S. Dollar Index Futures, according to the FactorShares Web site. Translation: FSU offers a straight forward approach to more QE: Long stocks, short the greenback. Just don't make a habit of this leveraged fund as it has an expense ratio of 0.75%. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) Since QE has a way of stoking risk appetite, an equities-based materials play makes sense as an addition to this list. With XLB, we're applying the same logic as we did with PALL. In August 2010, XLB was trading in the $32-$33 area. By the end of the year, the ETF was over $38. Even with no QE3, XLB might be worth a look here. The ETF is up over 12% year-to-date and recently cleared some stiff resistance. The ETF could have upside to the $40-$42 area."
2012-02-21,Gold Rush,"This morning, the precious metals are trading sharply higher. The catalyst for the advance in gold, and silver is the weaker U.S. Dollar Index, and the pledge by central banks to keep easy money available. Last night, the People Bank of China (Chinese central bank) cut reserve requirements for lenders. This is just another example of easy credit. All of these similar actions by the central banks around the world are inflationary and that is exactly what gold and most other precious metals are saying to us today. This morning, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) is trading higher by $3.25 to $170.60 a share. Other precious metal ETF's that are trading higher today include ProShares Ultra Silver ETF (NYSE: AGQ), Central Fund of Canada Limited (NYSE: CEF), and the iShares Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: IAU). Traders and investors should continue to follow the U.S. Dollar Index as a weaker dollar will usually inflate these equities higher. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"

2012-02-27,"Developed Markets: A Commodities Vs. Country Fund Comparison (EWA, EWL, BNO)","Last week, we looked at the performance of several country-specific emerging markets ETFs relative to a commodity or commodities that the countries are often most associated with. The results were interesting in that we found the country ETFs have been outperforming the commodities or related commodities funds they were compared to. At least that has been the case this year. It's also important to remember that there are plenty of developed markets with deep ties to the commodities trade. With that, we're now going to compare the performance of several developed market country-specific ETFs against the commodities those countries are often associated with. Global X FTSE Norway 30 ETF (NYSE: NORW) The Global X FTSE Norway 30 ETF made our list of ways to play rising Brent crude prices and nothing has materialized to make us change that view. Statoil (NYSE: STO), Norway's largest oil company, is NORW's largest individual holding at almost 24.4%. Overall, the energy sector represents almost 44% of NORW's weight. Since Norwegian oil is subject to Brent pricing, it's relevant to compare the performance of NORW to the U.S. Brent Oil Fund (NYSE: BNO). Year-to-date, NORW has outpaced BNO, but by a small margin. That said, NORW is still a solid developed market play on rising oil prices. IndexIQ Canada Small Cap ETF (NYSE: CNDA) We've previously noted that the iShares MSCI Canada Index Fund (NYSE: EWC), by far the largest Canada ETF, is somewhat light on energy and materials exposure. However, those sectors combine for 73% of the IndexIQ Canada Small Cap ETF's weight. Year-to-date, CNDA has lagged BNO, but has also easily outdistanced the U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO). Canada is also a major silver producer and every Canada-specific ETF has lagged the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) this year. iShares MSCI Australia Index Fund (NYSE: EWA) Using the iShares MSCI Australia Index Fund (NYSE: EWA) as a proxy for the precious metals trade has been done before and with the ETF solidly in the green in 2012, it hasn't been a bad idea this year, either. However, EWA has really been taken to school by SLV and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Things get a little better with the IndexIQ Australia Small Cap ETF (NYSE: KROO), which has been better than IAU and EWA, but not nearly as good as SLV. iShares MSCI New Zealand Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: ENZL) New Zealand is often viewed as a commodities play, though the country isn't really known for one commodity in particular and investors have a tendency to overlook the fact it's agriculture exports that are a big driver of this economy. Along those lines, ENZL has been a far better bet than the PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF (NYSE: DBA) in 2012, but the Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO) has been far superior to both DBA and ENZL. iShares MSCI Switzerland Index Fund (NYSE: EWL) Switzerland's primary exports are watches and chocolates, along with chemicals and machinery. For those want to some tasty chocolate exposure this year, the iPath DJ-UBS Cocoa TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: NIB) has outpaced EWL), but the reality is Switzerland is viewed more as a play on gold even though the country doesn't mine the yellow metal, at least not on any meaningful scale. In this case, IAU would be a better way of playing gold rather than trying to backdoor your way into gold with EWL, an ETF that is arguably too heavy on bank stocks."
2012-02-29,"Dented Armor: It Might Be Time For These Inverse ETFs (DZZ, TZA, INDZ)","Memo to ESPN: Now that's how you make a reference with armor in it without offending an entire ethnic group. Fun at Mickey Mouse's expense aside, it's hard to not get the feeling today that this rally may be a little tired. We're not saying a new bear market is upon us, but there are some clues a pullback may be afoot. For example, the iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (NYSE: IWM) is down almost 1% today, more than quadruple the loss for the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). Gold and silver are getting destroyed. Those are just a couple of examples. What's clear is that it may be time to consider some risk. Risk with leveraged and inverse ETFs that is. Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TZA) Remember what we just said about IWM and SPY? That's why TZA merits consideration right now. This is thing about TZA: It is not for the faint of heart and if one cannot have strong conviction about being involved with this ETF, then one best stay away because in the 10 seconds it takes to type 10 words, TZA could move 10, 20 cents or more. You've been warned. Direxion Daily India Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: INDZ) The Direxion Daily India Bear 3X Shares is another case of a risky leveraged ETF that might be worth a look because of signals being flashed from the land of small-caps. In this case we're talking about ETFs like the Market Vectors India Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: SCIF), which have been on fire to start 2012, but have also weakened some in recent days. This isn't a proclamation that India ETFs are going to go in the tank for the rest of the year, but nothing moves up in a straight line and plenty of India funds are overbought. INDZ is a stealth hedge on long India positions. ProShares UltraShort QQQ (NYSE: QID) Unfortunately for the Nasdaq, Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) does not yet account for 100% of the index. That means there's still a chance Apple can go up, but the index can go down. Or to make matters worse, Apple can pullback, meaning the chances of the Nasdaq going up are slim and none. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ is great tool for hedging a long position in Apple or an ETF that's heavy on the stock. PowerShares DB Crude Oil Double Short ETN (NYSE: DTO) It's not so much a matter of being long-term bearish on crude as it is looking at the chart of the United States Brent Oil Fund (NYSE: BNO) and discovering oil is overbought here and BNO is primed for a decline in the near-term. It may not be deep or last more than a few days and be advised that DTO is more tied to WTI than Brent, but a pullback is a pullback and that means DTO has some value here. PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) Obviously, Wednesday is one of those days where one wishes he could go back to Tuesday to back up the bus on the PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN because DZZ is up over 11% in late trading. Usually, a leveraged ETF or ETN with a price tag as low as DZZ's will be subject to a reverse split, but we haven't heard anything to that effect regarding DZZ. In other words, traders can hedge long positions in ETFs like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) for less than $5 with DZZ."

2012-03-29,"The Mega Millions ETF Portfolio (XOP, VTV, IAU)","Those not living in a cave have by now heard the the Mega Millions jackpot for Friday's drawing has reached an estimated $500 million. That's the largest prize in the game's history. Exciting stuff to be sure, but the reality is one stands a better chance of being struck by lightening. The odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are an unfavorable one in 176 million. Working on the assumption that someone reading this article has the good fortune to win the jackpot, that lucky soul will have the option of taking a $359 million cash payout. That's still a tidy sum. A lot of investing and trading can be done with $360 million and that sum would certainly be good enough to gain entry into more than a few hedge funds. For those that want to manage that lofty sum on their own, the following ETFs are worth a look. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR is of course low-beta and almost downright boring in the world of sector ETFs, but just because one has $360 million to play with doesn't mean that they should be taking on excessive risk. At least one of your new ETF positions should be something for the long-term and something that won't cause lost sleep at night. A stake in XLP would make your grandad and Warren Buffett proud. Rounding up a bit, 1 million shares of XLP would run about $34 million, leaving the Mega Millions winner with $325 million, some of which can be devoted to the... WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund (NYSE: DEM) Of course some of the winnings should go to an emerging markets fund, but we can do better than standard fare such s the Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: VWO). There's a lot to like with DEM, including a yield approaching 4% and that the fund is up 12% year-to-date, just be advised Brazil and Taiwan account for over 43% of the fund's country allocation. Let's say that DEM finds its way down to $56, and it looks like it will, 1 million shares costs $56 million and that leaves $269 million, some of which can be invested in the... Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) With $269 million left at this point, one could still afford plenty of shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) directly, but if that's not your cup of tea, XLK will work. As has been documented countless times this year, Apple is XLK's largest holding. As of Wednesday, it accounted for 19.17% of the fund's weight. Dow components International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) and Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) combine for another 16%. The tech sector has been leading the market higher this year and with Apple being a runaway train let's allocate 2 million shares to XLK, which costs $60 million. That leaves $209 million for other funds such as the... Vanguard Value ETF (NYSE: VTV) We considered the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSE: VIG) for this spot, but VTV has a much lower allocation to staples stocks and is cheaper than VIG. This is another conservative, sleep at night ETF and the meager 0.12% expense ratio means you won't be getting decked just for the privilege of stashing some of your mega millions winnings here. Financials and health care combine for over 36% of VTV's weight. One million shares will cost about $57 million, leaving $152 million for ETFs such as the... iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) Yes, gold has lost some of its luster over the past month, but if we get more quantitative easing investors won't want to be caught without some gold exposure. Some experts would argue investors should have 5%-10% of their portfolios in precious metals. Buying 2 million shares of IAU for about $32 million of your $369 million Mega Millions winnings covers a proper gold allocation and leaves you with $120 million. EGShares Emerging Markets Consumer ETF (NYSE: ECON) Given the size of the jackpot and the mostly conservative nature of the portfolio to this point, one can afford to take some risks. The EGShares Emerging Markets Consumer ETF isn't overly risky because it does feature a decent weight to staples names and as the emerging markets consumer is validated as an investment theme this ETF will benefit. One million shares should cost $24 million in a day or two. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP) At the moment, it's hard to get excited about oil and gas stocks because they're leading the market lower, but our Mega Millions portfolio is lacking for energy exposure and XOP will certainly add some beta without excessive weights to the likes of Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX). Wait for XOP to fall to its 200-day line at $55 and see if holds support there. Then throw in for a million shares, costing $55 million. That means $41 million is left over and advisable destinations for that money would include yield plays such as the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE: LQD) or the Vanguard REIT Index ETF (NYSE: VNQ)."

2012-04-13,"3 ETFs For Akshaya Tritiya (GLD, INCO, INXX)","Most Americans probably don't know that the one of the most important celebrations for the Hindu faith and in Indian culture rolls around later this month, that being Akshaya Tritiya. Akshaya means eternal or that which never diminishes and it is widely believed that new ventures that are started on Akshaya Tritiya bring good fortune. Akshaya Tritiya also coincides with Indian wedding season being in full bloom and those two factors combined lend efficacy to once again examining Indian investment opportunities. On a year-to-date basis, India-specific ETFs particularly the small-cap funds are sporting some tidy gains, but the past month has been a different story. The Market Vectors India Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: SCIF) was the second-best performing U.S.-listed in the first quarter, but that fund is down 7.4% in the past month and is off almost 3% today. The WisdomTree India Earnings ETF (NYSE: EPI) has shed 7% in the past month and is being slammed to the tune of 3.5% on Friday. Maybe Akshaya Tritiya is just the relief ETFs with deep ties to India need to get back in the swing of things. Consider the following. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) A big part of the reason that ETFs backed by physical gold have struggled in recent weeks is because the Indian government said last month it would double taxes on imported gold and tax most gold jewelry. That led to a three-week strike by Indian jewelers and fears of these tax proposals sent chills down the backs of gold bugs because India is the world's largest gold consumer. The strike has ended as Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee has said he will consider scuttling the new tax proposals. GLD and the rival iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) are worth a look now because Indian wedding season and Akshaya Tritiya typically result in increased demand for the yellow metal in India. After all, it's believed that gold purchased and worn on Akshaya Tritiya brings good luck. EGShares India Consumer ETF (NYSE: INCO) INCO continues to be an unheralded, almost ignored ETF as no shares have changed hands in the fund yet today. That means a lot of traders and investors are ignoring one of the best ETFs for the emerging market consumer investment theme. About 36% of INCO's weight goes to personal products makers and that's a decent play on Akshaya Tritiya and Indian wedding season right there, but the ETF also features a combined allocation of almost 27% to food, beverage, tobacco, travel and leisure goods companies, validating INCO as the preeminent play on the Indian consumer. EGShares India Infrastructure ETF (NYSE: INXX) The EGShares India Infrastructure ETF is one of the prime examples of an India-specific ETF that started 2012 on fire, but has cooled considerably, falling 7.4% in the past month. After being turned back by resistance at $17, INXX has proceeded to violate support at $15, highlighting some near-term technical issues. All of that said, INXX could be worth a look, and we're not kidding, because Akshaya Tritiya is believed to be the ideal time to commence new business and infrastructure ventures because of the good fortune associated with the celebration.

2012-04-13,J.P. Morgan Files For Copper ETF...Again,"J.P. Morgan Commodity ETF Services, the ETF arm of Dow component J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), has reportedly filed plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission to list the JPM XF Physical Copper Trust, an exchange-traded product backed by physical copper holdings. The filing is dated April 2 and could result in 60,000 tons of the red metal being purchased for the fund. The JPM XF Physical Copper Trust could list as soon as early June and could provide a boost to downtrodden copper prices. The iPath DJ-UBS Copper TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: JJC) slid 2.6% on Friday following China's disappointing first-quarter GDP growth of 8.1%. China is the world's largest copper consumer. The J.P. Morgan filing for a copper ETF isn't exactly new news. In 2010, the bank along with Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB), BlackRock's (NYSE: BLK) iShares, the world's largest ETF issuer, and ETF Securities filed plans for copper-backed ETFs. In December 2010 following news of those filings, RBS said a copper-backd ETF could boost prices to $4.50 a pound and one analyst quoted in a Financial Times piece said a successful copper ETF could be the difference between copper priced at $8,500 per ton and $10,000 per ton. LME benchmark copper closed below $8,000 per ton on Friday. While expense ratios for physically-backed funds such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYES: GLD), iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) and iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) are reasonable, that might not be the case with a copper ETF. As Benzinga reported over a year ago a consideration for ETF issuers looking to enter the physical copper game is the cost of storage, which could lead to higher expense ratios for investors. J.P. Morgan's filing said the bank will use its warehouse company Henry Bath Group to store the metal in both on- and off-warrant facilities initially in the Netherlands, Singapore, South Korea, Shanghai, China and the United States, Reuters reported."
2012-04-16,"Is Gold's Party Over? (GLD, IAU)","Since 2000, gold bugs have had been laughing at the yellow metal's naysayers. Legendary investors including Warren Buffett and George Soros have taken turns criticizing gold, whether it be to say the precious metal is a bubble waiting to pop or to note gold really has no utility. Even with an ample chorus of boo-birds weighing in, gold's ascent since 2000 when it traded around $300 an ounce has been nothing short of staggering. While gold is getting hammered today, the spot price is still around $1,650 an ounce as of this writing, meaning the yellow metal has surged more than fivefold since 2000. Since its debut in late 2004, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) has surged almost 260%, garnering $68.8 billion in assets under management along the way. That makes GLD the world's second-largest ETF behind the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). The iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) is no shrinking violet, either. That fund has gained nearly 277% since its 2005 debut and has raked in almost $9.7 billion in AUM along the way. All nice superlatives, but with the way gold has been acting lately, it begs the question: Is the party over? The answer might be Not quite yet, but there are reasons for concern. Last week, metals consultancy GFMS said gold could top out at $2,000 an ounce next, marking an end to the yellow metal's bull market. GFMS also noted supply and demand dynamics that would favor gold bears this year, saying there could be a gold surplus of $130 billion, Reuters reported. Perhaps more concerning is the fact that gold has shown little signs of being a safe have this year. Year-to-date, GLD is up about 5.3% as gold prices have NOT been bolstered by Europe's worsening sovereign debt crisis or the continued running of hot printing presses by global central banks. Italy, a major gold consumer, is officially in a recession and home to soaring sovereign bond yields. And then there's India. The world's largest gold consumer put a lid on gold prices by proposing new taxes on gold imports and jewelry. Those proposals may be revoked, but the damage is done. Add to that, demand in China, the world's second-largest gold consumer, has been seen as tepid this year. Simply put, gold's lack of industrial use should have at least kept the metal's safe haven status in tact this year, insulating investors from the whims of a volatile global economy. That hasn't been the case. Even with those problems, gold has been trading at a premium to platinum for a while now and on a historical basis, that's not a good thing. Then there is the case of gold's ugly technicals. Looking at a weekly chart of gold's run over the past three years, the yellow metal has done an amazing job of honoring its 200-day moving average, but it violated the key indicator late last year and did it again recently, indicating the path of least resistance may be lower and that a party that started in 2000 may be over.

2012-04-18,Bold ETF Call Of The Day: Embracing Gold Miners,"It's no secret that ETFs tracking gold miners have significantly lagged their physically-backed counterparts. That much is proven by this statistic: In the past year, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the largest physically-backed gold ETF in the world, is up 9.2% while the Market Vectors Gold ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is off 23.4%. The miners vs. gold price conundrum has confounded both analysts and investors, making any bullish call on the disappointing miners bold to say the least. On the other hand, some might argue that the miners offer superior risk/reward compared to gold-backed ETFs going forward. That's the position of Street One Financial President Scott Freeze who discussed the potential virtues of the gold miners with Benzinga today. If you look at miners on a historical basis, they go through periods of lagging gold futures and then a period of substantial outperformance, Freeze said. We've seen capitulation with the miners, we've already been there. Since the miners have already been lagging, they offer more upside than downside now compared to a fund like GLD. Regarding gold mining ETFs, Freeze has a preference for the unheralded Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG). The Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF debuted 13 months ago, but has just $4.6 million in assets under management compared to over $8 billion for GDX. Freeze noted that GGGG's 26 equity holdings are all pure play gold miners, but GDX holds several silver miners including Silver Wheaton (NYSE: SLW) and Pan American Silver (Nasdaq: PAAS). GGGG's largest holding is El Dorado Gold (NYSE: EGO). Noting that an inflationary environment could hit investors sometime over the next 15 months because of previous rounds of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, Free said gold is poised to outperform the other precious metals. Gold itself will outperform other metals and GGGG should outperform GDX though GDX should do better than GLD, according to Freeze. Gold prices have slid recently, sending GLD down 1.18% in the past month while the rival iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) is off 1.24% over the same time, but that may not have the impact on the bottom lines of miners because many effectively hedged their production by selling gold futures contracts to lock in higher prices late last year and early this year. The gold miners are already hedged by having sold gold futures contracts. They're still locked in at a higher future price, Freeze said. We've heard about some foreign companies that have done that and it bodes well for upside in the miners. Regarding silver, Freeze said Europe's sovereign debt crisis could hamper silver production and he ranks silver third in terms of preference of the four precious metals behind gold and palladium. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), the largest ETF backed by physical silver, has slid 3.25% in the past month. The ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) and the ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT) are both down more than 5.5% over the same time. Regarding the gold miners, Freeze said investors need to assess the risk/reward scenario. Investors should be looking at pure risk/reward, he said. GLD is more expensive while GGGG has been lagging, but its underlying components should beat expectations. There's more upside and less downside with the miners compared to the physical gold ETFs.

2012-04-25,3 ETFs For The FOMC Minutes...If You Must,"The Federal Open Market Committee concluded its two-day meeting, releasing minutes that held precious little in the way of surprises. Interest rates will remain at 0.25%, the Fed anticipates keeping rates low through late 2014 and Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker was again the lone FOMC member to dissent, once again expressing his view that rates will need to rise before 2014. From the FOMC statement: Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately. Labor market conditions have improved in recent months; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment have continued to advance. Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline. However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable. Maybe there are some ETF trades in there after all, starting with... PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) Leading up to the conclusion of the FOMC meeting, there was plenty of chatter that, at the very least, gold bugs needed the Fed to reiterate that rates would remain low through late 2014. The Fed did that, but the reality was, gold bugs needed more than that because the yellow metal has been a risk asset this year, not a safe haven. In fact, losses in the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) accelerated after the FOMC minutes were released. For now, gold may need QE3 and it definitely needs a resolution to the European sovereign debt crisis. And that leads us to the... ProShares UltraShort Silver (NYSE: ZSL) If you want to see an ugly chart that is bound to get uglier real quick, check out the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV). Silver had a few days in the sun earlier this year when the risk on trade was on and investors liked what they were hearing on the economic data front. Those positive catalysts are out the window, and anyone thinks SLV looks like a steal because it's flirting with $29, should be careful. The $24-$25 area is a legitimate possibly in the near-term. Market Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSE: OIH) Unlike gold and silver, oil really doesn't need another round of quantitative easing to move higher. Sure, it would help, but QE3 or a lack thereof will not be the sole determinant of oil's price action over the next few months. Remember this line from the FOMC statement: Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline. Save for National Oilwell Varco (NYSE: NOV) today, OIH's other big constituents, namely Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) and Halliburton (NYSE: HAL), have not disappointed on the earnings front and that has helped OIH's chart firm a bit. Oil services stocks are intimately correlated oil futures and if there was one sector fund to nibble at now ahead of the inevitable inflation caused by the Fed's easy money policy, OIH might just be the one.

Keep an eye on the Global X Social Media Index ETF (Nasdaq: SOCL). Put the ProShares UltraShort Silver (NYSE: ZSL) on your radar. The SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP) is worth a look.

2012-05-04,"4 Inverse ETFs For Sell In May (BZQ, DZZ, FXP)","May 4 is turning out to be one of those days that are good for one thing: Helping traders and investors come to grips with reality and the realities in this case are two-fold. First, it's unfortunately obvious that caution, not ebullience is the order of the day when it comes to U.S. economic data. Second, the phenomenon known as Sell in May and go away could be a real problem this, if Friday's action is any indication. Selling in May isn't the worst thing in the world for those that are properly prepared and ETFs certainly offer myriad avenues for that preparation. We've previously highlighted multiple funds, including some inverse plays that have the look of worthy sell in May plays. Today, we're building on that theme with a list comprised of entirely of inverse and leveraged ETFs that could prove to be highly profitable short-term trades if the market has to endure an acute case of the summertime doldrums. ProShares UltraShort MSCI Brazil (NYSE: BZQ) Remember the time when ETFs such as the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ) and the Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: BRF) were sporting year-to-date gains of almost 20%? Yeah, it's hard to remember, but it was sometime in February. These days, EWZ is clinging to positive territory on a year-to-date basis. The charts for EWZ, BRF and other long Brazil funds are simply broken at the moment. On the other hand, BZQ is up more than 6% in the past two days alone. A move above $17.50 and BZQ will samba even more to the upside. Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST) DUST doesn't get a lot of press, which is odd considering its volume is better than fair at almost 238,000 shares per day. Even more odd is the fact that everyone and his sister knows that gold mining ETFs such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) have stunk up the joint this year and the charts for these funds indicate more downside is on the way. Up 29% year-to-date, DUST is arguably one of the best leveraged ETFs no one has talked about. PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) The ProShares UltraShort Silver (NYSE: ZSL) made our previous list of sell in May and go away candidates and even though ETFs such as the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) are higher today, the technical outlook is still murky at best for gold futures. If gold fails to break resistance at $1,670 an ounce or fails to hold support at $1,630, DZZ immediately becomes an attractive short-term play. ProShares UltraShort FTSE China 25 (NYSE: FXP) The iShares MSCI China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) has an interesting track record in May-October time frame over the past several years. The largest China ETF was badly beaten in that period in 2008, but was a stellar performer a year later. FXI inched higher in May-October 2010 and was again taken to the woodshed last year. Where we're going with this is FXI doesn't look like a bowl of cherries right now and Chinese stocks have clearly been hurt by sell in May and go away in the past. If FXI breaks $36, FXP becomes all the more attractive. Or swing for the fences with the Direxion Daily China Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: YANG). For more on inverse ETFs, please click HERE."

2012-06-07,"4 ETFs For Bernanke's QE3 Tease, er, Congressional Testimony (XHB, VWO, GLD)","Those not living under a rock know that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testifies before the Joint Economic Committee today. Following Wednesday's stock market rally, which was due in large part to speculation that the Fed may engage in further asset-buying programs, Bernanke now holds the cards when it comes to determining the near-term fate of riskier assets. Other Fed members have dropped some hints about more quantitative easing and for his part, Bernanke hasn't completely ruled it out. On the other hand, he hasn't overtly endorsed the idea of QE3, either. With Operation Twist ending at the end of this month and the U.S. economic recovery still fragile, traders will be held hostage by Bernanke's comments today and any verbiage that is construed as a blow to QE3 hopes could easily send markets tumbling. With long-term interest rates at record lows, betting on the prospect of more quantitative easing doesn't seem like a winning prospect, but traders can find ETF winners and losers for the Bernanke testimony right here. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) Or the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Both GLD and IAU are obvious, yet important plays on Uncle Ben's comments. Spot gold was trading around $1,620 an ounce in Asian trading following a modest gain for COMEX gold on Wednesday. This is the reality for gold bugs: Bernanke probably isn't the biggest gold fan out there, but his policies to this point have fanned the flames of gold's rally over the past several years. Does gold absolutely need more easing to move higher? No. Would gold get a lift from more easing? Yes. The yellow metal's move away from risk status could be tested tomorrow and the response will be telling about how gold will behave over the next few months. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE: XHB) It's likely that Bernanke will chime in on the health of the U.S. housing market and those comments could reduce or increase XHB's vulnerability. Prior to the start of May, XHB had been one of the better performing sectors ETFs in 2012, but this fund's constituency is just too sensitive to economic data to make this ETF durable in the current environment of bleak data points. Bottom line for traders: Bernanke will chart XHB's course on Thursday and for several days beyond. Market Vectors High-Yield Muni ETF (NYSE: HYD) Let's wax hypothetical for the moment and say that Bernanke does overtly say more QE is on the way. That would be a killer for Treasuries and probably chase investors out of scores of bond funds, but municipal bonds could prove resilient even in the face of more easing. Munis have proven sturdy in the face of headwinds specific to the asset class, so it's not likely Bernanke's whims will impact HYD beyond the next few days. Beyond that, if more QE is on the way, some investors will still want some bond exposure and HYD has the right combination of robust yield and low default risk to remain a solid performer. Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: VWO) Emerging markets ETFs have a tendency to react to Bernanke's comments, particularly when the Fed chairman endorses an accommodating monetary policy. Down 8.1% in the past month, VWO and its rivals need all the help they can get and it doesn't matter where it comes from. The rub here is that Bernanke is the chairman of the U.S. central bank and his counterparts in the countries represented in VWO can do enough on their own to hamper this ETF. Other emerging markets plays that Bernanke could bolster: iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ), iShares South Korea Index Fund (NYSE: EWY) and the Global X FTSE Colombia 20 ETF (NYSE: GXG)."
2012-06-15,Ride The Wave Or Fade It? ETFs For Greek Election Results,"Greece will hold elections Sunday. Many market observers believe the battle between radical leftist Alexis Tsipras and New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras could decide the country's future relationship with the Eurozone. Widely viewed as the first country to potentially depart the 17-nation common currency scheme, Greece and its fiscal woes have been roiling global markets for nearly two years. Tsipras opposes the terms of bailout plans, but has said he wants his country to remain in the Eurozone. His opponent Samaras, who supports the bailout, has said he would like to renegotiate terms of a loan deal in an effort to inflict less pain on the Greek populace. No matter the outcome, a Greek departure from the common currency and subsequent return to the drachma would have dire consequences. Greek banks are already seeing up to $1 billion per day in withdrawals, and could be crushed by a drachma return. Citigroup (NYSE: C) said last month that the new drachma would immediately lose 60% of its value. To say this election is important is an understatement. Traders can prepare for the outcomes with the following ETFs: Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF (NYSE: GREK) An obvious play, but it is worth noting that thinly traded GREK saw its volume explode on Thursday. Speculation was rampant that global central banks were preparing plans to inject liquidity into the international financial system following the Greek elections. That rumor sent GREK up 12.5% on better than quadruple the fund's average daily volume. Financials account for a third of GREK's allocation, which amplifies the impact Sunday's election could have on this ETF. GREK has gained almost 19% in the past five trading days and that rapid gain could underscore the ETF's vulnerability on the downside. On Thursday, it took less than 64,000 shares to move this ETF up almost 13%. In other words, it wouldn't take many sell orders to send GREK to a double-digit loss after the election. Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE: VGK) The Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF is not heavy on Greek equities, but it is one of the premier Europe ETFs. Despite the fact that VGK is home to plenty of blue-chip names, the Europe label has plagued this fund, which has lost almost 22% in the past year. VGK recently found support near $38, but the fund faces what could prove to be stiff overhead resistance around $42. If things do not go well in Greece on Sunday, resistance will not be a problem for VGK. Those looking to hedge a long-term position in VGK or make an outright bet against the fund should consider the ProShares UltraShort MSCI Europe (NYSE: EPV). Guggenheim Shipping ETF (NYSE: SEA) In 2011, Greece's economy was the 34th-largest in the world, according to the CIA World Factbook. That is just small enough to ensure the country does not receive a lot of large allocations among ETFs offering international exposure. The Guggenheim Shipping ETF, a a fund that is sensitive to macroeconomic trends, features a 10.5% weight to Greece. That makes SEA the ETF with the second-largest Greece exposure after GREK. Stormy seas could await this fund come Monday. iShares MSCI Spain Index Fund (NYSE: EWP) EWP has jumped almost 4.5% in the past week, but the only way this downtrodden fund keeps that momentum going is for global markets to be truly satisfied with the Greek election results. If that does not happen and Greece stamps its ticket out of the Eurozone, traders' attention will shift to Spain on speculation that the country will follow Greece out the door. Spain's bond yields remain elevated and the country is teetering on the brink of a move to non-investment grade status. That means EWP is not to be trusted as anything more than a short-term trade. PowerShares DB Italian Treasury Bond Futures ETN (NYSE: ITLY) ITLY and its leveraged cousin, the PowerShares DB 3x Italian Treasury Bond Futures ETN (NYSE: ITLT), are direct plays on Italy's problems, but the order of the European dominoes appears to be Greece, Spain then Italy. Bottom line: If Greece heads out of the Euro Zone, investors are not going to be putting cash to work with Italian bonds. iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) For much of 2012, gold has behaved like a risk asset, not a safe haven. The yellow metal's risk status has been changing for the better over the past month. The CurrencyShares Euro Trust (NYSE: FXE) is down 1.7% since May 15, but IAU is up 4.3%. Those looking to make a bet against moving to the upside post-Greece elections should consider the PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) or the PowerShares DB Dollar Bullish (NYSE: UUP) as a more conservative option.

2012-08-08,S&P Capital IQ Bullish on Gold Miners,"It is not a secret that shares of gold miner ETFs have performed disappointingly relative to gold futures. And it is also not a secret that this scenario has played out for a long enough time period that calling a bottom in gold miners has been hazardous. However, the prevailing bull case for gold miners says signs of life will soon emerge. In a research note, S&P Capital IQ said it remains positive on gold's outlook for this year and 2013. S&P Capital IQ provided a number of reasons for its bullish outlook on the yellow metal. First, given that the Federal Reserve is committed to keeping short-term interest rates at near zero through 2014, we see no opportunity cost for buying and holding gold anytime soon, S&P said in the note. Second, despite higher gold prices, global mine production has been stagnant for over a decade. According to data compiled by Gold Fields Minerals Service, a U.K.-based metals consulting firm and publisher, global mine output in 2011 totaled 2,809 tons, up eight percent from 2,602 tons in 1999. We believe production will remain stagnant for the next several years, as old mines are becoming depleted and are not being replaced to the extent needed to significantly lift output. S&P also cited volatility among major global currencies and elevated concerns over solvency of international sovereign debt. The research provider added, In our view, the threat of debt defaults increases the appeal of gold as a safe haven asset. In addition, rising money supply in the U.S. could be a catalyst to drive gold higher this year, according to S&P. In terms of individual gold miners, S&P has a five-star rating on Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and four-star ratings on Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) and Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD). Those three stocks combine for about 30 percent of Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). With almost $8.1 billion in assets under management, GDX is the largest ETF tracking gold mining equities. GDX has struggled this year, falling almost 15 percent even as ETFs backed by physical gold have risen. The SPDR Gold shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), the two largest gold ETFs, each rose about three percent year-to-date. Small-cap gold miners have performed even worse than their large-cap counterparts year-to-date. During this period, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) has fallen almost 20 percent. Unlike some of its peers, GDXJ has some mid-cap exposure and allocations to silver miners. The fund has nearly $2.3 billion in AUM. S&P did not include ratings for either gold miner ETF in the research note. For more on mining ETFs, click here."

2012-08-24,A Look Ahead: Next Week's ETFs to Watch,"Stocks closed higher on Friday, but it was not to avoid a weekly loss. A six-week winning streak for equities is now over, but riskier assets got a boost on Friday on speculation the European Central Bank could step up its bond-buying efforts. Add that to rampant hopes the Federal Reserve will engage in a third round of quantitative easing and ample speculation that the Peoples' Bank of China will ease as well and it is easy to see that the near-term outlook for equities lies in the hands of global central banks. Said differently, central banks keep dangling carrots in front of traders and like a pack of hungry rabbits, traders keep falling for the trick. Easing or not, the following ETFs will be worth watching in the week ahead. iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) Or the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) or any other ETF backed by physical gold. IAU, GLD and rival funds got a lift this week on the back of easing hopes. IAU jumped 3.3 percent amid for the simple reason that monetary easing has previously proven to be a boon for gold. What cannot be overlooked is silver's impressive rise. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) surged 9.2 percent this week. With gold on the move higher, poor man's gold (silver) looks poised to follow suit. Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: SOXS) Despite a sharp pullback on Friday, SOXS enjoyed a fine week, gaining almost 4.5 percent. This is not the most important ETF to watch next week, but it bears noting the Nasdaq 100 has been showing signs it wants to pullback. Not to mention, seasonal trends that favor a bearish view on chip stocks are about to kick in. Global X China China Consumer ETF (NYSE: CHIQ) There are well over 200 ETFs offering exposure to China. In theory, many should benefit if the PBOC engages in some form of monetary easing. In reality, many investors will head to the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI). Reality Part II: CHIQ has been eating FXI's lunch. The just completed week is a prime example. CHIQ was up 1.5 percent while FXI lost 1.4 percent. If China eases over the weekend, run to CHIQ Monday morning and avoid FXI. ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) The ETFS Physical Palladium Shares climbed 7.4 percent this week and there are several reasons behind the impressive move. First, as a precious metal, palladium would stand to benefit from QE3. Second, Citigroup endorsed palladium and platinum over South African equities. Third, labor strife in South Africa has been lifting palladium futures. The labor situation in South Africa is one precious metals investors will want to stay abreast of because the country is the world's largest platinum producer and the second-largest palladium producer behind Russia.

2012-08-24,ETFs for Gen X and Gen Y,"While there are no concrete dates of birth that allow one to be considered a member of Generation X, it is generally accepted those born starting in the early 1960s through the early 1980s are Gen X-ers. Millennials, or members of Generation Y, are said to have been born in the late 1970s or 1980s and onward. In other words, there are a lot people out there are not planning for retirement at the moment. Unfortunately, there are some cold realities facing the younger members of Gen X and all of Gen Y. For starters, defined benefit pension plans are a thing of the past. With folks living longer, companies are finding it harder to justify the expense of these plans to shareholders. From 1980 through 2008, the percentage of workers covered by a defined benefit pension plan slid from 38 percent to 20 percent, according to the Social Security Administration. In 2010, only 17 members of the Fortune 100 offered defined benefit pensions. Then there is social security. No matter what politicians from either side of the aisle would lead voters to believe, there is at least a decent chance a good portion of Gen X and all of Gen Y will not receive any social security benefits because the system will be belly-up by the time these workers retire. Fortunately, there are ETFs to help Gen X and Gen Y survive even without lofty pensions and social security. iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) Perhaps a controversial pick because gold does not pay a dividend and commodities are volatile, but there are reasons for long-term investors to consider a gold-backed ETF. First, gold is often viewed as the ultimate inflation-fighting instrument. Second, the balance sheets of many developed world governments, the U.S. included, are putrid. The rising fiscal burdens coming from Washington, D.C. are a drag on the already vulnerable dollar, implying previously unthinkable prices for gold such as $2,500 or $3,000 an ounce are not far-flung concepts. IAU makes the cut because its expense ratio of 0.25 percent is lower than the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and that is important for long-term investors. WisdomTree Dividend ex-Financials Fund (NYSE: DTN) Dividends have to be part of the retirement equation, especially for those that are not getting or pension. If social security falls by the wayside, the importance of dividends will exponentially increase. DTN is compelling option because it excludes financials, a sector that, broadly speaking, still has not regained its pre-financial crisis dividend luster. Predictably, utilities and staples dominate DTN with a combined allocation of over 26 percent, but tech, now the largest dividend-paying sector, represents 10 percent of the fund's weight. DTN, which has $1.2 billion in assets under management, has a 30-day SEC yield of 3.83 percent. Those wanting some exposure to bank stocks can pair DTN with the lower-yielding Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (NYSE: VIG). VIG, the largest dividend ETF by assets, screens candidates based on their dividend track records. In other words, VIG is home to stocks that have paid dividends for decades, not new dividend players such as Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Market Vectors High-Yield Muni ETF (NYSE: HYD) Yes, there have been an increased number of municipal bankruptcies this year and the potential is there for that number to rise in the coming years. All that said, calls for the death of municipal bonds as an asset class have either been very premature or greatly exaggerated as the asset class has been a steady performer this year. Even amid rising municipal bankruptcies, HYD is up 10 percent this year. Earlier this week, Warren Buffett said he is exiting the muni bond market and HYD is up since that announcement. That shows this is a resilient ETF. In lieu of a pension or social security, HYD is a nice backstop with a monthly dividend and a 12-month trailing yield of 5.07 percent. Global X SuperDividend ETF (NYSE: SDIV) The Global X SuperDividend ETF recently joined the $100 million in AUM club, but that is not the real story with these ETF. A monthly dividend payer, SDIV offers a yield that few other dividend ETFs can even get close to. As of August 22, SDIV had a 12-month yield of 7.87 percent and a 30-day SEC yield of 7.65 percent as of July 31, according to Global X data. WisdomTree Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund (NYSE: ELD) ETFs featuring emerging markets debt not denominated in U.S. dollars have surged in popularity as investors look to allocate some of their portfolios away from the greenback. The fact that many emerging market governments have sound balance sheets is a plus and improving credit ratings only make EM debt more attractive. ELD, the second-largest actively managed ETF on the market, allocates about 40 percent of its weight to Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia and Indonesia. Another monthly dividend payer, ELD's 30-day SEC yield is close to four percent. ELD charges 0.55 percent per year. Investors looking to save a few basis points could consider the Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond ETF (NYSE: EMLC). EMLC, which is not actively managed, charges 0.49 percent. Brazil, Poland, South Africa and Mexico combine for 40 percent of EMLC's weight. For more on ETFs, click here."
2012-08-28,3 Precious Metals ETFs Your Broker Forgot to Mention,"With $68.9 billion in assets under management, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) is the second-largest ETF in the world. The iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) is not exactly tiny with $10 billion in AUM, nor can the $9.5 billion iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) be considered diminutive. On the mining front, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has almost $8.4 billion in AUM while the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is home to a healthy $2.6 billion in assets. In other words, it is unusual to find an exchange-traded product that offers exposure to the precious metals complex that can be considered anonymous or obscure. Whether its a futures play, a fund backed by physical holdings or an equity-based fund, there are a few precious metals ETFs and ETNs out there that brokers and investors probably have not heard of. With gold and silver looking as though they want to make new highs, there is no time like the present to become acquainted with some new precious metals plays. ETFS Physical White Metals Basket Shares (NYSE: WITE) For the investor that already has gold exposure and just cannot decide between the white metals, there is the ETFS Physical White Metals Basket Shares. Nearly two-years-old, WITE uses a basket approach to give investors exposure to silver, platinum and palladium. WITE currently holds almost 49,500 ounces of silver, 495 ounces of platinum and 396 ounces of palladium, according to ETF Securities data. Despite the soaring popularity of precious metals ETFs in recent years, WITE has struggled to capture investors' attention. The fund has just over $34 million in AUM and average daily volume below 1,900 shares. That shows investors are missing out on a good thing as WITE is up nine percent year-to-date. PowerShares DB Precious Metals Fund (NYSE: DBP) With almost $323 million in AUM, calling the PowerShares DB Precious Metals Fund anonymous is a stretch. Overlooked might be the more appropriate descriptor. Where DBP differs from funds such as GLD and SLV is its fees. DBP charges 0.79 percent per year, which is high among metals funds, particularly when considering DBP has no storage costs. Then again, futures-based exchange-traded products have a reputation for high fees and DBP does live up to that billing. The fund tracks the DBIQ Optimum Yield Precious Metals Index, which is 80 percent allocated to gold and 20 percent allocated to silver. DBP is up 6.3 percent year-to-date, but that is barely better than GLD and more than 400 basis points worse than SLV. iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund (NYSE: RING) The iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund is another good example of a new ETF that has shown it will be around for a while, though it is debatable that many investors even know that much about this mining play. RING debuted in late January and now has $32.4 million in AUM. That is not a bad haul, but that total also indicates RING has its hands full in terms of competing with GDX's first-to-market advantage. GDX and RING actually make for an interesting competition. RING's 0.39 percent expense ratio is 13 basis points below GDX's, but the Market Vectors fund has sharply outperformed the iShares ETF over the past three months. At the very least, RING is off to a better start than the iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP). SLVP has made almost no inroads on the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL), the dominant silver miners fund. For more on mining ETFs, click here."

2012-09-04,ETFs to Watch This Week,"Last week was another week at the central bank office for stocks and ETFs. Stocks rallied on Friday, but closed with a weekly loss as investors were again left to ponder when additional monetary easing will arrive. As has been par for the course, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank stands ready to act. However, Bernanke stopped short of making the announcement nearly everyone wants to hear: That more quantitative easing is on the way. With no official announcement on QE3, traders are left pointing to the Fed's next meeting in mid-September as a possible release date for for QE3. By that time, Bernanke's hand might be forced. The August jobs report, due out next Friday, and September's tradition of being unkind to stocks could prompt the Fed to launch QE3. For now, traders will have to wait and see, but the following ETFs have the potential to excite in some form or fashion this week. iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) The iShares Gold Trust finished the week higher by almost 1.5 percent, but that gain was entirely attributable to Friday's Bernanke-induced 2.2 percent pop. With the Eurozone debt crisis still front and center in the eyes of many investors, a strong case can be made that gold does not necessarily need QE3 to move higher. On the other hand, it is obvious additional dollar-depressing stimulus would be a boon for hard assets such as gold. On better than double the average daily volume on Friday, IAU closed at its highest level since April. IAU is benefiting from the hope that QE3 will arrive and as long as Bernanke does not overtly rule the idea out, the yellow metal does have near-term upside. Global X SuperDividend ETF (NYSE: SDIV) SDIV closed the week on a down note, but only modestly so, and it seems to be going unnoticed that volume in this ETF is on the upswing. For example, SDIV gained 0.6 percent on Friday on turnover that was nearly triple the daily average. What cannot be ignored is a trailing 12-month yield on SDIV of almost eight percent. That is more than quadruple the dividend yield on the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). With dividends still in style and volume increasing, SDIV could print a new 52-week high as soon as next week. Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) With all the talk of a slowing Chinese economy, the Eurozone's ills and sluggish growth in the U.S., it is not surprising the Market Vectors Steel ETF has been pummeled. The fund is down 16.4 percent year-to-date, making an endorsement of the fund's fundamentals a tricky proposition. Fundamentals aside, SLX does offer an alluring technical setup for the aggressive trader. If the ETF once again finds support in the $40-$41 area, it could have upside to $45-$46. Direxion Daily Emerging Markets Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: EDZ) There are still individual opportunities worth considering within the emerging markets ETF universe, but the overall near-term outlook for the group is cloudy. India's GDP report earlier this week failed to illicit any excitement. China bulls are stuck in the same spot U.S. investors are and that is hoping for easing and or interest rate cuts. In other words, there is more potential for disappointment than pleasant surprise out of broader emerging markets ETFs. EDZ offers short-term protection from that trend at a decent price.

2012-09-07,September Could be Kind to These ETFs,"On a historical basis, September is usually unkind to stocks and investors have been reminded of that in ample doses since the start of the month. The good news is September's sour reputation does not mean there are not opportunities to be had. In fact, there are a few ETFs that can comfort investors this month. Perhaps the best thing is that the funds on this list are not leveraged, so conservative investors can embrace a couple of these picks, too. Here are the ETFs to be involved with from the long side this month: iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) Or the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) or any ETF backed by physical gold for that matter. IAU makes the cut here because it has a lower expense ratio than GLD. Additionally, IAU has slightly outperformed GLD year-to-date. Regardless of which gold ETF investors choose, historical data indicate gold is a wise move from the long side this month. In the past 25 Septembers, gold prices have increased 19 times. Factoring in the six years when gold prices slid in September, gold's average September gain is almost 2.7 percent, according to Dorsey Wright. iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index Fund (NYSE: IYR) The real estate sector has been a decent performer over the past 20 Septembers, rising 12 times and falling on eight occasions. The average gain in the 12 up Septembers outpaces the average loss by 50 basis points, according to Dorsey Wright. IYR is already up 17.3 percent year-to-date and that might imply the fund is due for a September pullback. Past performance probably is not the biggest near-term risk facing this ETF. Valuation might be. IYR sports a P/E ratio of almost 45 and a price/book ratio of nearly 3.5, according to iShares data. On the other hand, a 30-day SEC yield of 3.56 percent is decent in this environment and that could be enough to send yield-hungry investors into this fund as September moves along. U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) Embracing a risky asset such as oil futures would appear to be the opposite of what would be deemed a practical September. The data support such a move. Over the past 16 Septembers, oil futures have risen nine times and fallen seven times. Not a big margin favor of the bulls, but the Dorsey Wright data indicate crude's average gain over those nine Septembers is 120 basis points better than the average loss. PowerShares DWA Technical Leaders Portfolio (NYSE: PDP) The PowerShares DWA Technical Leaders Portfolio tracks an index based on relative strength methodology, which is to say the ETF is home to 101 stocks showing bullish relative strength characteristics. On the surface, PDP would be appear to be a fund more geared toward a risk on environment because consumer discretionary and financial services names combine for almost 50 percent of the ETF's weight. The index has jumped in 10 of the past 15 Septembers, though it should be noted the average loss in the five down Septembers is much higher than the average gain. PDP has almost $617 million in assets under management and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the ETF's largest holding with an allocation of 3.53 percent. For more on ETFs, click here."
2012-09-07,"Vanguard Won't Topple iShares, Not Soon Anyway","With football season here, talk of rivalries will soon be upon sports fans. Avid followers of the exchange-traded products industry are treated to rivalries on a daily basis, but there is one that grabs most of the attention. That is the competition between BlackRock's (NYSE: BLK) iShares unit, the largest ETF sponsor, and Vanguard, the third-largest ETF issuer. Vanguard is a relatively new entrant to the ETF arena, but its rise to stardom has been nothing short of impressive. Rock-bottom fees on its sector and broad market ETF have helped Vanguard pilfer assets from rivals such as iShares. Commission-free trading on Vanguard ETFs for the firm's clients has helped, too. Vanguard had almost $220.6 billion in AUM as of September 5, according to Index Universe data. Said another way, the next 10 largest ETF sponsors could have their AUM totals combined and the number would still be far below Vanguard's. Vanguard is big in ETFs. iShares is bigger...a lot bigger. With all the speculation that the former will topple the latter, critical facts are being overlooked and those facts go beyond the $200 billion AUM chasm between the two firms. Yes, Vanguard (and other ETF sponsors for that matter) has a primary advantage over iShares in terms expense ratios. Cost is exactly the reason why the Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: VWO) long ago wrestled the crown of largest emerging markets ETF away from the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM). Even today it is obvious that iShares has been slow to learn its expense ratio lesson. As just one example, the annual fees on the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Energy Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYE) are 0.47 percent. The Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSE: VDE) charges just 0.19 percent. A Good Starting Point It is the topic of fees that is a good starting point for why Vanguard has its work cut out for it in terms of becoming home to more AUM than iShares. Part of the issue is that the Vanguard versus iShares tussle all but ignores State Street's (NYSE: STT) State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), the second-largest ETF sponsor. To use another sports analogy, if Vanguard and iShares were running the 100-meter dash in the Olympics, the commentators would be ignoring the silver medal winner (SSgA) while implying the bronze medal winner (Vanguard) stands a better chance of winning gold in the next Olympics. And if it is a matter of cost, than SSgA wins in terms of sector funds. All of the sector SPDRs, familiar ETFs such as the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) and Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK), are cheaper than the comparable Vanguard ETFs. Sure, the difference is just one basis point, but the select sector SPDRs are still cheaper than the Vanguard equivalents. In addition, SSgA issues products that Vanguard does not have and even if the latter decided to encroach on the territory of some of these funds, the uphill climb would be incredibly steep. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) has $70.2 billion in AUM, making it the second-largest ETF in the world of any kind. Vanguard has no GLD equivalent. Yes, SSgA has been in the ETF game longer and funds such as GLD and the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) have given the firm a nice first mover advantage. As of September 5, SSgA had almost $300.3 billion in AUM, the Index Universe data show. That is an almost $80 billion lead on Vanguard. The market cap of General Mills (NYSE: GIS) could be multiplied three times and the resulting number still would not be enough for Vanguard to pass SSgA. Other Advantages There are other factors that indicate a toppling of iShares by Vanguard will either take more years than most care to admit or will never come to pass. Yes, VWO has crushed EEM on the basis of lower fees, but Vanguard's emerging markets lineup is not extensive. With the exception of a few country funds issued by other providers, iShares is THE name when it comes to emerging markets ETFs. That is not to say the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ) or the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) are the best ETFs tracking those countries, but they are the ones investors are most familiar with. Despite the success of VWO, Vanguard has not gone deeper into the emerging markets arena. Next is the issue of commodities ETFs, which was mentioned in relation to GLD. iShares has the most popular GLD rival in the form of the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) and the dominant silver ETF in the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV). Vanguard has no SLV answer, either. Another area where Vanguard will have a tough time getting to the second spot, let alone passing iShares, is bond ETFs. To be certain, Vanguard's bond ETF lineup is stout and features plenty of low-fee options. That lineup also lacks a worthy competitor to the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE: HYG) and the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE: JNK). Vanguard also currently lacks some of the niche bond concepts some ETF sponsors have rolled out this year. The firm offers no international high-yield bond ETFs, but iShares and Van Eck's Market Vectors do. Vanguard has no bond fund devoted to emerging markets corporate debt. WisdomTree (NASDAQ: WETF), iShares and SSgA all have funds that focus on that niche. None of this is to say Vanguard is irrelevant. It certainly is not and investors have benefited from the firm's growing presence in the ETF industry. Vanguard will continue playing a pivotal role in the ETF universe and investors will continue to enjoy the benefits of the firm's low-cost funds. All of that can happen from Vanguard's perch as the third-largest ETF firm, the place it is likely to stay for quite a while. For more on ETFs, click here."
2012-09-10,Even Hedge Fund Legends Make ETF Mistakes,"It is safe to say that legendary investors such as Ray Dalio, George Soros and John Paulson did not become legends by making a lot of mistakes. Investing is not baseball, meaning the great players have to be great more than 30 percent of the time. Typically, the greatest names in the hedge fund business are great a lot more than 30 percent of the time. However, that does not mean they are perfect. Every investing legend has had a flub or two along the way, which implies these guys are human, too. One area where some hedge fund giants are making mistakes is with ETFs. Not by using ETFs, but with the ETFs they are choosing. Here are some examples of the mistakes, admittedly some are small, that big-time hedge fund managers have made with ETFs. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) The SPDR Gold Shares is the second-largest ETF in the world as ranked by assets under management, so it is not surprising this fund finds its way into the portfolios of pros and retail investors alike. Paulson's Paulson & Co. held 21.8 million shares of GLD at the end of the second quarter. That is not a bad bet at all given that gold has been surging recently on speculation of a third round of quantitative easing. However, long-term gold investors, of which Paulson appears to be one, are better off with the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). IAU charges just 0.25 percent per year compared to 0.4 percent charged by GLD. Year-to-date, IAU has outperformed GLD by nearly 30 basis points. It is not just Paulson making this minor error. Soros also held a stake in GLD at the end of the second quarter. Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) Like GLD, the financial Select Sector SPDR is a large, familiar ETF. With $7.2 billion in AUM, XLF is the largest ETF tracking major bank stocks. With an expense ratio of 0.18 percent, XLF is also the cheapest financial services ETF. Neither factor makes XLF the best financial services fund. Tudor Jones Investment, the hedge fund managed by Paul Tudor Jones, took a stake of 8.66 million shares in XLF in the first quarter. That position has performed well, but in the past three months XLF has been slightly outpaced by the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE: KRE) and thoroughly trounced by the PowerShares KBW Bank ETF (NYSE: KBWB). The difference between KBWB's and XLF's 90-day performance is nearly 300 basis points. iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ) EWZ, the largest ETF tracking Latin America's largest economy, was on the receiving end of some positive pressafter it was revealed Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates took a stake in the fund during the second quarter. Bridgewater bought 2 million shares of EWZ during the second quarter at average price of $56. Based on current prices, the position is slightly underwater. No big deal since Bridgewater has $120 billion in AUM, meaning EWZ accounts for a scant percentage of its total portfolio. Still, the Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: BRF) would have been the better bet for Dalio. BRF has outperformed EWZ since the start of the second quarter. In the past 90 days, the difference is 630 basis points in favor of BRF. For more on ETFs, click here."
2012-09-12,Market Meanders Ahead of Fed Minutes,"U.S. equities eked out small gains Wednesday, the day before the Federal Open Market Committee releases minutes from its two-day meeting. The S&P 500 added three points, or 0.2 percent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10 points, or less than 0.1 percent. The Nasdaq could only muster a gain of about 10 points, a third of a percent, despite the debut of Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) iPhone 5. Shares of Apple, the world's largest company by market value, climbed 1.4 percent and closed just pennies of the highest levels of the day. While the new iPhone is lighter, thinner with a bigger screen and increased speeds, the phone may be guilty of only meeting analysts' and investors' expectations rather than exceeding them. However, it is worth noting Apple shares have had a tendency to languish immediately following major product announcements only to rally thereafter. Still, the new iPhone has the potential to be a major driver of Apple's stock price going forward. David Garrity of GVA Research said 60 million or more units could ship before year-end. In other stock-specific news, shares of apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF) jumped 5.4 percent on volume that was more than quadruple the daily average after it was reported the company hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS). Abercrombie's reason for hiring the bank is not yet known, but there is speculation the firm made the move due to pressure from an activist investor. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) closed modestly higher after the semiconductor maker narrowed its third-quarter revenue guidance to $3.27-$3.41 billion from $3.21-$3.47 billion. The company raised its EPS forecast to 38-42 cents from 34-42 cents. Analysts are expecting earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $3.34 billion. Shares of data storage provider Xyratex (NASDAQ: XRTX) tumbled 10.2 percent on volume that was more than double the daily average after the company lowered its third-quarter revenue guidance to $271-$276 million from previous guidance of $313-$373 million. Analysts are expecting revenue of $344.5 million. Ahead of the FOMC minutes, commodities ETFs were mixed as the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) closed slightly higher, but the U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) settled fractionally lower. The PowerShares DB Dollar Bullish (NYSE: UUP) closed slightly lower on heavy volume. The Fed will probably announce a third round of bond purchases tomorrow, according to almost two-thirds of economists in a Bloomberg survey."
2012-09-17,Will QE3 Spur These EM ETFs Higher?,"Quantitative easing, no matter the edition, is viewed as an impetus for investors to get involved with riskier assets. Last Thursday's surge in equities and commodities proved as much and it is no secret that QE3 is expected to benefit myriad sector ETFs. Investors with an eye toward global markets might be wondering if monetary easing in this form can benefit international ETFs, particularly those focusing on emerging markets. It is a relevant question to ask in the wake of the QE3 announcement because plenty of developing markets and the ETFs that track them are correlated to the commodities trade. Of course, past performance is no predictor of future results, but a look back at how some emerging markets funds performed under QE2 could provide clues for what investors can expect under QE3. Note the QE2 returns mentioned here are from the deployment of QE2 in November 2010 through the completion of the program in June 2011. iShares MSCI Chile Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: ECH) On the basis that quantitative easing should stoke higher commodities prices then QE3 should be good news for the iShares MSCI Chile Investable Market Index Fund. The reason is simple: Chile is the world's largest copper producer. There is a rub, though. QE3 is an American phenomenon, but it is China that is the 800-pound gorilla in the copper market. China has announced a major infrastructure stimulus program, which could drive ECH higher in the future. China's stimulus, not American easing, is what ECH bulls may need to pin their hopes on because the ETF returned just 3.7 percent under QE2. On the other hand, the Chilean economy has more to offer than just copper. Home to a vibrant banking sector and improving domestic demand, Chile's central bank recently boosted its 2012 GDP growth forecast while reducing its inflation estimate. iShares MSCI All Peru Capped Index Fund (NYSE: EPU) Staying in South America, the iShares MSCI All Peru Capped Index Fund would appear to be another logical beneficiary of QE3. Peru is a major copper producer and one of the world's top gold and silver producers. EPU's correlation to those precious metals can vary. For example, EPU has outperformed the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) by wide margins over the past year. In the past six months, the script has flipped as IAU and SLV have easily outpaced EPU. Still, it is worth noting EPU has already benefited from QE3. The ETF was trading around $42 before the announcement. It now trades over $45. During QE2, however, EPU gave up 4.5 percent. Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX) Given Russia's status as the largest non-OPEC oil producer in the world, any and all Russia ETFs would seem to be logical QE3 derivative plays. ETFs heavy on U.S.-based oil and gas producers such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) and the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP) have performed well in the wake of the QE3 headlines, offering confirmation that Russia ETFs could offer more upside. The $1 million question is how much upside? That question needs to be answered because in the case of RSX, a case can be made that this ETF was pricing in QE3 before the announcement was made. RSX surged 12 percent in the three months leading up to the QE3 news and has since tacked another five percent. During QE2, the largest Russia-specific ETF added almost 7.5 percent. iShares MSCI Thailand Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: THD) Thailand is not known for being a raw materials export as are the other countries on this list. Additionally, a case can be made that THD is steadier and less volatile than either EPU or RSX. There is a QE3 angle with THD worth noting. CIMB Research upgraded Thai energy and petrochemicals names today to Trading Buy from Neutral, citing the onset of QE3, Reuters reported. Energy and materials are THD's second- and third-largest sector weights, respectively, combing for over 31 percent of the ETF's total weight. THD gained 6.8 percent during QE2.

2012-09-21,Investing in Gold After QE3,"Many investors have hit the sidelines to watch whether or not the eurozone will dodge increasing doubts about its bailout agreements It's been just four trading days since QE3 ended and gold prices are already up about $40 an ounce. Prior to the announcement, gold was trading at six-month highs, but dipped slightly before Thursday's anticipated news. Upon hearing the Fed's decision, gold prices shot up 2% that day. Here we are on Tuesday and gold prices have slightly dipped with Comex December futures declining $4.50 to $1,766.10 an ounce. Many investors have hit the sidelines to watch whether or not the eurozone will dodge increasing doubts about its bailout agreements. But we're still a long way from the long-term price target for gold. Can this QE-fueled rise match ones for QE1 and QE2? History does have a way of repeating itself... Gold prices and the QE3 rally Société Générale analysts recently wrote, Gold prices are highly sensitive to the evolution of the monetary base, which expands during quantitative easing. During QE1 and QE2, gold prices increased 36% and 21% respectively. Just prior to the QE2 announcement ($600 billion or $75 billion per month) in November 2010, gold was trading at $1,355 an ounce and at the end of the run in June 2011, was approximately at $1,500. But with gold moving so high before the QE3 news, some of its stimulus-induced rally happened already. Using QE2 as guidance for potential gains for gold prices, gold is likely to have priced in the bulk of its move higher, Suki Cooper, a precious metals analyst at Barclays Capital, told Reuters. But that doesn't mean other factors won't push it higher long-term. Cooper added that between an increase for the physical demand in China and India as well as record-high holdings in gold-backed exchange-traded products, gold will likely hold on to its strength, even if it doesn't climb at the same fast pace. Plus, central bank action around the world is making gold a screaming Buy. Prior to the Fed's announcement, a German court gave the thumbs-up for the $645 billion European Stability Mechanism. Following the Fed's decision, rumors immediately swirled that Japan and Bank of England may issue stimulus measures. Plus there's a China factor. The Asian powerhouse has recently implied an additional stimulus measure may be coming to prevent its economy from slowing down further. QE3 is also different from previous Fed stimulus programs as bond purchases will remain open-ended, and the Fed presented guidance to keep low rates until 2015. While the Fed plans to keep QE3 going as long as unemployment is a problem, that looks to be an incredibly long timeframe. That little unemployment problem of an 8.1% jobless rate isn't going away. On Tuesday, the Bank of America came out with research predicting a gold rise to $2,400 a troy ounce by the end of 2014 thanks to QE3. On the downside, it isn't likely to go below $1,500. Gold-related investments for post-QE3 Since the Fed's announcement, gold ETFs have been on the rise. As reported in ETF Trends, the physically-backed SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust(NYSE: IAU) have both gained 3.9% in the past week and about 9.0% over the past month. If stocks are more your thing, there are some gold miners on the rise: IAMGOLD Corp. (NYSE: IAG), Tanzanian Royalty Exploration Corp. (TRX) and Golden Star Resources Ltd. (GSS). Investors should get used to pricier gold. While some dips could appear due to occasional profit-taking, its long-term bull run continues."
2012-09-24,Bank of America Sees ETF Assets at $2.5 Trillion Within 5 Years,"Less than two years removed from topping the $1 trillion in assets under management mark for the first time, U.S.-listed exchange-traded products are now home nearly $1.3 trillion in combined AUM. Analysts at Bank of America think that number could almost double to $2.5 trillion in five years. In a research note published last week, BofA said that in 2012, overall U.S. ETF assets have increased roughly 24 percent through a combination of price appreciation and flows. The bank expects U.S. ETF assets to jump by $230 billion over the next year and reach $2.5 trillion within the next five years. The ETF Big Three of BlackRock's (NYSE: BLK) iShares unit, State Street's (NYSE: STT) State Street Global Advisors arm and Vanguard have been prolific at garnering new inflows this year with Vanguard leading the charge. Year to date we have seen all of the big three grow in terms of assets with Vanguard leading with a 51 percent increase in assets and State Street and BlackRock having asset growth of 23 percent and 18 percent, respectively, according to the note. As a percent of assets, BlackRock's ytd flows are about 7 percent, State Street is not to far away with 9 percent but Vanguard is much higher with year-to-date flows of 26 percent of assets. BofA expects Vanguard's low-cost structure to pressure rival ETF sponsors to reduce fees as well. Earlier this month, BlackRock announced it pared fees on some of its ETFs in the fourth quarter. Last week, Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW) announced its own expense reduction for some of its ETFs. Still, it is worth noting that lower fees do not always lead to higher AUM totals, something BofA points out in its research. There have been some examples of fee compression among ETFs that track very similar benchmarks. We have found this to be true for some very specific cases, but fees are generally only one of a few factors in the competition for assets. There are some examples of the importance of fees in the competition for assets, but for most ETFs we do not see a clear link between expenses and fund flows due to factors such as fund structure, optimization strategy, securities lending practices, tracking error, creation/redemption mechanism (in-kind or cash), etc., according to the note. There are real-world examples of cheap not always being better. A prominent example includes the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY), the world's largest ETF by assets. SPY, which has $118.6 billion in AUM, is slightly more expensive than the iShares S&P 500 Index Fund (NYSE: IVV) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: VOO), but SPY is far larger than both. In the case of IVV, SPY is more than triple the size of that fund. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) charges 0.4 percent per year, 15 basis points more than the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). However, GLD is the world's second-largest ETF with almost $74 billion in AUM compared to $11.4 billion in AUM for IAU. The BofA noted said bond ETFs have grown by 28 percent in AUM terms this year while equity funds have grown by 25 percent. Commodities ETFs have increased AUM totals by 15 percent.

2012-12-03,A Year-End Rally Could Jolt These ETFs Higher ,"With the start of a new month comes the opportunity for investors to evaluate those ETFs that have established track records of solid performance in December. The pickings are ample as the last month of the year is usually one of the best for stocks with S&P 500 rising in 16 of the previous 20 Decembers. Before getting too excited, it should be noted that the Stock Trader's Almanac points out the stocks lose some of their December zest in presidential election years. As has been duly noted, seasonal trends work in favor of the investors that acknowledge those trends. For example, energy stocks usually decline in November. What did the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) do last month? It fell 1.22 percent. Keep that type of concept in mind when shopping for December winners. The list can start with the following ETFs. PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) This will be the ninth December in which the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) has traded. Over the previous eight, the world's second-largest ETF by assets has a decidedly mixed track record having risen on four occasions while having tumbled four times. With that type of breakdown it is clearly hard to endorse a bullish position in gold as a short-term December trade. However, those that are committed to GLD or an equivalent fund such as the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) for the long-term can consider the PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN as a short-term hedge against a long gold position. In an ideal scenario, DZZ will rise this month and investors will be deep enough in the money to hold the ETN until next year to stave off 2012 short-term capital gains. PowerShares Dynamic Media Portfolio (NYSE: PBS) The PowerShares Dynamic Media Portfolio has been one of the better-performing sector funds this year with a gain of almost 25.5 percent. That shows the ETF has lived up to the hype of being a play on election year advertising and the release of some marquee films. Sitting on a gain of 25.5 percent, it might appear that PBS is ripe for some year-end profit taking, but that may not be the case. First, fund managers that are up on media stocks will likely look to push the tax consequences of those winning positions out to to 2013. Second, the media sector has posted an average gain of over three percent over the past 20 Decembers while outperforming the S&P 500 nearly two-thirds of the time, according to Bloomberg. iShares Dow Jones U.S. Medical Devices Index Fund (NYSE: IHI) As Bloomberg noted, December is usually quite kind to health care equipment names. The sub-sector posts an average gain in the last month of the year of nearly 3.6 percent and has outpaced the S&P 500 in more than 72 percent of the previous 20 Decembers. Savvy short-sellers will let unknowing bulls run the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Medical Devices Index Fund higher this month there are ominous clouds on the horizon for the medical device industry. As Benzinga has previously reported, Obamacare contains punitive, GDP-draining tax on IHI constituents that could prompt the loss of tens of thousands of jobs while crimping the profits of the ETF's holdings. The tax becomes effective in January and has already resulted in preemptive layoffs from some of IHI's holdings. In other words, medical device may honor their seasonal tendency to rise in December. Just do not bet on the good times lasting too far into 2013. For more on ETFs, click here."
2012-12-12,This ETF Could be The Real Monetary Easing Play,"While the market seemed generally unimpressed by the Federal Reserve's pledge to hold interest rates down until the U.S. unemployment rate drops below 6.5 percent, the usual suspects among ETFs performed as expected Wednesday. Following the conclusion of the central bank's last monetary policy meeting of 2012, the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP), the ETF equivalent of the U.S. Dollar Index, fell almost 0.2 percent on above average turnover. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) closed slightly higher. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) impressed with a gain of 1.4 percent on strong volume. There is another near-term option for traders looking to take advantage of monetary easing and it arguably has nothing to do with the Fed. Emphasis on near-term, but it is worth noting the ProShares UltraShort Yen (NYSE: YCS) surged 1.5 percent on volume that was better than triple the daily average on Wednesday. In the process, the ProShares UltraShort Yen broke through resistance in the $46 area to close at $46.72. That is the highest closing print for YCS since April. The utility of YCS, which in the words of its issuer seeks daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to two times the inverse (-2x) of the daily performance of the U.S. Dollar price of the yen, is clear. Japan, the world's third-largest economy, is scheduled to hold elections on Sunday December 16. Given recent price action in YCS, it would appear forex traders are pricing in victory for Shinzo Abe in his quest to become prime minister again and for Abe's Liberal Democratic Party. Should Abe emerge victorious, the yen will likely plummet because Abe has been vocal in his desire to weaken his country's currency. In fact, Abe is a dream come true for quantitative easing addicts because he has called on the Bank of Japan to engage in unlimited easing. Recent polls suggest Abe will win and that Japan's ruling Democratic party will suffer significant losses. That is good news for YCS. Proper trading of YCS revolves around remembering two key points. First, YCS is a leveraged ETF just like the more widely known Direxion Daily Financial 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: FAZ) or the ProShares UltraShort S&P500 (NYSE: SDS). That means YCS is best used as a short-term instrument not a long-term investment. Second, the yen has a penchant for short-term declines when the Bank of Japan intervenes in the currency market or when rhetoric, such as Abe's, is favorable. However, the Japanese currency has been strong in recent years. YCS has a plain vanilla counterpart, the CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (NYSE: FXY). FXY's daily chart is a train wreck, but over the life of that ETF, it has surged 40.5 percent. Perhaps Abe will be able to affect real downside for the yen, but until that becomes clear, treat YCS as a trade because the near-term forecast is sunny. Worry about the long-term outlook another day. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-01-15,S&P Sees Further Upside For Gold,"While major gold ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) have been lethargic to start 2013, leading some traders to ponder the fate of the yellow metal's 12-year winning streak, some analysts and investors still see upside ahead for gold. Not surprisingly, part of the near-term bull case for gold centers around the Federal Reserve's plans to keep interest rates near zero through 2015. Given that the Federal Reserve is committed to keeping short-term interest rates at near zero through 2015, we see no opportunity cost for buying and holding gold anytime soon. Low short-term interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold as an investment, S&P Capital IQ said in a research note. S&P Capital IQ does not have ratings on the marquee gold mining ETFs, such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), but the research firm sees opportunities with what previously been a disappointing group among sector ETFs. Despite higher gold prices, global mine production has been stagnant for over a decade, said the research firm. We believe production will remain stagnant for the next several years, as old mines are becoming depleted and are not being replaced to the extent needed to significantly lift output. Through the first three quarters of 2012, mine production fell 1.9%. The research firm sees countries, such as China, with large dollar reserves looking to diversify away from the greenback and into larger gold holdings. Additionally, we think that gold will rise in all currencies due to the implementation of quantitative easing by central banks worldwide, S&P said. S&P is bullish on some individual gold miners, including Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD), both of which garner four-star S&P ratings. S&P has a three-star rating on Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM). Barrick is GDX's largest holding with a weight of almost 12.1 percent. Newmont is that ETF's third-largest holding with an allocation of nearly eight percent. Despite gold futures rising over the past year, the $8.7 billion GDX is off 15 percent in that time. The more volatile GDXJ has been even worse, tumbling 23.1 percent over the same time. However, some traders have noted an uptick in share creations for GDXJ in recent weeks, a potentially bullish sign. Additionally, S&P notes that GDXJ could outperform GDX in a rapidly rising gold price environment. GDXJ has $2.5 billion in assets and an annual expense ratio of 0.54 percent.

2013-02-20,Gold's Death Cross Hastens Mining ETFs Death Spirals,"The big news out of the gold pits Wednesday is that futures violated the psychologically important $1,600 an ounce level. At this writing, Comex-traded gold is trading just under $1,568 per ounce. Arguably, the bigger news is the technical condition gold's slide has caused. That being the ominous death cross, the technical scenario under which a security's 50-day moving average falls below its 200-day line. It happened with gold futures and it would appear that it is just a matter of time before the same fate befalls the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Not surprisingly, gold trading at six-month lows and violating key technical areas has proven to be another nail in the coffin of gold mining ETFs. Earlier this month, Benzinga reported on looming technical issues for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). That report cited a technical analyst that said if GDX, the largest gold miners ETF by assets, fellow below $42.15, the bad times could keep on coming. As of Wednesday, that call has proven to be 100 accurate. GDX is off four percent in late trading and trading around $37.80. Should GDX closed below $38 today, it will be the first time the ETF has done that since July 2009. GDX's all-time low of $17.80 seen in October 2008 is obviously a long way off, but at around $38, the ETF is trading near a price that it saw soon after its May 2006 debut. Regarding the death cross, GDX beat bullion to the punch, having committed that offense early this year. GDX is not alone. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is off 3.8 percent today and is trading at $16 as of this writing. That would be a new all-time closing low for the ETF, which debuted in November 2009. If GDXJ closes right at $16, it will have lost 38.4 percent since coming to market. Like GDX, GDXJ made its death cross several weeks. Weakness in gold mining shares, a prominent theme for two years now, if not longer, and that weakness can be felt at the highest levels of the hedge fund universe. As Benzinga reported last week, George Soros has been paring his exposure to GDX and GDXJ. Investors in David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital may be hoping that the hedge fund is behind some of today's selling pressure in GDX. Greenlight owned about 6 million shares of GDX at the end of the fourth quarter, according to a recent 13F filing. That position, if Greenlight still maintains it, is certainly worth less today than it was at the end of last year. GDX spent much of October and November trading in the high $40s and low $50s before diving to the mid $40s in December. Not surprisingly, today's worst offender in the gold mining ETF realm is a leveraged play, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT). Down over 10 percent today and more than 34 percent in the past month, NUGT languishes below $6 a share. In the world of leveraged ETFs, a fund with that price tag will only keep it for so long before it travels down Reverse Split Boulevard. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) will not be seeing a reverse split anytime soon. DUST, the one gold mining ETF that is worth a look these days, is up 51.5 percent in the past month and that does NOT include today's 12.1 percent gain. For more on mining ETFs, click here."

2013-03-18,A Look Ahead: This Week's ETFs to Watch,"U.S. stocks ended last week on a slightly downbeat note, but Friday's glum action was a mere bump on the road of more weekly gains for the major U.S. indexes. Investors might want to cherish the memory of those gains, at least for the next day or two, because Monday's open could be nasty one. Once a gain, a small Eurozone member is seen roiling global equity markets as Cyprus, an island nation of just 1 million citizens, is flirting with a run on its banks. That is because Cyprus' parliament, on Sunday, delayed a vote on taxing bank deposits at a rate of 6.75 percent for deposits under $131,000 and 9.9 percent for deposits over that amount. Those are the conditions of a bailout program agreed to buy the sixteen other Eurozone nations and the International Monetary Fund. If Cyprus does not comply, it could go bankrupt and be sent packing from the Eurozone. And there is one obvious reason why stocks and other risky assets could struggle today. With that in mind, here are a few of the ETFs to keep an eye on in the week ahead. ProShares UltraShort MSCI Europe (NYSE: EPV) One reason Cyprus' banks are ailing is over $5 billion in bad bets on Greek debt. Neither Cyprus, nor Greece command significant percentages in the Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE: VGK), the ETF that the ProShares UltraShort MSCI Europe is double-leveraged inverse equivalent of. That does not matter because Sunday's Asian session, which included a plunging euro, a soaring U.S. dollar and tumbling S&P 500 futures, indicates even tiny Cyprus could be a significant near-term hurdle for the bulls. EPV looked liked it had potential to deliver for traders in late February on the back of the Italian election results, but upside did not materialize in impressive fashion. Still, EPV is in an ideal situation to move higher this week. Two areas to watch: Resistance at $25 for EPV and support at $49 for VGK. Breaks of those price levels could mean a very tough week in which to be long. iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) Gold's trials and tribulations to start 2013 are well-documented. The bears love it and the gold bugs are getting pensive and worrying that bullion's 12-year bull run could be at an end. Last week, Barclays slashed its gold price target to $1,646 per ounce from $1,778, saying the yellow metal lacks catalysts. Cyprus certainly qualifies as a catalyst. Gold rising above $1,600 per ounce for part of Monday's Asian session proves as much. Not to mention, traders appear to be doing some dip buying in gold. Hedge funds and other market participants boosted net long exposure to gold across 18 U.S. futures and options in the week ended March 12 by 30 percent to 528,680 contracts, the biggest gain since July and up from a four-year low the previous week, Bloomberg reported, citing U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. IAU is a buy above $15.20. Direxion Daily Emerging Markets 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: EDZ) If there is any good news about the broader emerging markets universe this year, particularly the BRIC quartet, is that valuations are cheap and perhaps attractive. Thanks to Cyprus it would cheap is about to turn to cheaper given the proclivity of emerging markets equities to be adversely impacted by goings on in the eurozone. As for EDZ, here is why this triple-leveraged play makes this week's list. It is the inverse equivalent of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM), an ETF with a concerning chart. If EEM drops another four percent, it should catch support at its 200-day moving average. EDZ holders will love that because that likely means a gain of 11 or 12 percent. That could happen this week. After all, EDZ jumped almost eight last week alone. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-04-15,Gold Gets Hammered Again,"Gold gets hammered Gold futures for June delivery had dropped nearly 8 percent, trading at $1380.20 on the New York Comex intraday Monday. The gold-tracking ETFs SPDR Gold Shares (NYSEGLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) were down 7.4% and 7.5%, respectively, on the day. Monday's bloodletting followed another awful day for gold investors on Friday; from Thursday's close, GLD and IAU investors were down about 11.5% as of intraday Monday. Gold is malleable -- are gold investors? One of the physical properties of gold is that it is highly malleable, so gold can get hammered (into gold leaf, for example, which is pictured nearby) without breaking. Whether gold investors will be as resilient if this steep correction continues remains to be seen, but the speed of this collapse is bound to be disconcerting for gold longs, considering that it has outpaced some of the more prominent, recent bearish outlooks on gold. For example, in a report released on April 2nd (The End Of The Gold Era?), analysts at Societe Generale (OTC: SCGLY) predicted gold could trade at $1375 per ounce by year end, with an average price of $1500 for 2013. More recently, on April 11th, analysts at Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) issued 6 month and 12 month target gold prices of $1490 and $1390, respectively. Gold has dived faster in the last two trading days than even these bearish institutional analysts anticipated. Downside Protection And Malleability As we noted in a post as gold was heading toward its peak in 2011 (Gold Goes Parabolic, Hedging Costs Rise), one of the advantages of being hedged is that it obviates the need to panic or run for the exits: If you're hedged when the next correction in gold hits, you'll have the breathing room to consider whether that correction is analogous to 1980's crash from gold's generational peak or to 2008's sharp, though temporary, correction. Remember that in 2008 gold fell to a low of $712.50 per ounce, after having peaked at over $1,011 per ounce earlier in the year. A gold investor who had been hedged could have, if he were still bullish on gold at that point, sold his hedges and used the proceeds to increase his position in gold. Malleability works as a metaphor here, since a hedged gold investor's portfolio could potentially handle getting hammered by a gold correction, more so than an unhedged portfolio. Consider, for example the hypothetical gold investor we mentioned in a post earlier this year (Two Inexpensive Ways To Hedge GLD). Hedging a gold position on January 25th In the article mentioned above, we gave examples of how a hypothetical investor with a 1000 shares of GLD could have used optimal puts* or an optimal collar** to hedge against a greater-than-10% drop between then and late June. This was the optimal put hedge: As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this put protection, as a percentage of position value, was quite inexpensive: only 0.77%. Note that, to be conservative, the cost here was calculated using the ask price of the optimal puts. In practice, an investor can often buy puts for a lower price, i.e., some price between the bid and ask. How GLD Has Performed Since We Posted That Hedge Not well. GLD has declined about 17% since, as of intra-day Monday. How Those Optimal Puts Reacted To GLD's Drop The screen capture below shows how those optimal puts we showed back in January reacted to GLD's drop as of intra-day Monday. As you can see in the screen capture above, those puts jumped more than 166% intra-day Monday when had GLD dropped 7.6% by the same time. This is an example of the nonlinearity of options, which enables a small dollar amount of options to protect a much larger position in an underlying security, such as GLD. How That Hedge Cushioned GLD's Drop GLD closed at $160.65 on January 25th. An investor who owned 1000 shares and bought the optimal puts to hedge it against a >10% drop that day had $160,650 in GLD and an outlay of $1,230 on the puts (again, assuming, conservatively, that he bought the puts at the ask). $160,650 + $1,230 = $161,880. As of intra-day Monday, GLD traded at $133.15, and those puts traded at $15.20. As of intra-day Monday, our investor's GLD shares were worth $133,150 and his put options were worth $15,200: $133,150 + $15,200 = $148,350. So, although GLD dropped about 17% from January 25th's close to intra-day Monday, April 15th, an investor who bought those puts on January 25th was only down about 8.4% on his combined hedge + underlying stock position over the same time frame. More Protection Than Promised Recall that the optimal put hedge was designed to protect against a greater-than-10% decline. Because these had time value in addition to intrinsic value as of April 12th's close, they offered more protection than that. Inexpensive To Hedge For Most Of This Year As I noted on the Index Investing Show two weeks ago (starting at about 25:28 of the recording at the link), despite its poor performance from the beginning of the year until then, it was actually less expensive to hedge GLD than it was to hedge SPY. Hedging GLD Now It's still possible to hedge GLD, but it's not as cheap to do so. The screen capture below shows the optimal puts, as of intraday Monday, to hedge 1000 shares of GLD against another, greater-than-10% drop by September 20th. As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this protection, as a percentage of position value, was 3.79% - nearly 5x as expensive as it was to hedge against the same percentage drop back in January. A Less Expensive Way Of Hedging GLD Now An investor looking to limit his downside in GLD to 10% over the next several months, but also willing to cap his potential upside by 10% over the same time frame, could have used the optimal collar** below to hedge intraday Monday. As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the net cost of this collar was 0.68% of position value. *Optimal puts are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest possible cost. Portfolio Armor uses an algorithm developed by a finance Ph.D to sort through and analyze all of the available puts for your stocks and ETFs, scanning for the optimal ones. **Optimal collars are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest net cost, while not limiting your potential upside by more than you specify. The algorithm to scan for optimal collars was developed in conjunction with a post-doctoral fellow in the financial engineering department at Princeton University. The screen captures of optimal hedges above come from the Portfolio Armor iOS app."
2013-04-15,Gold's Slide Hurting These Country ETFs,"Gold's foray deep into bear market territory Monday is claiming a predictable batch of victims, namely popular ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Of course, the miners and the relevant ETFs are getting in on the act as well. Unfortunately, gold's list of victims does not end there. The yellow metal's slide is also plaguing several country-specific ETFs tracking nations that are major gold producers. China and the U.S. are the largest and third-largest gold producers in the world, respectively, but there are reasons beyond gold's fall that explain why the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) and the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) are lower. When taking that into account and taking Ghana and Uzbekistan, both top-10 gold producing countries, out of the equation, the ETFs that track the largest gold-producing nations are still getting beaten up on Monday. Even the newly minted Global X Central Asia & Mongolia Index ETF (NYSE: AZIA), which offers exposure to several central Asian countries though not Uzbekistan, is down more than 4.7 percent. Global investors looking to dodge the calamity caused by gold should consider taking a pass on the following ETFs. iShares MSCI Australia Index Fund (NYSE: EWA) Just last week, analysts published both bearish and bullish views on Australian equities. Today, EWA, the largest ETF tracking the world's second-largest gold producer, is down 2.7 percent. That is not surprising given the EWA's 19.1 percent allocation to materials stocks, including BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP), the world's largest mining company. There is one way gold's fall could work in EWA's favor. One of the most cited reasons for being bearish on Australian stocks is the strong Australian dollar. The Aussie is a commodity currency and the commodity it is believed to have an intimate correlation to is gold. The correlation is not high as over the past five years GLD has offered better than quadruple the returns of the CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust (NYSE: FXA). Still, any relief Australian exporters can get in terms of a weaker Aussie would be viewed as a positive sign. The danger to EWA is that with gold rapidly losing its safe-haven status, the Australian dollar could rise even as gold falls as investors look for new safe-havens. The Aussie fits the bill. After all, Australia has an AAA credit rating and a three percent interest rate, which is high by developed world standards. iShares MSCI All Peru Capped Index Fund (NYSE: EPU) Although Peru is expected to be South America's fastest-growing economy this year, it was noted two months ago that EPU's materials sector exposure could be problematic. That has proven to be the case as the ETF has been hampered by its 44.1 percent weight to the materials sector. EPU faces a triple whammy in that it is not only a major gold producer, but it is the world's largest silver producer. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) is off 14 percent in just the past five days. The triple whammy is completed by Peru's status as a major copper producer. The red metal has proven far from immune to the slide in precious metals and China's disappointing first-quarter GDP report. Southern Copper (NYSE: SCCO) and Buenaventura Mines (NYSE: BVN) are EPU's second- and third-largest holdings, combing for nearly 21.3 percent of the ETF's weight. EPU is down more than 13 percent its 2013 high and a move below $39 would have the ETF joining gold in bear market territory. iShares MSCI South Africa Index Fund (NYSE: EZA) An easy call to make here as South Africa is the fifth-largest gold producer in the world, just ahead of Peru. EZA is off 3.6 percent and gold's fall is only exacerbating a bad situation for this ETF. EZA has already been plagued alarmingly high unemployment rate (over 20 percent) and the laggard performances of the largest emerging markets this year. Gold's slide has the ETF threatening support at $60 and if that area gives out, EZA could return back to the October 2011 low around $52. EZA has other problems, too. South Africa is the largest platinum producer and the second-largest palladium producer behind Russia. The ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT) and the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) are off 4.7 percent and 5.5 percent, respectively on Monday. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-04-30,Is Gold Still A Safe-Haven?,"For decades, maybe even centuries, gold was viewed as a safe-haven investment. The yellow metal was what investors leaned on during bear markets for stocks, when the dollar slumped or when inflation spiked. Not only was gold somewhat safe, but it was also rewarding to investors during an unprecedented bull market that spanned 12 years. That bull market saw gold surge from around $280 in early 2000 to above $1,900 per ounce in August 2011. That is an almost seven-fold jump, but these days, gold has lost some of its luster. On April 15, gold suffered its worst-one day performance in 30 years and now gold bears, many of whom told investors to stay away from the yellow metal when it was $600, $800 and $1,000 an ounce, are saying gold is in a new bear market. Whether investors hold gold bars, coins, trade futures or own popular ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), they need and want answers in this trying environment for precious metals. That is why Benzinga's Marketfy unit has assembled a trio of sharp minds for a webinar called Playing The Gold Market: Is It A Safe Bet? This premier opportunity, which investors can register for here, kicks off Sunday May 5th at 7pm Eastern time. On the panel will be Price Headley, founder of BigTrends.com and Danny Riley from Mr. Top Step and a futures and options trader with over three decades of experience. They will be joined by Benzinga's Chief ETF Analyst The ETF Professor. The ETF Professor, a former hedge fund trader, manages an all-ETF portfolio on Marketfy. Consider this: The SPDR Gold Shares, once the second-largest ETF in the world by assets, is down almost eight percent in just the past month. Silver has been worse as the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) has plunged over 14 percent. Put simply, investors that own or want to be involved with precious metals should not miss this webinar on Sunday May 5 at 7pm EST. This is not an entry-level get together. Sunday's webinar gives attendees access to three traders with over six decades of combined market experience. The panel for this live discussion will be covering information on gold that is pertinent to serious trader and investors. Each panelist will speak for 10 minutes and that will be followed by a 30-minute Q&A session where no gold-related topic is off limits. As a small preview, expect the ETF Professor to discuss the the failure of gold mining stocks and investors can profit from that trend. Remember this is a must-attend event for those that are even thinking about getting involved with gold. For information on Sunday's webinar, click here."
2013-05-02,Bond ETF Inflows Surge in April ,"April was another decent month for global exchange traded products inflows, though the $10.3 billion that flowed into ETFs and ETNs last month was off the pace seen in the first quarter. Still, year-to-date global ETP inflows are up to $79.9 billion, well ahead of last year's record pace of $66.3, according to BlackRock data. Perhaps in a sign that investors remain apprehensive about stocks and other risky assets, bond ETFs saw $9.5 billion in inflows last month, the best month for that category since May 2012, said BlackRock. Some investors may also be showing signs of concern regarding rising interest rates because short duration funds attracted $5.6 billion last month. BlackRock's (NYSE: BLK) iShares unit is the world's largest ETF sponsor. With gold suffering its worst one-day performance in three decades last month, outflows from ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) totaled $8.7 billion. Year-to-date outflows from gold ETFs are now $17.9 billion, according to BlackRock. Outflows from GLD mean that ETF is no longer the second-largest in the world by assets behind the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). The number two spot now belongs to the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: VWO). Surprisingly, year-to-date inflows to gold miner funds remain slightly positive. Equity-based ETFs raked in $9.6 billion last month and investors are embracing non-market cap weighted funds. Non-Market Cap weighted funds have captured 42% of Equity ETP flows YTD, more than two times their share of Equity assets. Key drivers in this category are Dividend Income with flows of $3.4bn in April - a new record monthly high - and $10.9bn YTD as well as Minimum Volatility with $2.5bn in April and $6.5bn YTD, said BlackRock. Lead by weakness in diversified ETFs, emerging markets funds saw outflows of $3.5 billion in April, but Japan remains a star at the international level as ETFs tracking the world's third-largest economy hauled in $4.8 billion last month. A total of 147 new ETPs have come to market this year, but of the 15 top asset gathers, just a third are listed in the U.S. The SPDR Blackstone / GSO Senior Loan ETF (NYSE: SRLN), which debuted on April 3, attracted $155 million last month. Two iShares ETFs, the iShares MSCI USA Size Factor ETF (NYSE: SIZE) and the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF (NYSE: MTUM), have topped $100 million in AUM in barely more than two weeks of trading.

2013-08-05,July ETF Inflows Top $44 billion,"Inflows for global exchange traded products soared to $44.1 billion last month, the best month since September 2012, when inflows reached $45.1 billion. Year-to-date inflows of $143.3 billion are now ahead of last year's record of $128.3 billion, according to data from BlackRock (NYSE: BLK), parent company of iShares, the world's largest ETF issuer. Helped by a rebound in U.S. stocks, U.S. equity ETFs attracted $31.6 billion in cash in July, more than triple the amount that went into equity mutual funds. Following outflows of $8.4 billion in June, bond ETFs raked in $6.4 billion in July, with $2.6 billion of that total going to junk bond funds. That is good for the largest amount to high-yield bond funds since February 2012, according to BlackRock. Flows into US Sector funds swelled to $6.2bn, the highest monthly total since 2008. Investors favored more economically sensitive sectors including Financials with $2.3bn, Technology with $1.2bn, and Energy with $0.6bn, said BlackRock. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF), the largest financial services ETF by assets, is the only sector fund among the top-10 asset-gathering ETFs on a year-to-date basis. Related: Regional Bank ETFs: Don't Mess With Texas. Investors continued to pull money out of ETFs backed by physical gold, such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) last month. Outflows from gold ETFs were $2.6 billion in July, bringing the two-month total to $6.9 billion, according to BlackRock data. Emerging markets ETFs, which have frustrated investors for much of 2013, saw small inflows of $500 million last month after $4.3 billion in redemptions in the previous month. However, investors did pull $1.1 billion from China ETFs in July. On a year-to-date basis, the top three ETFs in terms of inflows are the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY), the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (NYSE: DXJ) and the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSE: EWJ). US and Japanese Equity exposures account for the bulk of the year-over-year Equity flow growth. Both equity markets have been bolstered by accommodative CentralBank monetary policies, said BlackRock. Other funds on the top-10 list for 2013 inflows include the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE: IWM), XLF, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSE: VTI) and the PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio (NYSE: BKLN). Nine of the top-10 ETFs in terms of year-to-date outflows are listed in the U.S. and the list is lead by GLD with 2013 outflows of nearly $19.9 billion.

Funds with U.S. equity exposure lost $14.5 billion, but $13.8 billion of that figure was pulled from the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY), according to BlackRock data. Related: July ETF Inflows Top $44 Billion. Investors could also be positioning for increased market volatility in September. There are a number of upcoming events and announcements with implications for the global economy including the release of US Non-Farm Payroll numbers ahead of the highly anticipated next meeting of the FOMC, the German elections, meetings of other major Central Banks, US debt ceiling negotiations, and the escalating conflict in Syria, said BlackRock in its monthly ETF Landscape report. BlackRock (NYSE: BLK) is the world's largest asset manager and parent company of iShares, the world's largest ETF sponsor. BlackRock noted that talk of Federal Reserve tapering prompted outflows of $3.5 billion last month from emerging markets. U.S. and Japan-focused funds continue to lead in terms of year-to-date inflows. Year-to-date (YTD) flows are now $128.1bn, behind the previous record high of $139.9bn through August 2012. However, the 2013 composition remains much different with Equity gathering 80% more than last year, Fixed Income just a third as much and Commodity outflows adding a significant drag, said BlackRock. Despite some glimmers of hope among emerging markets ETFs,investors have pulled $11.1 billion from developing world equity funds this year year. Gold ETFs lost another $700 million last month despite impressive performances from funds such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Overall outflows from U.S.-listed ETFs were $17.5 billion last month, the largest number since early 2010, according to BlackRock data. Europe and Asia-Pacific equivalents combined for $3 billion of inflows. With the departure of $13.8 billion from SPY, the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (NYSE: DXJ) is now the top asset-gathering ETF this year with inflows of $8.44 billion. The iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSE: EWJ) and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE: IWM) are in second and third with inflows of $4.65 billion and $4.45 billion, respectively.

Among bond ETFs, the Vanguard Short-Term Bond ETF (NYSE: BSV) and the PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio (NYSE: BKLN) have proven durable amid outflows from bond funds. BSV and BKLN have brought in almost $7.9 billion in assets this year. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) is this year's top asset-gathering sector ETF with $3.86 billion worth of inflows, according to BlackRock. The worst offenders among outflows include the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) at almost $20.1 billion in lost assets this year. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: EEM) and the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE: LQD) have lost $14.3 billion combined through the end of August.

2013-09-24,How to Profit from Gold's Current Price Instability,"By John Whitefoot Gold prices hit one-week highs after the Federal Reserve did exactly what it said it would do (not what the market feared it would do)—continue it’s $85.0-billion-per-month bond buying program until unemployment numbers decrease and inflation increases. Gold, often seen as a safe haven investment and hedge against inflation, had lost more than 20% of its value since the beginning of the year after the Federal Reserve hinted it would start to taper quantitative easing, which would put an end to its loose monetary policy. More recently, gold prices had been on the decline since the beginning of September on encouraging U.S. economic data and suggestions that a war in Syria would be averted. Between September 3 and 17, gold lost approximately six percent of its value. But in spite of gold’s year-long tumble, it’s important to remember that gold prices are still roughly 60% higher than they were in late 2008, before the Federal Reserve kick-started its first round of quantitative easing. Gold was poised to fall even further had the Federal Reserve announced it would begin to taper its quantitative easing policies. It didn’t, however, and the markets responded in kind. The price of gold bullion soared 4.2% last Wednesday to around $1,367 per ounce, its largest daily gain since June 2012, after Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said it would stick to its stimulus plan (for now). The correction in gold prices was inevitable. That’s because gold, and many other sectors, have become overly reliant on the Federal Reserve’s support. Gold prices drop when investors think the Fed’s going to taper, and they rise when it doesn’t. Even the risk of war in the Middle East takes a back seat to the Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing program. While the correction in gold prices was inevitable, so too is the fact that the Federal Reserve will eventually begin to scale back quantitative easing, though probably not until early 2014. When it does, gold prices will likely resume their decline. After all, encouraging economic data will point to sustained U.S. growth—and less of a need for a low-interest-rate environment. All of this will negatively impact gold bulls. That said, investors can gain exposure to gold regardless of the fluctuations. Long-term investors looking to benefit from rising gold prices might want to consider a gold exchange-traded fund, (ETF) like SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) or iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), individual mining shares, or even physical gold. More active investors will focus on futures and options. That said, with quantitative easing on the backburner and few major political triggers out there to spark fear into the markets, short-term investors looking to make money on gold are probably going to want to take a breather. Or investors could look at ETFs that short gold, like the ProShares UltraShort Gold (NYSE: GLL) or PowerShares DB Gold Short ETN (NYSE: DGZ). They could also consider an ETF that shorts gold mining companies, like Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST). While it’s impossible to predict where gold prices will go, there is enough economic and geopolitical sentiment to make a case for going either short or long with gold. Thankfully, there are a large number of investing strategies to suit any outlook. This article How to Profit from Gold’s Current Price Instability was originally published at Daily Gains Letter"
2013-10-11,"ETFs to Play the Fall of Gold (GLD, IAU, DGZ, DZZ)","The decade-long bull market in gold began to crumble two years ago and now the metal appears to be in the early stages of a long-term bear market. Today the price of the yellow metal is falling another 2 percent as it hits a 3-month low. There are rumors the sudden drop this morning was caused by one large trade of 5k gold futures contracts. Whether the rumor proves to be true is not relevant. What is important is that the long-term and short-term trends are bearish and that investors must prepare for lower prices. The Gold ETFs The two most popular gold ETFs are the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: IAU). The ETFs are designed to track the day-to-day movement of the price of gold bullion; the shares are backed by physical gold. Each ETF is down 11 percent in the last six weeks and are also hitting a 3-month lows. If the ETFs continue the downtrend and retest the multi-year low set in late June they will have to fall another 6 percent. This may sound like a big move lower, but it may only be the start of a much deeper drop for the gold ETFs. Looking at the charts and the amount of money coming out of gold, it would not be a stretch to see the precious metal fall another 20 percent if the June low is breached. This would not happen overnight and it would not be a straight line down, however it is very possible. Inverse Gold ETNs Investors that agree with the synopsis above regarding the likelihood of a further drop in the price of gold could consider profiting from the move. There are a number of ETFs that will gain in value as the price of gold decreases and vice versa. The PowerShares DB Gold Short ETN (NYSE: DGZ) is designed to provide investors with 100 percent of the inverse of a gold futures contract. For example, since 8/27/13 DGZ is up 11.4 percent and GLD is down 10.6 percent. The returns are not always exactly the inverse, but typically they are close. The aggressive trader that likes to push the envelope could consider the PowerShares DB Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) that will seek to return 2x the movement of a gold futures contract. From 8/27/13 the ETN is up 24 percent. The leveraged ETN is only for the experienced trader that knows how to properly use the vehicle. If not used in the correct manner it could lead to major losses. Keep in mind that a long-term trend has many peaks and troughs throughout the time the trend plays out. The current downtrend in gold will have rallies in the future, but as long as the overall trend remains lower the best strategy is to not own the metal or have a short position."
2014-02-12,Two Reasons to Consider Gold Investments Right Now,"“Why would someone be bullish on gold right now? Stocks have the momentum. Let me warn: you will be better off buying stocks than buying gold bullion.” These were the “wise” words of my good old friend Mr. Speculator, when I met him over the weekend. Not too long ago, he was afraid about what would happen to his stock position. Now, his opinion has changed. Mr. Speculator thinks key stock indices will hit new highs and gold bullion—which provides safety against the backdrop of a weak economy—will go down further. He said, “It will be a bad year for gold investors.” Mr. Speculator may be right about the key stock indices. The momentum on the stock market is significantly noticeable. We see buyers come in and buy after every decline. This can continue, but you have to keep in mind that the fundamentals are becoming weak. This can be troublesome and could create a massive sell-off very quickly. Also Read: NYSE holidays 2014 On gold, however, I completely disagree. I have been bullish on gold bullion for some time, and my main argument has to do with the demand and supply of the precious metal. I see demand for gold bullion increasing, while the supply side is being threatened due to low prices. We are seeing China become the biggest consumer of gold bullion. It was India before, but the government and the central bank of the country are working very hard to curb the demand for the yellow shiny metal. According to the China Gold Association, in 2013, the total precious metal consumption in the country increased by 41% to 1,176.4 tonnes. This was the first time when Chinese demand for gold reached more than 1,000 tonnes. (Source: Standing, J. and Ananthalakshmi, A., “UPDATE 1-China’s gold demand surges, tops 1,000 tonnes for first time,” Reuters, February 10, 2014.) China isn’t the only place where we see heavy gold buying. The U.S. is a similar case. For example, until February 7, the U.S. Mint has sold 97,500 ounces of gold bullion in American Eagle coins. (Source: “Bullion Sales/Mintage Figures,” United States Mint web site, last accessed February 10, 2014.) The U.S. Mint also sold 41,500 ounces of gold bullion in American Buffalo 24-karat coins. This was the second-highest amount of gold bullion sold in American Buffalo 24-karat coins since January of 2013. (Source: Ibid.) Back in April of 2013 and then in June, when gold bullion prices witnessed selling pressures, the general consensus by the bears was that the buyers will eventually run out. This hasn’t happened; in fact, we are actually seeing an increasing number of buyers. At the end of the day, gold bullion isn’t a bad investment at all. It provides safety in times of uncertainty; we see risks in the global economy increasing, plus the fundamentals that drive the key stock indices aren’t as surprising. The argument to own gold bullion gets even better when the demand and supply situations become promising. For those investors who agree with this position that gold bullion should be a part of their portfolio, you may want to look at exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). This ETF provides investors with exposure to gold bullion, and it’s a cheaper alternative to the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) ETF.

2014-02-25,Where to Invest When Key Stock Indices Struggle to Climb Higher,"Key stock indices were going through a rough patch from the beginning of the year until early February. Now, they seem to have some momentum to the upside. With this, investors are asking what kind of upside potential is possible. Will the key stock indices continue to increase and break above their previous highs, or are we due for another sell-off like the one we saw earlier, and only then will we see some good buying points? Let me begin by saying what I have said many times in these pages before: 2013 was a stellar year for key stock indices, but now they need to breathe a little. The key stock indices may go above their all-time highs made at the end of last year, but the move isn’t going to be as robust. You might see a slow, dreadful move to the upside. If this scenario does play out—key stock indices moving slowly and breaking above their all-time highs—the fundamentals are suggesting it won’t be a significant move. Also Read: NYSE holidays 2014 Companies on the key stock indices are warning about their corporate earnings. For example, 66 companies on the S&P 500 have issued negative guidance about their corporate earnings in the first quarter of this year. (Source: “Slightly larger cuts to earnings estimates than average at mid-point of Q1 2014,” FactSet, February 14, 2014.) Corporate earnings estimates by analysts are also being slashed. Mind you, we are just in the second month of the quarter. Major names on the key stock indices are reporting horrible sales. Consider Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), a major industrial goods manufacturer, for example. The company reported its revenues declined 16% in 2013. Its profits declined from $8.48 per share in 2012 to $5.75 per share in 2013. Going forward, Caterpillar isn’t very optimistic. The company said, “We expect sales and revenues in 2014 to be similar to 2013—about $56 billion in a range of plus or minus 5 percent.” (Source: “4Q 2013 Earnings Release,” Caterpillar Inc, January 27, 2014.) Don’t forget: corporate earnings, at the very core, are the most basic factor for a rise in key stock indices. When looking from a technical analysis point of view, the key stock indices show there’s a struggle and investors aren’t as excited. Please look at the chart below of the S&P 500. Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com After the S&P 500 dropped in the beginning of the year, it recovered in a classic “V” formation, which showed momentum, but there was something interesting happening at the same time: we saw volume decline quickly, while the indicators that suggest strength and momentum (red circled area in the chart above) show the bulls are losing steam. In times like these, long-term investors should resort to investments that can provide them with safety, especially in case there’s a sell-off, as these types of investments will protect their portfolio from being affected all that much. These investors may consider looking at exchange-traded funds (ETFs), like iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) for safety, or iShares MSCI USA Quality Factor (NYSE: QUAL). The latter ETF holds big-cap companies, which tend to show more stability in times of uncertainty.

2014-02-26,Why I'm Even More Bullish on Gold Bullion Now,"Since the beginning of the year, one asset class has shone when compared to the stock market. I am talking about gold bullion. The yellow shiny metal’s prices are up more than 10%. The stock market, on the other hand, hasn’t performed as well. For example, year-to-date, the S&P 500 is only up by little more than one percent. With this said, I believe gold bullion can surprise investors even more this year. Let me explain why… Also Read: NYSE holidays 2014 Looking from a technical analysis point of view, there are a few interesting developments that suggest gold bullion prices are heading higher. Remember the first rule of technical analysis: the trend is your friend, until it’s broken. With this in mind, please look at the chart below. Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com The downtrend that gold bullion prices were following since late 2012 has now been broken (black line). At the same time, we see prices breaking above the 200-day moving average for the first time since early 2013 and sustaining above the 50-day moving average. This suggests sentiment is turning bullish. In addition to this, we see indicators of momentum, like the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), suggest bulls are in control (as indicated by the black line below the chart). The fundamentals of gold bullion prices are suggesting investors are going to reap rewards as well. The demand continues to increase and the supply remains subdued. This is the perfect recipe for higher prices. In 2013, we saw central banks buy gold bullion; they have been net buyers of gold bullion since 2009. It will not be a surprise to see them buy even more gold bullion, considering currencies in the global economy are showing wild movements. On top of consumer demand—which we are seeing from China, India, and other countries—central banks buying the yellow metal just creates more pressure on the supply side. Last year, gold bullion prices fell victim to irrational selling; 2013 was not the year for those who bought gold-related investments. The sell-off that took place last year took out the speculators, and we are now starting to see some real buying. I don’t exactly know where gold bullion prices will go—it’s very difficult to place a specific target. I don’t think anyone can tell this. But looking at all the fundamentals and the technicals, I can’t help but be more bullish than I was before. Investors who are looking to profit from gold bullion prices have to look at their risk tolerance before making any buying decisions. Investors have to keep in mind that in the world of finance, a lot can change in a matter of days, so the riskier your bets are, the bigger the loss or profit is going to be. Investors with a low tolerance for risk may want to look at exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). For those investors who are looking for leveraged returns, they may look at ETFs like Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). For those who are willing to take on extraordinary risk, you might consider looking at ETFs like Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shrs (NYSE: NUGT).

2014-10-13,"S&P 500, Homebuilders And Gold ETFs To Watch This Week","Investors continue to question where the bottom of this most recent dip in stocks will materialize. The markets closed on Friday near the same levels that led to a bounce in early August, however, many fear that a deeper correction may be in the works. The week ahead features the release of September retail sales statistics, housing data, and industrial metrics. In addition, markets will be paying close attention to a high profile round of earnings announcements from Bank of America Corp and Google Inc. Here are the key ETFs to watch for the week of Monday, October 13: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) Late day selling on Friday led to the S&P 500 Index landing just above its 200-day moving average. This long-term trend line hasn’t been breached since late-2012, when prices dipped slightly below and then rocketed higher. Related Link: Best And Worst ETFs Of The Week Amid Crude Oil Collapse Traders will be closely watching the price action in and around these levels to see if sellers have exhausted their downward momentum. SPY and other ETFs that track the S&P 500 Index are likely going to see a high volume and interest over the next week. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE: XHB) Companies engaged in the homebuilding and supportive industries have endured a rough 2014, with XHB having fallen nearly 14 percent. On Friday, this index dropped to its lowest level of the year. XHB appears to be set for further declines unless upbeat housing data leads to a turnaround. Data releases this week will impact this ETF. On Thursday and Friday the latest numbers on housing starts and home builders’ confidence will be released. In addition, many of the companies that make up this index will likely be impacted by retail sales data as well. Better than expected readings may help prop up this ailing sector during the remainder of 2014. iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) Gold prices have been sliding for the last two months and recently found support near their prior 2013 lows. The volatility in stocks may have been partially responsible for money coming back into gold-related ETFs as a hedge against further deterioration in the economy. IAU has been positive for each of the last five trading sessions and will look to build on this recent upside momentum in the week ahead. Keep an eye on this ETF and other precious metals funds that have fallen to deep value levels and may be due for a more significant bounce."
2014-12-30,Gold Looking To Break Out,"Gold futures were trading higher by 1.3 percent Tuesday morning on the back of a weaker U.S. Dollar and weakness in equity prices. February Gold futures were last trading at $1198, approaching the key psychological and technical $1200 level. After briefly breaking above $1200 in early December, only to falter, February Gold has made seven subsequent attempts to break above the $1200 resistance, only to fail each time. With the year-end producer selling mostly completed, it will be interesting to see if gold, down 1.5 percent year-to-date, can finally make a meaningful upside breakout. If gold does break out, $1225 would be the next meaningful resistance level. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (NYSE: IAU) were up more than 1 percent in the premarket."
2014-12-30,Why Brian Kelly Is Betting On Gold For 2015,"Brian Kelly is long the gold miners. He’s the founder and managing member of Brian Kelly Capital, and he recently joined Benzinga’s #PreMarket Prep to talk about why he thinks 2015 could be a big year for gold. Kelly said he’s thought this for a while now, but there are multiple factors that could make it come to fruition in the upcoming year. “One, if the economy does get much stronger, at some point in time, you may get somewhat of an inflation plan there,” he said, but noted that it looks like the economy is seeing more deflation, if anything. Related Link: Why Dennis Gartman Says Oil Will Go 'Demonstrably Lower' More importantly, Kelly explained that the central bank-buying and physical buying of gold, which he said is happening in Asia, did happen in Russia and could potentially happen in Europe. “That, to me, is the big factor in the gold market of 2015: that physical buying,” he said. There’s a disconnect between physical buying and the gold ETFs, the paper gold, Kelly went on, which is why he liked the gold miners better. He’s long the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). He likes those because that’s how an investor purchases gold without actually taking possession of the bar, itself. Kelly expects the miners to outperform on the upside in the coming year. For example, if gold is up 1 percent, he said investors can expect to see miners up 2 to 3 percent. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) both traded about 1 percent higher in Tuesday's session, while GDX traded up more than 4 percent. Kelly also talked about crude oil and the U.S. dollar.

2015-03-24,Gold To Reach $1300 Soon? This Analyst Thinks So,"Gold has bounced back significantly after making lows of nearly $1,150 on March 17, rising five days consecutively. MacNeil Curry, analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, feels this is only the start, and gold can target levels above $1,300. Curry was on CNBC Tuesday to explain why he is bullish on gold right now. Rally Drivers First and foremost we have seen a pretty decent break, so when you say rates are headed lower and the dollar is likely to remain in a correcting sequence in general, gold should rally in that environment and price action says that, Curry said. Related Link: The Way Gold Prices Are Calculated Just Changed Forever We have really, since November of last year, been in a pretty sizeable corrective phase. Within that corrective phase, we are looking for a move back up to the highs of $1307, but also remember, gold has been on its own really since November of last year. He continued, If you go back and look, gold made its lows back in November. It went from $1,132 up to $1,307. And throughout that time, the dollar index actually rose from about 87.5 to almost 95. So, I think the big thing here is that we are going to see continued breakdown in the correlation, negative correlation, between gold and the dollar over the course of next couple of weeks. And if you look at the price actions, it says gold should probably resume higher. Levels To Watch Curry was asked the important numbers that investors should look at between where gold is trading now to his target of above $1,300. He replied, I think first and foremost the 200-day moving average at about $1,238 has been a bit of a pivot. And then on the downside, the big support is the March 17 low at $1,152. We shouldn't trade back below there, Curry concluded."
2015-07-27,A Look Ahead: Biotech And Energy ETFs To Watch This Week,"Last week was one to forget for U.S. stocks and select exchange traded funds, as high-beta energy and materials stocks continued to be laggards while slack earnings reports from some previous high-flying names weighed on broader benchmarks. The S&P 500 lost 1.1 percent last week, the worst weekly showing by the benchmark U.S. index in four months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its worst weekly performance since January. Biotech To this point, nearly 190 (or just under 40 percent) of S&P 500 members have reported earnings and this week is another busy one on the earnings front. Biotechnology ETFs, among this year’s top-performing sector funds, suffered a blow last Friday, when Biogen Inc (NASDAQ: BIIB) pared 2015 after it reported disappointing results for an experimental drug to treat Alzheimer’s disease. Shares of Biogen plunged 22 percent last Friday and would need to climb 60 percent to reclaim the 52-week high. iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), the largest biotech ETF, will again be put to the earnings test this week as Amgen and Gilead Sciences step into earnings confessional. Amgen and Gilead combine for almost 15.4 percent of IBB’s weight. Related Link: Best And Worst ETFs Of The Week Amid Consumer Discretionary Strength Energy Speaking of big-name sector ETFs that will be front-and-center earnings plays this week, look no further than the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE). Over the course of the week, investors will be treated to earnings reports from Anadarko Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Occidental Petroleum and Williams Cos. XLE’s earnings parade gets more significant on Friday when Dow components Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two largest U.S. oil companies, report. The aforementioned energy stocks combine for over 39 percent of XLE’s weight. Chevron’s earnings update could be particularly important because the company has yet to announce a dividend increase this year, potentially jeopardizing a payout increase streak that spans 27 years. Emerging Market ETFs For the week ended July 22, investors pulled $3.3 billion from emerging markets ETFs and of the almost 150 ETFs that hit 52-week lows last Friday, 26 were emerging markets funds. Of those 26, five were Brazil ETFs and four others were Latin America funds. That could be a sign a laggard region has more downside ahead. The iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (NYSE: EWZ) is off 14 percent over the past month and currently resides at its lowest levels since early 2009. Investors have pulled nearly $764 million from EWZ this year. On the note of problematic ETFs, there are gold funds. Data revealed last week show professional traders are net short gold for the first time since such data started being collected in 2006. Last Friday, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) were two of the 10 worst ETFs for outflows. With gold miners ETFs densely populating the all-time and 52-week low lists, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST) and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: JDST) merit consideration for the risk-tolerant trader. After all, DUST and JDST are up an average of 90 percent over the past month."
2015-08-19,"Highlights From The FOMC Minutes; Yields & U.S. Dollar Fall, Gold Rises","U.S. Treasury bonds for both the short- and long-term and the U.S. dollar were falling on Wednesday, while gold prices were rising after the Federal Open Market Committee minutes were leaked. Many important issues were discussed in the meeting. Here's a look at some of the key points. The Committee reported on the developments and state of domestic and foreign financial markets; plans for examinations of the Term Deposit Facility in August and of term RRPs at the end of the third quarter of the year; and “recent steps the System had taken to prepare further for the process of normalization of monetary policy” among other subjects relevant to the economy. Most Fed officials noted rate hike conditions were “approaching,” although the labor market still has room for improvement and they would like to see a more achievable inflation outlook and additional markets data. However, one official said he/she would hike rates already, but was willing to wait for more evidence, as the others had agreed on. The staff highlighted “the risks to the forecast for real GDP and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside,” reflecting their assessment that neither fiscal nor monetary policy seemed to be able to help the economy endure considerable adverse shocks. “At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced. Regarding the timing and pace of policy normalization, officials said a “premature policy tightening” could have limited ability “to offset downside shocks to inflation and economic activity when the federal funds rate was near its effective lower bound.” Most members assured the labor market slack could be mostly eliminated in the near-term, leading to conditions “as at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment (…) However, several were concerned that labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment could take longer to achieve, noting, for example, the lack of convincing signs of accelerating wages, which might be signaling that the natural rate of unemployment could currently be lower than they previously thought.” Participants generally noticed consumer spending was recuperating, and said they expected it to surge moderately over the short-term. They also assured to still be expecting “that the downward pressure on inflation from the previous declines in energy prices and the effects of past dollar appreciation would prove to be temporary.” Shares of the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), ProShares Ultra Gold (ETF) (NYSE: UGL), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (NYSE: IAU) were trading up on Wednesday afternoon."

2015-09-08,Will Precious Metals Ever Sparkle Again?,"A month that saw stocks fall by their largest percentage in nearly five years has coincided with the price of gold jumping nearly 8 percent before falling off as markets stabilized toward the end of last week. SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (NYSE: IAU) and other gold-related ETFs have fallen as well. Since the yellow metal had spent most of 2015 selling off, the question for investors is whether gold’s recent advance has any more life in it. Amid the recent volatility in equities, many gold and precious metal stocks have outperformed. The Precious Metals motif gained 4.8 percent in the past month. In that same time, the Standard & Poor’s 500 lost 5.8 percent. So far in 2015, the motif has lost 49.6 percent; the S&P 500 is down 3.8 percent. In the past, investor interest in gold has increased with uncertainty over monetary policy that might influence the value of the dollar. Whether that pattern will continue remains to be seen amid recent shifts in analyst consensus estimates about the timing of the interest rate increase by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Remarks by Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer over the weekend created the impression the central bank would stick to its plan to raise rates before the end of the year despite the recent pronounced swings in global markets. While analysts at RBC Capital Markets recently decreased their long-term target for gold prices, they do see possible improvement over the near and long term. The former appears driven by seasonal demand from India and latter by fundamental demand out of China and emerging market countries, as well as steady central bank buying. In a recent report, RBC Capital said it saw seasonal gold demand picking up into the Indian wedding and festival season—the focus of which should be around the festival of Diwali in November. Chinese demand should also pick up in early 2016 ahead of the country’s new year, on February 8, according to RBC’s report. In addition, RBC said that “a deferral of the expected September Fed rate hike or an increase in systemic risk due to: 1. A resurgence of the Greek economic risk within the Eurozone through or 2. Further Chinese devaluation of the [Yuan] could also improve sentiment and result in a firmer gold price.” And with inflation expectations (or the lack thereof) discounted into lower oil prices, if oil starts were to approach $70 or $80 a barrel over the next 12 months, the resulting pick-up in inflation expectations and headline inflation could also lift gold demand as an “inflation hedge,” RBC said. If the above scenario were to take place (and barring significant offsetting headwinds), RBC estimates gold might approach $1,300 in late 2015 or early 2016. With the metal currently around $1,130, a 15 percent near-term jump could prove beneficial for investors in gold stocks. Investments in commodity-related products, such as precious metals, agricultural products, and oil may be subject to greater volatility and liquidity risks than investments in traditional securities. Commodity-related products can be significantly impacted by underlying commodity prices, world events, government regulations, and economic conditions, which can dramatically affect the value of an investment."
2016-03-23,Here's Why Gold ETFs Are Hot,"Investors have heard plenty about gold and the relevant exchange traded funds this year and with good reason. Good reason being the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) and the ETFS Swiss Physical Gold Shares (NYSE: SGOL) are each sporting year-to-date gains of just under 18 percent. A variety of reasons have been cited as catalysts for the 2016 bullion bounce. Negative interest throughout the developed world and the Federal Reserve appearing as though it will not be able to raise U.S. borrowing costs by as much as previously thought are chief among those reasons. Things are going for well for gold and gold ETFs that GLD is this year's top asset-gathering ETF and iShares, temporarily, had to limit creations of IAU. The $6.04 billion added by GLD is more than double the inflows accrued by the second-best asset-gathering ETF. Obviously, gold ETFs are loving low and negative interest rates. Related Link: Bullion And Gold ETFs Get A Boost From The Federal Reserve Outside of the US, the yield picture is even worse. Five-year nominal yields in Japan are negative 1.6%, which means that investors are actually paying the government when they purchase Japanese government bonds. The picture is not much better in Europe and helps to explain why gold’s zero yield is no longer a barrier to entry for investors, said State Street Vice President David Mazza in a recent note. Gold often falls out of favor when investors chase stocks when stocks are hot, but popular equity-based broad market ETFs are dithering this year. Obviously, GLD up almost 18 percent looks a lot better than the 0.9 percent returned by S&P 500 funds. For gold bugs, there is nothing wrong with safe-haven demand and 2016's market action is, to this pointing, reminding investors of gold's utility. In fact, gold has proven its mettle during market crises ranging from the Soviet sovereign debt crisis to the Long Term Capital Management meltdown to the global financial crisis. Further boosting the case for gold is weak earnings growth in the U.S. Earnings-per-share (EPS) growth for US companies in the years following the financial crisis was on an upswing, boosting equity market returns. In recent months, we have seen EPS growth head into negative territory as a strong US dollar and weak global demand hinder corporations’ ability to drive margins, adds Mazza.

2016-05-16,Are Central Bankers To Thank For The Surge In Gold Prices?,"Several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold gold have surged by a quarter in recent memory. The reason for the rise in gold prices? Central banks — at least according to a report by Bloomberg. Bloomberg noted that gold has been 2016's best performing major metal after silver due to rising concerns over negative interest rates in Europe and Japan, and ongoing uncertainty surrounding a U.S. Federal Reserve tightening of its rates. Related Link: Gold Pops And Drops Firstly, the negative interest rate environment and quantitative-easing policies are reducing the pool of suitable investment options, and making gold less costly to hold, Bernard Aw, a strategist at IG Asia Pte told Bloomberg. Second, lingering fears of competitive currency devaluations and potentially fresh bouts of market volatility encourage safe-haven demand. Aw also noted that even if the Fed raises its interest rates, the prevailing rates will still remain very low. Meanwhile, billionaire investor Paul Singer suggested that the rally in gold has just begun. The manager of Elliott Management told his clients last month that if investors' confidence in central banks across the world continues to weaken, then the effect on gold could be very powerful. Finally, central banks and governments across the world are large buyers of gold. Bloomberg cited a report from the World Gold Council, which suggests that nations could buy up to 600 tones of gold this year, compared with 566.3 tons last year."
2016-05-18,Go-Go Days For Gold ETFs,"The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (NYSE: IAU) are each up more than 20 percent this year. Not only that, but the two gold exchange-traded funds are raking in new assets at a fevered pace. Gold's Golden Promises GLD, the world's largest gold ETF, has seen $8.1 billion of inflows this year, while investors have poured $1.7 billion into IAU. The aforementioned return and flows data would usually be enough to have many market observers waxing bearish on bullion. To be sure, there are plenty doing just that, but gold does not lack for supporters, either. Related Link: Are Central Bankers To Thank For The Surge In Gold Prices? Last month, the Federal Reserve opted against boosting interest rates, leaving many market participants feeling that the odds of the central bank raising borrowing costs four times this year, as many thought would be the case heading into 2016, are rapidly dwindling. The Fed's reluctance to boost borrowing costs to this point in 2016 is applying pressure to the dollar, sending the U.S. Dollar Index lower by almost 4.6 percent. That is good for dollar-denominated gold, as the easy money policies are enacted by a host of developed world central banks beyond the Fed. Does An 'Ideal' Gold Environment Even Exist? “Some environments have been more kind to gold than others. As gold pays no interest or dividend, the opportunity cost of holding the precious metal is a critical driver of returns. During periods of low or negative real rates, when the opportunity cost is low, gold has generally performed better than in periods when real rates are higher,” said Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation for BlackRock’s Global Allocation Fund, in a recent note. Gold often falls out of favor when investors chase stocks when stocks are hot, but popular equity-based broad market ETFs are dithering this year. Related Link: China Is Buying One Of London's Largest Gold Vaults For gold bugs, there is nothing wrong with safe-haven demand and 2016's market action is, to this pointing, reminding investors of gold's utility. In fact, gold has proven its mettle during market crises ranging from the Soviet sovereign debt crisis to the Long Term Capital Management meltdown to the global financial crisis. “Given slow growth, a cautious Federal Reserve and the proliferation of negative sovereign yields in Japan and Europe, U.S. real rates are likely to remain low for the foreseeable future. At the same time, both core inflation and wages have been firming while the inflation drag from last year’s strong dollar and collapse in oil is beginning to fade. This is exactly the type of environment that has historically been most favorable to gold,” added Koesterich. Disclosure: Todd Shriber owns shares of IAU."

2016-07-13,'The Sky Is The Limit' For Gold And Silver,"The markets are climbing to new heights, and commodities are hanging on for the ride. Gold and silver futures are have soared over the past year. Brexit included, KODEX Gold Futures(H) (KRX: 132030) are trading up a little over 4 percent over the past month, whereas KODEX Silver Futures(H) (KRX: 144600) are trading up around 17 percent over the past month. Furthermore, other gold and silver stocks and ETFs are likewise experiencing an upward trend: SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) is up more than 4 percent over the last month. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): Up over 17 percent. iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (NYSE: IAU): Up over 4 percent. iShares Silver Trust (ETF) (NYSE: SLV): Up over 16 percent. ProShares Ultra Silver (ETF) (NYSE: AGQ): Up over 34 percent. Silver Trust (NYSE: SIVR): Up over 16 percent. Abraham Trading Company's Salem Abraham joined Wednesday's PreMarket Prep to give his bullish outlook for the gold and silver markets. Abraham noted that gold and silver are two things on which his company is most confident. Gold and silver are our most exciting positions. We've been long gold and silver for a couple months now, and as they've flowed back and forth but they continue to run up this year, he said. We think with the strength they've shown what you find is a market that can defy gravity. Related Link: Glistening Gold: JPMorgan Upgrades Harmony Gold, Gold Fields; Downgrades DRDGOLD Abraham added that his models have been quite bullish on the two commodities as well. We have models from one-week outlook out to up to four months, and what's interesting to me as a technical trader is that all those (models) agree to gold and silver, and that's pretty rare, he said. From a technical perspective you have a lot of opinions that say, ‘Hey these markets are going higher.' Abraham further commented that gold and silver may be the safest plays in an increasingly risky market. I think in a market environment where there's a global pushback it seems like, prudent fiscal policies across the globe from a political standpoint, there's a lot of uncertainty, he said. When you've got a currency that basically interest rates are so low to negative — which is crazy — it's as crazy as it gets for paper money. I think that's the real attraction of gold and silver right now. Major markets are soaring, and Salem Abraham has a very positive position on where gold and futures are headed in the future. The sky's the limit for markets like that. For more trading ideas and insight on the markets check out PreMarket Prep LIVE every morning from 8-9:30 a.m. ET here.

2016-08-01,This Pro Is Warning Investors To Take Off Their 'Beer Goggles',"Peter Boockvar, The Lindsey Group's chief market analyst and a CNBC contributor, has a cautious view on the U.S. market. Speaking as a guest on CNBC's Squawk Box segment on Monday, Boockvar went as far as to say that the current market is a very dangerous place for investors as easy money from central banks have artificially inflated asset prices. I used the word 'beer goggles' — that QE and low rates clouded investor attitudes towards asset prices and everything looked good, he said. Boockvar continued that since the Brexit vote in late June that has been a voracious search for yield. Meanwhile, the voting outcome may have also made investors forget the risks of capital loss only for the reward of a yield that is pretty microscopic. Related Link: New Gold Reaches Analyst Target Price What Should Investors Do? Investing in U.S. equities is out of the question, according to Boockvar. In fact, the U.S. stock market is the most expensive equity market in the world. He added that investors can take advantage of better opportunities in emerging markets that have been gone through a bear market over the past four to five years. Finally, Boockvar said he is a big fan of gold and silver. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

2016-08-11,Gold ETF Fever: Investors Have It,"U.S. equities reside near all-time lows. Treasury yields rest near historic lows and the Federal Reserve has yet to raise interest rates this year. In other words, 2016 has been a pretty year for equities and fixed income exchange traded funds, but gold ETFs are thrashing both of those asset classes. Year-to-date, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest bullion-backed exchange traded product, is higher by 26.7 percent. That is nearly double the combined year-to-date returns of an S&P 500 tracking ETF and the largest bond ETF. Gold ETFs such as GLD and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) don't pay dividends and there is no yield as there is on a bond fund, meaning capital appreciation is the only way investors in these products are compensated for taking on gold market risk. With the dollar weak and trillions of dollars (and rising) worth of negative-yielding sovereign debt throughout the developed world, a perfect storm for gold has been brewing for gold this year. Data suggest investors are taking note. “With global interest rates remaining low and macroeconomic concerns staying high following the Brexit vote, investors sought out gold-related investments in the first seven months of 2016. A variety of exchange traded funds that directly invest in the commodity, as well as mining companies that are highly exposed to gold prices, have been a major beneficiary,” said S&P Capital IQ in a note out Wednesday. As the research firm notes, GLD ended July with $41 billion in assets under management after packing on $13 billion in new assets through the first seven months of the year. Year-to-date, investors have added $13.1 billion to GLD, or $4.5 billion more than the second-best ETF on an asset-gathering basis has taken in. IAU and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) have added $2.69 billion and $609.1 million, respectively, in new assets. One reason the S&P 500 is lagging gold by such a substantial margin this year is gold miners, or lack thereof in the benchmark U.S. equity index. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is up a staggering 128.1 percent year-to-date. However, only 17 percent of GDX's holdings are U.S. companies, meaning 83 percent of the ETF's members cannot be included in the S&P 500. “Matt Miller, S&P Global Market Intelligence equity analyst, thinks one important reason for equities outperforming the bullion is the high levels of operating (and in some cases financial) leverage for gold miners. Miller also notes expanding margins and strong free cash flow, which have been a result of declining All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC), a standardized measure of cost reporting that estimates the full-cycle costs to produce and sell an ounce of gold,” said S&P Capital IQ.

2016-09-12,Gold ETFs Are Still A Smart Volatility Hedge,"Gold is not bereft of volatility, but the yellow metal is often thought as a hedge against equity market turbulence. Treasury yields rest near historic lows and the Federal Reserve has yet to raise interest rates this year. In other words, 2016 has been a pretty year for equities and fixed income exchange-traded funds, but gold ETFs are topping both stocks and bonds. For example, the iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (NYSE: IAU) is higher by 25.2 percent year-to-date compared to a 5.7 percent gain for the S&P 500. However, underscoring the point that gold is in fact volatile, IAU has been 320 basis points more volatile than the S&P 500 this year. Volatility, Gold And The Fed Much of this year's gold volatility can be attributed to investors' knee-jerk reactions to Federal Reserve commentary on interest rates. For example, IAU and rival gold ETFs tumbled last Friday after one Fed member said the central bank should not wait too long before raising rates. Related Link: Gold ETF Fever: Investors Have It Gold is more attractive when interest rates because there is no yield as there is on a bond fund, meaning capital appreciation is the only way investors in these products are compensated for taking on gold market risk. With the dollar weak and trillions of dollars (and rising) worth of negative-yielding sovereign debt throughout the developed world, a perfect storm for gold has been brewing for gold this year. Data suggest investors are taking note. What's In Store Later This Year? “While investors appear more convinced that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will indeed hike rates later this year, real yields remain well below where they started the year and even further below their long-term average. In other words, monetary conditions continue to be incredibly loose and supportive of gold,” according to a recent BlackRock note. Further boosting the case for gold is weak earnings growth in the United States and low and negative yields on sovereign debt throughout the developed world. Historical data confirm that over the last 45 years, gold performs well when the dollar languishes, is solid when the dollar is flat and loses ground when the greenback gains momentum. Still, gold has some merit as a hedge on equity market volatility. “In months when volatility rose, gold outperformed the S&P 500 price return by roughly 2 percent on average. And it is worth highlighting the reliability of the relationship: In months when the VIX was higher, gold outperformed 62 percent of the time. In contrast, when the VIX fell, gold beat the S&P 500 only 35 percent of the time,” added BlackRock. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

2016-11-11,Gold ETFs Can Can Still Regain Their Luster,"Investors betting that gold and exchange traded funds such as the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) would rally in the wake of Republican Donald Trump's shocking victory in Tuesday's presidential election have been disappointed. Although it has been just two trading sessions since Tuesday, IAU and rival gold ETFs have struggled. This is happening despite the fact it appears unlikely the Federal Reserve will move forward with a December interest rate hike as previously expected. Gold benefits from lower interest rates because, as an asset with no yield, the yellow metal loses allure as bond yields climb. Volatile Metal Much of this year's gold volatility can be attributed to investors' knee-jerk reactions to Federal Reserve commentary on interest rates. For example, IAU and rival gold ETFs tumbled last Friday after one Fed member said the central bank should not wait too long before raising rates. Gold is more attractive when interest rates because there is no yield as there is on a bond fund, meaning capital appreciation is the only way investors in these products are compensated for taking on gold market risk. With the dollar weak and trillions of dollars (and rising) worth of negative-yielding sovereign debt throughout the developed world, a perfect storm for gold has been brewing this year. Bull Case Not Dead A Trump victory was supposed to add to gold's ebullience, but that hasn't been the case. Not yet at least, but that doesn't mean the bull case for bullion is dead. Rising inflation could be another boon for gold and inflows to Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS) and related ETFs suggest investors are concerned about inflation. “Based on the 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) market, inflation expectations recently hit 1.75%, the highest level since the summer of 2015. To the extent that rates are being driven by changing perceptions of inflation and not real rates, higher interest rates may not be an impediment for gold,” according to a recent BlackRock note. Accounting for inflation, real U.S. interest are in negative territory, further increasing the potential for out-performance by gold relative to other safe-haven assets. “Can inflation expectations continue to rise? Probably. Despite the sharp rise in inflation expectations, 10-year breakevens (the difference between the yield on a nominal fixed-rate bond and the real yield on TIPS) remain depressed relative to their long-term history. As recently as two years ago, inflation expectations were roughly 2.25%,” adds BlackRock. Disclosure: The author owns shares of IAU."
2017-04-20,"Erratic Trump Prompts Investors To Seek Safety In Silver, Gold","Precious metals were the best-performing commodities of the first quarter, and some analysts believe the volatile nature of President Donald Trump’s first months in office played a big part. A composite of the active month futures prices of the four exchange-traded precious metals moved higher by an average of 11.45 percent in the first quarter. “Love him or hate him, there's one thing that President Donald Trump has done since he took over the White House, and that's create a lot more uncertainty around the world,” wrote stock picker Michael Lombardi in “The Lombardi Letter.” “And this is great for precious metal prices.” Lombardi cited Trump’s bombings of Syria and Afghanistan and his rhetoric about sending an aircraft carrier fleet toward North Korea — something the Pentagon later recanted — as reasons why investors were seeking out the traditional, post-apocalyptic safe havens of gold and silver. “Since the U.S. (fired) Tomahawk missiles on Syria, gold prices have made an almost-vertical move to the upside,” he said. Scary Silver Lining Silver was up more than 13 percent year-to-date, and not just as a sanctuary move. Lombardi said each Tomahawk missile contains 15 kilograms of silver wires and batteries, meaning that the 59 fired on Syria contained 31,200 ounces of the metal. “Yes, silver is a precious metal that investors often flock to (alongside gold) in times of uncertainty,” he said. “But silver is also used in the aerospace and defense sectors, so a lot more silver could be needed if the U.S. goes to war again.” Benchmark New York gold futures edged up to a five-month high on Tuesday and closed at $1,291.7 per troy ounce, the Nikkei Asian Review said. Metals Bump Began With Breixit Market analyst Itsuo Toshima told the review that the demand for gold was robust even before the geopolitical tensions of recent weeks. From Brexit to the Trump administration, a series of unexpected events across the world have been pushing up gold demand among investment funds, he said. Silver was trading at $18.13 an ounce after hitting a three-month high of $18.60 on Monday, according the APMEX metals index. Palladium was at $797.80 after reaching its three-month high of $812.50 on March 24. Gold was $1,290.70 after posting its three-month $1,294.90 on Tuesday. Platinum, a scarcer metal that historically outperforms gold, was at $980 an ounce on Thursday.

2017-07-31,Is Now The Time To Buy Gold?,"There are several ongoing stories across multiple investment classes, including stocks trading near their all-time highs, oil is trading above $50 per barrel, and the U.S. dollar continues to struggle. Meanwhile, gold is on pace for its best monthly performance since February, which may be confusing as the commodity is viewed by many as a safe-haven investment when other asset classes are struggling. Gold Is The New Gold The rise of many cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, were considered to be the new gold — that is an alternative investment that offers some form of safety from stocks, but this conception is now over, Max Wolff, a market strategist at 55 Institutional said during a recent CNBC Trading Nation segment. Investors are rising up to the reality that cryptocurrencies are prone to large sell-offs and are returning to the original safe haven tool — the yellow metal. I think risk is rising, and I think the sort of risk-free double down on risk assets period is probably over, Wolff added. Gold As An Anti-Dollar Play The U.S. dollar continues to weaken, which by default makes gold stronger, Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management added to the discussion. Looking forward, if there is any kind of negative data set relating to the U.S. economy or any positive data set from the Federal Reserve in terms of raising rates, then gold will deflate just as it has over the past few years. But this doesn't mean that now is the time to jump in and buy gold, he continued. There is still certainty if there will be a rally in the dollar moving forward or if the weak trend still has steam left. At the end of the day, gold is an anti-dollar trade than anything else and not so much as a risk trade. Related Links: Gold Stocks On The Move Traders Bet On Gold Miner Rally"
2017-08-30,Gold ETFs Could Glitter In September,"The eighth month of the year is living up to its reputation for being tricky for stocks. Barring some significant action, the S&P 500 will likely close August with the first negative performance on a monthly basis this year for the benchmark U.S. equity index. Perhaps not surprisingly, gold exchange traded funds are faring well against the backdrop of modest equity weakness. Month-to-date, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) are up 3 percent apiece. More gains could be in store for gold and bullion ETFs in September, a historically glum month for the S&P 500. “Looking forward to September, the level of uncertainty is expected to intensify amid uncertain policy direction, a volatile Trump administration, the looming debt ceiling and budget debate, in addition to the concerns that drove August” said CFRA Research Director of ETF & Mutual Fund Research Todd Rosenbluth in a note out Wednesday. “Historically, September is the worst-performing month of the year with the S&P 500 declining 0.7% on average. As such, we decided investigate the prospect of gold as a defensive hedge in the near term.” A Shiny September Dollar weakness is proving efficacious for gold this year. The U.S. Dollar Index is down 9.5 percent year-to-date, underscoring the greenback's status as one of the worst-performing currencies in the world. Gold, like other commodities, is denominated in dollars, meaning a weak dollar can equal strength for commodities. “There are several outside factors that impact the direction of gold, which has been in an uptrend since early July,” said Rosenbluth. “The direction of the dollar has the most significant correlation with gold prices. Inflation and interest rates also have an impact. The US Dollar Index is about 9% lower than where it began the year, while gold has appreciated by 13 percent over the same time period. Gold has a negative correlation of 48 with the dollar, explaining the opposite moves.” The current quarter is usually kind to gold while the fourth quarter can be a selling opportunity with the yellow metal. “Seasonally speaking, the third quarter is a period of strong performance for the commodity,” notes Rosenbluth. “Since 1978, gold's average price change was the highest during the July through September period, rising 4.3 percent on average 60 percent of the time. The fourth quarter has historically had the worst performance, rising only 29 basis points, with a frequency of advance pegged at only 44%. Therefore, if history is any guide, we are in the midst of the best three months of the year for gold.” Pick And Choose GLD is the world's largest gold-backed ETF and the most heavily traded. The ETF has about $33 billion in assets under management, more than triple the $9.3 billion found in IAU. However, IAU is the less expensive fund with an annual fee of 0.25 percent, or $25 on a $10,000 investment, compared to 0.4 percent on GLD.

2017-09-01,A New Gold ETF For Frugal Investors,"Exchange-traded funds have made gold investing accessible to a broader swath of investors, a theme pioneered by the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD). Today, GLD is the world's largest bullion-backed ETF and that success has, predictably, invited plenty of competition. Typically, the most effective way for issuers to compete with established rivals when it comes to “me too” or copycat ETFs is on cost. The iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) is not as big as GLD, but IAU has over $9.1 billion in assets under management. That is a testament to investors preferring IAU's annual fee of 0.25 percent compared to GLD's expense ratio of 0.4 percent. Well, there is a new sheriff in town when it comes to low-priced gold ETFs. The GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR) debuted Thursday and carries an annual fee of 0.2 percent, or $20 on a $10,000 investment. That makes BAR the least expensive gold ETF on the market today. Hitting The Bar “BAR is the third fund in the GraniteShares product suite, joining the GraniteShares Bloomberg Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 ETF (NYSE:COMB) and the GraniteShares S&P GSCI Commodity Broad Strategy No K-1 ETF (NYSE:COMG), both of which launched in May 2017 and are also among the least expensive commodities funds available,” according to ETF Trends. Like GLD and IAU, BAR is designed to track the price of gold. The new GraniteShares ETF holds physical gold, vaulted in London. The ETF's bar list will be published daily and its vaults will be inspected twice a year, according to GraniteShares. GraniteShares CEO Will Rhind “said the gold in BAR is going to be independently inspected by a third party specialist firm two times a year, which means investors can access the reports and look at the gold bars GraniteShares hold on its website,” according to ETF Trends. Good Timing Timing can be issue with new ETFs, but in the case of BAR, the rookie gold ETF could be well-timed. Although equity market volatility is low, investors have recently been flocking to gold due in part to geopolitical volatility. In August, investors added over $1 billion to GLD and nearly $250 million IAU. Bolstering the case for BAR is the weak dollar. The U.S. Dollar Index is down more than 9 percent this year, highlighting the greenback's status as one of the worst-performing major currencies in the world. Commodities, including gold, are denominated in dollars, meaning a weak dollar is usually beneficial to commodities.

2017-11-13,Gold Is Losing Some Glitter As Demand Wilts,"Gold and the corresponding exchange traded funds are encountering some fourth-quarter lethargy. Slack in demand is one reason why the once-soaring commodity is retreating in the latter stages of 2017. Over the past month, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest ETF backed by physical gold holdings, is lower by 2.2 percent, bringing its fourth-quarter loss to 1.5 percent. The iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) is displaying similar fourth-quarter numbers. Those declines come after bullion demand slumped in the third quarter. “The third quarter saw a 9 percent year-on-year drop in gold demand to 915 tonnes,” according to the World Gold Council. “Year-to-date demand was down by 12 percent. ETFs had another quarter of positive inflows, but at 18.9t, they fell far short of the 144.3t influx in Q3 2016. A softer quarter in the jewelry sector (negative 3 percent) accounted for 17t of the year-over-year decline. Demand from other sectors firmed: central banks bought a healthy 111t of gold (positive 25 percent percent year-over-year) while bar and coin investment strengthened by 17 percent (to 222.3t), albeit from a low base.” Fourth-Quarter Blues Some factors are weighing on gold this quarter. For example, the U.S. Dollar Index is higher by 1.3 percent since the start of the fourth quarter. Gold is denominated in dollars, meaning the yellow metal often has an inverse relationship to the greenback. It's widely expected that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its December meeting. Higher interest rates can weigh on gold demand because bullion does not pay dividends or interest. Fortunately for gold bugs, supply continues to decline. “Mine production fell 1 pecent year-over-year in Q3, which was also the fifth consecutive quarter of net de-hedging. Recycling activity (negative 6 percent) continued to normalize after jumping in 2016,” according to the WGC. Departures While data indicate gold ETFs added new assets in the third quarter, that scenario is reversing a bit in the fourth quarter. GLD has lost $865.4 million since the start of the current quarter, outflows exceeded by just two other ETFs. IAU has seen a fourth-quarter inflow of almost $301 million. “Jewelry volumes continue to languish below longer-term average levels. Indian weakness was the main reason for the year-over-year decline,” said the WGC. In India, “the new tax regime deterred consumers, as did anti-money laundering measures governing jewelry retail transactions.” Related Links: Plenty Of Rewards In This ETF A New Cheap Bond ETF Todd Shriber owns shares of IAU."
2017-11-21,How To Treat Gold ETFs Right Now,"Broadly speaking, gold exchange traded funds have been popular this year. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have added over $2.8 billion in new assets on a combined basis since the start of 2017. Since the start of the fourth quarter, gold ETFs have traded slightly and while fourth-quarter declines of about 1 percent for GLD and IAU are not alarming, gold's recent price action could be a sign that investors may want to consider adjusting their bullion allocations. That could be good advice ahead of the December Federal Reserve meeting. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates. Part of gold's allure in recent years has been low interest rates throughout the developed world. Gold ETFs, such as GLD and IAU, do not pay dividends or interest, meaning they are more attractive to investors as interest rates remain low. Dollar Impact As is the case with other commodities, gold is denominated in U.S. dollars, meaning a struggling greenback can lift the yellow metal. Indeed, the dollar has been one of this year's worst-performing major currencies, but that could change, making bullion vulnerable in the process. “One reason gold has done as well as it has year-to-date is weakness in the dollar,” said BlackRock in a recent note. “The U.S. Dollar (DXY) Index is down more than 9 percent from its early January high. More recently, however, the dollar has been firmer as investors have repositioned for a slightly more aggressive Federal Reserve (see the accompanying chart). In the near term I would expect a steadier dollar, particularly if the proposed tax cuts pass. A firm dollar removes another support for gold.” The U.S. Dollar Index is higher by about 1 percent over the past month. Near-Term Headwinds Right now probably is not the ideal time for investors to be adding to gold positions, but that does not mean the yellow metal and the related ETFs should be abandoned, either. “For most investors, this means somewhere in the mid to single digits, as a percentage of their asset allocation,” said BlackRock. “But it’s important to note, while the near-term environment for gold is not ideal, there are still good reasons to maintain some exposure, including the diversification benefits. With the exception of long-dated U.S. bonds, gold continues to be one of the more diversifying asset classes.” Related Links: A Cheap Bond ETF Nifty New Retail ETFs"
2018-02-19,The Luster On Gold ETFs Is Still Intact,"Major gold-backed exchange traded products, such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), are sporting solid year-to-date showings. Some market observers, however, are voicing concerns about the yellow metal after it declined during the volatility spike earlier this month. Gold's lack of positive response to the surge in the CBOE Volatility Index, also known as the VIX, vexed investors and led some to question the precious metal's safe-haven status. “With the CBOE Volatility Index reaching as high as 37 over the last two weeks, a level not seen since August 2015, it was agreed upon that fear had reentered the market,” said CFRA Research analyst Lindsey Bell in a note last week. “However, the price of gold, which is often considered a safe haven asset in times of uncertainty, declined just over 3 percent from its recent high on Jan. 25 through last Friday.” Remaining Steady Although gold disappointed a bit earlier this month, GLD and IAU are still up 3.5 percent this year and spot gold prices have remained above the technically important $1,300 per ounce level. “There are several outside factors that affect the direction of gold, which has steadily remained above the $1300 level since the start of 2018,” said Bell. “In actuality, the VIX has a low correlation to the direction of gold. The dollar on the other hand, has a significant correlation with gold prices. Inflation and interest rates also have an impact. The US Dollar Index is currently about 7 percent lower than its average price in 2017, while gold has appreciated by 5 percent over its average price in 2017.” The PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSE:UUP), which tracks the dollar's performance against the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc, is down 3.1 percent this year. An Inflation Hedge Rising inflation could be a catalyst for GLD, IAU and rival gold ETFs because the yellow metal is historically a favored hedge against rising consumer prices. “Gold has a negative correlation of 48 with the dollar, explaining the opposite moves. Inflation has a negative 17 correlation and the Federal Funds rate has a negative correlation of 57,” said Bell. “In other words, most simply put, the best environment to own gold is one in which the dollar, inflation and interest rates are declining.” “The January reading on consumer prices released on Wednesday showed prices rose more than expected, up 0.5 percent versus the 0.3 percent expectation,” reports Reuters. “The core reading rose 0.3 percent against the 0.2 percent forecast. Both numbers increased from the 0.2 percent reading for December.” Related Links: A Dividend Surprise in This ETF Vanguard Gets Active With New Factor ETFs Disclosure: The author owns shares of IAU."
2018-03-14,Rethinking The Bitcoin-Gold Comparison,"Digital currencies are a rapidly growing asset class and bitcoin is the primary driver of that growth. Bitcoin has been compared to gold during its meteoric rise, but some market participants believe the cryptocurrency has a long way to go before comparisons to bullion are relevant. One of the obvious sticking points comes from the world of exchange traded funds. U.S. regulators have yet to approve ETFs related to bitcoin — or any cryptocurrencies for that matter. Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission forced several ETF sponsors to scuttle applications for bitcoin-related ETFs. On the other hand, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), is the 20th-largest U.S.-listed ETF and has $35.4 billion in assets under management. The iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) is home to $11.2 billion in assets. There's an age factor as well: bitcoin has only been part of the investment lexicon since 2009. By some estimates, gold has been part of human history for 6,000 years. A Long Road Ahead Gold has a lengthy head start on digital currencies when it comes to relevancy in the international monetary system. On a large scale, gold is bought and sold by many of the world's largest central banks. Bullion is also a favored asset among many retail investors who are looking for ways to diversify portfolios away from bonds and equities or those looking to guard against inflation. Bitcoin has yet to develop a significant reputation on those fronts. “Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency developed and it only emerged on the scene as recently as 2009,” said George Milling-Stanley, head of gold strategy at State Street Global Advisors in a Tuesday note. “Until bitcoin has demonstrated over time that it can effectively transfer and preserve wealth, I don’t think it’s responsible to call it Gold 2.0.” SSgA, the third-largest U.S. ETF issuer, markets GLD. Concerns And Similarities Cryptocurrencies are volatile, making the asset class difficult to deploy in portfolios for many advisors and investors. Not only are digital currencies speculative, but the accessibility of cryptos is difficult for many investors relative to ETFs such as GLD and IAU. Yet there are similarities shared by bitcoin and gold. For example, neither is controlled by a central bank in the way the dollar is supposedly controlled by the Federal Reserve. “The other similarity is scarce supply. Bitcoin is engineered to slowly decline to zero growth around the year 2140, where it will reach maximum capacity of 21 million digital coins,” said Milling-Stanley. “Gold doesn’t have a set date or maximum capacity, but on average approximately 3,200 tonnes of gold have been mined every year, adding about 1.7 percent of the total stock of gold ever mined.” Related Links: A Convincing Commodities ETF Young, But Strong ETFs Disclosure: The author owns shares of IAU."
2018-04-11,A New ETF Of ETFs For Diverse Asset Allocation,"A new exchange traded fund aimed at providing diverse asset allocation while limiting volatility debuted Tuesday. The VanEck Vectors Real Asset Allocation ETF (NYSE:RAXX) provides exposure to real assets using the ETF-of-ETFs model. RAXX “seeks to maximize real returns while seeking to reduce downside risk during sustained market declines by allocating primarily to exchange-traded products that provide exposure to real assets, which include commodities, real estate, natural resources and infrastructure,” according to VanEck. The new ETF debuted holding 10 other ETFs, six of which are VanEck funds. RAXX can hold up to 12 ETFs and can go to 100-percent cash in the event of elevated market stress. The RAXX Report RAXX allocates over half its weight to just two ETFs: the PowerShares Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 Portfolio (NASDAQ:PDBC) and the VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE:MOO). The actively managed PDBC features exposure to a broad basket of commodities, including West Texas Intermediate crude, Brent crude, wheat, natural gas, zinc, aluminum, corn, soybeans, gasoline and gold. Speaking of gold, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), the two largest gold ETFs, combine for about 20 percent of RAXX's roster. RAXX holdings “provide exposure to agribusiness, coal, infrastructure, real estate, steel, oil services, unconventional oil and gas and gold mining companies, as well as diversified commodity futures exposure and physical gold,” according to VanEck. Income And Adventure RAXX provides some income-generating potential with modest exposure to master limited partnerships via an almost 5-percent weight to the Global X MLP&Energy Infrastructure ETF (NYSE:MLPX). The new ETF also debuted with some higher beta sector and industry plays, including the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSE:OIH) and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). “RAAX performance is dependent on the performance of underlying funds and is subject to the risks of the underlying funds’ investments,” according to the issuer.

2018-05-07,A New Low-Fee Gold ETF Is Coming,"Home to $36.58 billion in assets under management as of May 3, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) is the world's largest exchange traded fund backed by physical holdings of gold. While GLD remains the go-to choice among gold ETFs for many professional investors due to robust liquidity and tight spreads, it has been losing market share to lower costs rivals, such as the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU). The World Gold Council, which sponsors GLD, is looking to make its presence felt in the low-fee gold ETF tussle with a cheaper product of its own. “The World Gold Council, owner of the world’s largest gold-backed exchange traded fund, is launching a new fund with a cut-price management fee to fend off rivals with lower charges, Reuters reported, citing an unidentified source close to the issue. What Happened GLD debuted in November 2004 as the world's first ETF backed by gold, giving it a significant advantage over later-arriving rivals. The fund even spent a brief period of time as the world's largest ETF of any type. Today, GLD is the 18th-largest U.S.-listed ETF, but by far the largest commodities ETF. Investors have also widely preferred GLD to gold miners equity ETFs, as GLD is more than six times larger than the biggest gold miners fund. Why It's Important The WGC's move to compete on fees is notable because GLD charges 0.4 percent per year, or $40 on a $10,000 investment. That is 15 basis points higher than the annual fee on IAU. IAU debuted two months after GLD and has $12.21 billion in assets under management today. The GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR) debuted in August and charges 0.2 percent per year. The ETF has $14.44 million in assets. It is expected that the new WGC fund will charge in the area of 0.25 percent annually, according to Reuters. What's Next Fees matter across the ETF landscape and that is true with gold ETFs as well. In recent years, IAU has been growing at a far more rapid rate than GLD due in large part to the former's significantly lower fee. “The source said the council’s two funds were designed to appeal to different audiences, with the new product targeted at investors looking to buy and hold gold who want a low management fee, and GLD aimed at financial investors who use its scale and liquidity to trade in and out of positions cheaply,” Reuters reported.

2018-05-07,Demand Challenges Linger For Gold ETFs,"Gold exchange traded funds were decent performers in the first quarter, as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) each gained 0.5 percent. Those performances were arguably impressive in the face of slack demand. Recent data points from the World Gold Council confirm first-quarter gold demand was tepid. “Gold demand of 973.5t was the lowest Q1 since 2008,” said the WGC. “The main cause was a fall in investment demand for gold bars and gold-backed ETFs, partly due to rangebound gold prices.” What Happened Specific to gold ETFs, products such as GLD and IAU were resilient to tepid demand in the first three months of 2018 as investors embraced gold ETFs amid increased equity market volatility. The U.S. dollar was weak for much of Q1, providing an assist to dollar-denominated commodities like gold. In Q1, investors allocated nearly $399 million to GLD, the world's largest gold-backed ETF. IAU saw $1.19 billion in Q1 inflows. Investors favored gold funds even as the Federal Reserve boosted borrowing costs in March, a move that is often seen as punitive to gold because the yellow metal does not offer coupon payments or dividends. Why It's Important “Jewelry demand was steady at 487.7t, as growth in China and the U.S. compensated for weaker Indian demand. Central banks bought 116.5t of gold (42-percent-plus year-over-year),” according to the WGC. “Technology demand extended its recent upward trend, growing 4 percent year-over-year to 82.1t. The total supply of gold increased by 3 percent to 1,063.5t, primarily due to a modest increase in producer hedging. Mine production was fractionally higher at 770t.” Q1 marked the fifth straight quarter of inflows to gold ETFs, but in the first three months of the year, major gold buyers such as China, the U.S. and Germany pared demand for bullion. What's Next Gold is off to a rough in the second quarter. The dollar is surging to start the current quarter, sending GLD and IAU lower by more than 2 percent. Still, investors remain fond of GLD and IAU. The two largest gold ETFs have added $850 million and $760 million, respectively, in Q2.

2018-06-26,"GLD's Mini-Me Launched By World Gold Council, State Street Global Advisors","Fee wars permeate nearly every corner of the exchange traded funds universe, including commodities funds. It's particularly true with gold ETFs, where issuers are looking to attract more assets with favorable costs. The latest example of this trend is the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM), which debuted Tuesday. What Happened GLDM is issued in partnership by the World Gold Council and State Street Global Advisors, the third-largest U.S. ETF issuer. The two organizations introduced investors to gold ETFs via the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold ETF. “GLDM will be initially listed at a per-share trading price of 1/100th of an ounce of gold, as represented by the LBMA Gold Price PM,” according to a statement issued by SSgA and the WGC. Why It's Important A simple way of looking at GLDM is that is in the “mini-me” version of GLD. Importantly, the new gold ETF sports a significantly lower expense ratio. GLDM's annual fee is 0.18 percent, or $18 on a $10,000 investment — well below the 0.4 percent charged by GLD and below the 0.25 percent charged by the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), the second-largest U.S.-listed gold ETF behind GLD. “GLDM offers the lowest available total expense ratio among all gold exchange-traded products, with a net and gross expense ratio of 0.18 percent,” according to the statement. GLDM is the third gold-backed launched by SSgA and the WGC. GLD and the SPDR Long Dollar Gold Trust (NYSE:GLDW) are the others. What's Next With GLDM being a new ETF, it is too early to judge the fund's asset-gathering proficiency, but it is reasonable to expect the fund will be successful as more advisers and investors gravitate toward ETFs with lower fees. “For many investors, costs associated with buying and selling the shares in the secondary market and the payment of GLDM's ongoing expenses will be lower than the costs associated with buying and selling gold bullion and storing and insuring gold bullion in a traditional allocated gold bullion account,” according to SsgA.

2019-02-02,Central Banks Drove Gold Demand In 2018,"Gold and the related exchange traded funds were challenged last year by the strong dollar and rising U.S. interest rates, but that did not prevent some buyers from stepping up bullion purchases. New data from the World Gold Council shows global gold demand increased by 4 percent last year. What Happened “Gold demand in 2018 reached 4,345.1t, up from 4,159.9t in 2017 and in line with the five-year average of 4,347.5t,” according to the WGC. Last year, investors pulled $1.79 billion from the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed ETF, but investors did allocate capital to lower-cost gold ETFs. For example, the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) saw $1.59 billion worth of inflows last year. The GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR), one of the newest and cheapest gold ETFs, saw 2018 inflows of just over $310 million. Why It's Important While U.S. ETF purchases of gold were mixed throughout 2018, global central banks supported bullion demand in significant fashion. “A multi-decade high in central bank buying (651.5t) drove growth,” said the WGC. “Demand was bumped up in Q4 by 112.4t of ETF inflows, but annual inflows into these products (of 68.9t) were 67% lower than 2017.” Central bank gold purchases were the second-highest on record last year as central banks in Russia and Turkey, among others, embraced the yellow metal. “Net purchases jumped to their highest since the end of US dollar convertibility into gold in 1971, as a greater pool of central banks turned to gold as a diversifier,” according to the WGC. What's Next With dollar strength moderating and expectations in place that the Federal Reserve wont' raise interest rates this year, each of the aforementioned U.S.-listed gold ETFs have added new assets, led by $1.51 billion of inflows to GLD. Last year, “coin demand surged to reach a five-year high of 236.4t, the second highest on record. Demand for gold bars held steady at 781.6t, the fifth year in succession of holding in a firm 780-800t range,” according to the WGC.

2019-06-04,Fidelity Adds 11 Issuers To Commission-Free ETF Lineup,"As part of its previously announced expansion, Fidelity's commission-free exchange traded funds platform includes ETFs from 11 issuers new to the lineup. What Happened In February, Boston-based Fidelity announced plans to boost the size of its commission-free ETF offering to over 500 funds. Previously, the firm's no commission ETF stable featured only Fidelity funds and iShares products. Fidelity is adding to that stable in significant fashion with the addition of 150 ETFs from 11 other sponsors. Why It's Important The issuers new to the Fidelity commission-free ETF suite are American Century, First Trust, Franklin Templeton, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Invesco, Janus Henderson, John Hancock Investments, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Legg Mason Global Asset Management, PIMCO andState Street Global Advisors SPDR ETFs. The ETFs available to Fidelity clients sans commission hail from 69 Morningstar investment categories and have average annual expense ratios of 0.36 percent. “Industry assets under management in Fidelity’s available commission-free ETFs account for 40% of the overall U.S. ETF market,” said Fidelity in a Monday statement. “Fidelity has more than $450 billion in ETF client assets under administration.” Fidelity has over 28 million brokerage accounts for institutional and retail investors. What's Next Well-known iShares funds on Fidelity's commission-free platform include the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), iShares MSIC Hong Kong ETF (NYSE:EWH), iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSE:FXI) and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:EEM). Popular SPDR ETFs available to Fidelity clients without commission include the SPDR DoubleLine Short Duration Total Return Tactical ETF (CBOE: STOT) and the SPDR DoubleLine Emerging Markets Fixed Income ETF (CBOE: EMTL). Large Invesco ETFs on the Fidelity commission-free platform include the Invesco Emerging Markets Sovereign Debt ETF (NYSE:PCY) and the Invesco S&P Emerging Markets Low Volatility ETF (NYSE:EELV) as well as several other alternative, fixed income and international equity funds. iShares, SPDR and Invesco are the largest, third- and fourth-largest U.S ETF sponsors, respectively.

2019-06-28,Gold ETFs Are Having A Moment,"In the precious metals arena these days, gold and the related exchange traded funds are getting plenty of attention and rightfully so. Though it was flat Thursday, the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) is up 10% this month and is one of several gold ETFs that has recently been flirting with or hitting 52-week highs. What Happened The $13.23 billion IAU is one of the largest gold ETFs in the world and holds over 9.4 million troy ounces of bullion in its trust, according to issuer data. IAU is up nearly 10% this year. “Global investors have increased their positions in gold exchange traded funds (ETFs) by $4.3 billion from May 14th, one day after the S&P 500 Index’s 2.4% trade tension driven drop, through June 20,” said BlackRock in a recent note. “This pushed the year to date total of ETF flows into gold focused products back into positive territory.” Why It's Important One of the primary reasons gold is rallying is expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at some point this year and that, in turn, will weaken the dollar. The Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSE:UUP), which tracks the greenback against a basket of major developed market currencies, is down 1.63% this month. “Gold’s performance at times of geopolitical volatility underscores its potential value as a portfolio diversifier,” said BlackRock. “However, gold has also performed well amid strong equity markets this year as real interest rates fell.” Spot gold resides around $1,400 per troy ounce, a price area that if held, commodities market observers believe could usher in a new bull market for the yellow metal. What's Next Primary drivers of gold demand include global central banks, long-term investors, including those buying gold bars and coins and ETFs like IAU, and industrial users. However, short-term speculators remain important in driving gold prices. “Still, a high proportion of annual demand for gold is based solely on investment demand,” according to BlackRock. “This can expose the price of the metal to a large amount of speculation. The World Gold Council data suggests that only 59% of demand is for commercial uses; 26% of 2018 gold demand was for investment purposes while another 15% was demanded by central banks.” Disclosure: The author owns shares of IAU.

2020-06-05,"Gold ETFs Shatter Previous Years Records, And Were Not Even Halfway Into 2020","Led by the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the category's big kahuna, gold exchange-traded funds are on torrid asset-gathering paces this year. What Happened Not only are assets under management at gold ETFs, in aggregate, residing at all-time highs, but year-to-date inflows to these products are beating any previous year's record not even halfway through 2020. “Continuing their growth streak, gold-backed ETFs (gold ETFs) added 154 tonnes (t) – net inflows of US$8.5bn (+4.3%) across all regions in May, boosting global holdings to a new all-time high of 3,510t,” according to the World Gold Council. “Year-to-date, inflows (623t, US$33.7bn) now exceed the highest level of annual inflows (591t) seen in 2009.” Year to date, investors have added $12.95 billion to GLD, the largest bullion-backed ETF in the world. Only two other ETFs have seen larger inflows. Why It's Important Low interest rates in the U.S., debased currencies and loose monetary in other countries, global central bank buying of gold and investors' thirst for safe-haven assets against the backdrop of the coronavirus are providing a perfect storm for gold ETFs. “Positive flows combined with a rising gold price also pushed assets under management (AUM) in gold ETFs to new record highs of US$195bn, even as stock and bond prices increased,” said the WGC. “Global gold ETFs had inflows in all but two trading days during April and May (41 of 43 days). The only other historical period with similarly consistent inflows occurred in May and June of 2016, when funds experienced inflows in all but four trading days.” Other gold ETFs attracting capital at impressive rates include the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), which added $4.43 billion in the year-to-date period. What's Next Data confirm gold ETFs are popular with investors around the world, but North America remains the driving force in this category. “North American-listed gold ETFs led regional inflows during May. Flows in the region are historically more correlated with gold’s price behaviour,” said the WGC. “The region’s funds led inflows for a second straight month, adding 102t (US$5.6bn, 5.6% AUM). North American funds now hold 1,815t of gold, surpassing the previous highs of 1,736t they held in December 2012. European funds added 45t (US$2.4bn, 2.9%), led by UK-based funds, which accounted for 65% of the total in the region. Asian funds – primarily in China – grew, adding 4.4t (US$262mn, 4.7%), and funds in other regions grew 4.3%, adding 2.6t and US$136mn.” Investors are also flocking to lower-cost gold ETFs as the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM) and the GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR), two of the least expensive funds in the category, have added more than $1.6 billion combined.

2020-08-24,3 Gold ETFs Seeing Brisk Short Covering Activity,"Thanks in large part to demand by investors opting for gold exchange-traded funds, gold is one of this year's hottest assets. However, the yellow metal, like any other security, doesn't move up in a straight line. The largest gold ETF enters Monday 6.39% off its 52-week high after trading modestly lower last week. Two interesting things to consider here. First, gold ETFs dipped last week even amid rampant short covering. Second, there's a massive amount of short interest in some marquee gold ETFs to be unwound. Three gold ETFs “landed in the top ten most short covered ETFs league table over the last week with $160 million worth of new buy-to-covers. Gold’s +28% move for the year and hitting its year to date high in early August may be squeezing some Gold ETF short sellers out of their positions,” according to S3 Partners research. Here are those three ETFs. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Up almost 40% this year, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is chastening bearish traders. Last week, the largest gold miners resisted the commodity's decline, rising 1.34% on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) took a stake in Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). That stock is GDX's second-largest component at a weight of just over 12%. More than $90 million of short interest in GDX was covered last week, but short interest as a percentage of the ETF's float is still close to 10% and valued at $1.76 billion, according to S3, meaning it will take some time for shorts to cover this trade. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) is the largest physically-backed gold ETF and a favorite of professional traders on both sides of the bullish/bearish spectrum, owing to robust liquidity and tight spreads. Traders covered almost $30 million worth of GLD shorts last week, but there's still $2.62 billion of short interest in the benchmark gold ETF, equivalent to 3.37% of the fund's float, notes S3. As is the case with GDX, it's likely to take bearish traders weeks, not days, to unwind that GLD short. iShares Gold Trust (IAU) Traders covered almost $40 million worth of bearish exposure in the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) last week, whittling short interest in that ETF $93.57 million. That's just 0.30% of the float, indicating those shorts could cover in rapid fashion if need be. “Short sellers in these three Gold ETFs are down -$760 million in year-to-date mark-to-market losses,” notes S3.

2021-07-01,Gold Is A Natural Hedge Against Bad Fed Policy,"Gold doesn’t get any respect for its core attribute. Some investors think of gold as an inflation hedge because it has maintained its purchasing power over time. Others seem to think that gold is some type of hedge against a stock market crash. Yet gold doesn’t correlate with the stock market and it doesn’t move in lockstep with the Consumer Price Index. It is a hedge against the federal government making bad fiscal policy. While inflation does come about because of bad policy, it isn’t a cause-and-effect relationship with the world’s favorite shiny metal. Gold is the ultimate hedge on the government screwing up, and they have been screwing up quite a bit this new century. Since 2000 gold has handily beat stocks appreciating over 500% while the total returns of the S&P 500 are a bit north of 190%. There is no question that this is the result of the federal government spending like a drunken sailor. After the crash in 2008, the Federal Reserve decided it would be better to bail out the economy at the cost of the solvency of the US government. The credit rating agencies realized that they had to downgrade US government debt. Twenty years ago the Federal Reserve had a 6.5% interest rate target and inflation was in check. Not only was there no government deficit but the dollar was strong. This was all before the world caught the virus. Of course, I don’t mean COVID but rather the dangerous idea that we can just print however much money we want and spend it. Since then the M2 money supply has increased from 4.6 trillion to over 20.3 trillion. Fast forward to where we are today and they are pretty clearly playing monetary policy fast and loose. Interest rates are as close as they could be to zero and real returns are quite negative accounting for a 5% increase in consumer prices over the last year. Not only has the Federal Reserve purchased a wide array of government bonds and mortgage bonds but they have also taken the place of private lenders buying into the corporate bond market via ETFs. The idea of fiscal discipline has been replaced with Modern Monetary Theory running a budget deficit north of a trillion. While the problem for investors that are looking to hedge their portfolio against the bad policy is clear, the solution is less obvious. Many investors resort to gold ETFs that don’t generate any earnings or pay a yield like iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) or SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Another alternative is the Solactive Gold Backed Bond Index which has been a great solution for investors that need a fiscal policy hedge from gold and income from bonds. The index generates a consistent yield from a portfolio of investment-grade corporate bonds of approximately 2.5% then hedges that portfolio against inflation with gold. Since the portfolio has a full 100% exposure to gold it generated a historical return pre-inception on January 3, 2006, through today of 14.57% annualized. This combination of a gold hedge and bonds has beaten the total returns of both gold all by itself and bonds. The Strategy Shares Gold Hedged Bond ETF (BATS:GLDB) is designed to track the returns of the Solactive Gold Backed Bond Index and distributes a monthly yield. The other alternative that is available to some Indian investors is Sovereign Gold Bonds that are denominated in grams of gold and pay a yield of approximately 2.5% as well. Yet, US-domiciled corporate bonds seem like a safer bet than Indian government bonds for a comparable yield."

2023-01-03,Gold Hits 6-Month High Ahead Of Fed Minutes Release — Why Experts See A Bright 2023 For Bullion,"Ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting minutes on Wednesday, gold prices hit a six-month high, albeit in thin trading. Spot gold was trading higher by 0.98% at $1,841.55 per ounce at the time of writing. The dollar index fell 0.1%, making greenback-priced bullion more attractive for overseas buyers, reported Reuters. Also Read: How To Invest In Startups Gold is one of the best hedges against inflation and economic uncertainties, but in a higher interest rate environment, the opportunity cost of holding gold is high as the commodity does not yield interest. The yellow metal registered a pretty flat performance in 2022. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) posted a return of just 0.78% in the last year while the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) returned 0.96%. Expert Take: However, experts have been positive on gold this year. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad tweeted his forecasts for the yellow metal and silver for 2023. “I became a gold bug in 1972. I was a Marine pilot in Vietnam flying behind enemy lines hoping to buy gold at a discount because the mine was in enemy hands. Found out the price of gold is the same all over the world. I predict silver going to $75 and gold to $3,800 in 2023,” he said. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note the dollar and yield movements would be a key focus for the gold market, according to the Reuters report. “The de-dollarization seen by several central banks last year, when a record amount of gold was bought, look set to continue, thereby providing a soft floor under the market,” Hansen said.

2023-01-12,Gold Steady After Hitting 8-Month High Ahead Of Inflation Data: What Traders Expect From Fed In Feb,"Ahead of the release of U.S. inflation data on Thursday, which could drive the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, gold prices held steady after hitting an eight-month peak on Wednesday. Spot gold was steady at $1,883.95 per ounce at the time of writing. The SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM) has gained 8.72% in the last six months while the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) gained 8.67%. Traders expect a 77% chance the central bank will raise the benchmark rate by 25 bps to 4.50%-4.75% in February and see rates peaking at 4.92% by June, according to Reuters. Also Read: Gold IRA Kit Expert Take: Jim Wyckoff, senior analyst at Kitco Metals said prices were trending lower on some profit-taking from the shorter-term futures traders ahead of the CPI report tomorrow, according to the Reuters report. He added that the market could continue to trade sideways ahead of the data. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at OANDA said this could be a big report “if we get another good reading that shows inflation falling faster than anticipated, the report said. While concerns linger over the scale and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in top gold consumer China, over the longer term, China is expected to bounce back strongly, which could stimulate additional demand, Erlam added.

2023-03-22,Here's A Gold Rally Sympathy Play With 32% Upside Potential: Analyst,"Gold prices have been on a rollercoaster ride since last week, with investors selling off their gold holdings in the wake of the abating fears over the U.S. banking crisis. Prices of the precious metal soared past the $2,000 level earlier this week, but fell 1.92% to $1,944 on Tuesday. Despite market turbulence, analyst Gianni Di Poce believes that there is still upside potential for gold-exposed stocks, particularly Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD). Check out Benzinga's precious metals page. The GOLD Analyst: Di Poce, in his weekly “Benzinga Pro Insider Report,” said he is bullish on Barrick Gold as long as shares stay above the $16 level, and set a price target of between $24 and $26 on the stock. Di Poce noted that Barrick brought in $11.01 billion in revenue in 2022, along with $432 million in earnings. While the valuation metrics for the company are mixed, with a high P/E of 72.50 but a more moderate Price-to-Sales of 2.79 and an EV to EBITDA of 7.77, the technical analysis for the stock is bullish. Barrick recently broke out from a falling wedge formation and is now retesting former-resistance-turned-support, Di Poce said, creating a higher-low and implying higher prices ahead. Barrick is focused on operating Tier One mining assets, with the ability to produce over 500,000 ounces of gold per year. If gold prices rally, it could translate to a significant increase in forward revenue. The company also has at least 10 years of productive life remaining in its current mines. That's a crucial factor to consider when looking at mining companies since they extract a finite natural resource. Barrick is expected to produce roughly 6.5 million ounces of gold and copper alloy equivalents into 2032. It has also significantly cleaned up its balance sheet in recent years by paying down debt and boosting its cash flow, the analyst noted. Free quarterly cash flow is now $1.24 billion, and the company is keen on returning capital to its shareholders with a payout ratio of around 229%. While the gold market may be turbulent at present, Di Poce’s analysis suggests that Barrick could be a solid investment choice for those seeking exposure to the precious metal.

2023-03-22,Banking Crisis Sparks Gold Frenzy: Analysts Expect Bullion Prices To Shatter Previous Records,"As the Federal Reserve is scheduled to announce its monetary policy amid the lingering banking crisis, analysts say gold prices have more potential to rise and possibly break all-time highs. Tina Teng from financial services company CMC Markets told CNBC she expects the yellow metal to trade between $2,500 to $2,600 an ounce. A sooner Fed pivot on rate hikes will likely cause another gold price surge due to a potential further decline in the U.S. dollar and bond yields, she said. Also Read: The Best Gold ETFs Price Action: Spot gold was trading at $1,939 per ounce at the time of writing. On Monday, it breached the $2,000 mark to hit its highest since March 2022. Gold's all-time high stands at $2,075 in August 2020, the report said citing Refinitiv data. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have gained over 6% in the last month. U.S. markets ended in the green on Tuesday as fears over a liquidity crunch in the banking system ebbed and focus shifted to the Federal Reserve policy meeting where the bulk of the market participants expect the central bank to raise rates by 25 bps. Expert Take: CEO Randy Smallwood of Wheaton Precious Metals said continued central bank buying of gold bodes well for long-term prices. Smallwood estimates gold prices to touch $2,500. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at OANDA, said gold might be in for a strong performance in the coming months. The stars appear to be aligning for gold which could see it break new highs before long, he said. Also Read: First Republic Bank Rescue Deal May Depend On Government Entering The Picture: Report"
2023-03-31,Peter Schiff Says Investors Running Out Of Time To Buy Gold Below $2K Per Ounce: 'Don't Get Left Behind',"Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, believes investors may be running out of time to buy gold below the $2,000 per ounce price, as the yellow metal has embarked on an upward path in the wake of sticky inflation. What Happened: Time is running out to buy #gold for less than $2K per ounce. Once gold breaks above $2.1K it’s off to the races. Don’t get left behind. The choice between fighting #inflation and mitigating a financial crisis was always inevitable, as was the Fed’s choice, Schiff said in his tweet. Also Read: Gold IRA Kit A weaker dollar and falling bond yields drove demand for the precious metal as it rose about 1% on Thursday. Spot gold was last trading close to the $1,978-per ounce level during Asian trading hours. Last week, it touched the $2,000-per ounce level. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have gained over 8% in last one month. Expert Take: Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities, told Reuters that much of this rally continues to be a short covering rally. “The catalyst here is the continued expectations that rates in the U.S. will top out,” Melek said. Last week, multiple analysts indicated gold prices have more potential to rise and possibly break all-time highs. Market participants are now eyeing the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of underlying price pressures. “Anything below expectations on the core (PCE) would imply that there is less need or requirement for tight monetary policy from the Federal Reserve,” Melek told Reuters.

2023-04-04,Peter Schiff Believes Inflation-Hedging Assets Like Gold Set For A Breakout — But What About Bitcoin?,"Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, believes assets used to hedge against inflation like gold are set to breakout soon while dollar and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) are on the verge of a breakdown. What Happened: I think risk assets will soon breakdown hard, led lower by #Bitcoin. #Inflation hedges are about to breakout, lead higher by precious metals miners. As I titled my last podcast, #gold stocks are the new tech #stocks. Either prepare for this new reality or suffer the consequences, he said in a tweet. Also Read: How To Invest In Startups Indeed, spot gold has risen from the lows of $1,622 levels seen in October 2022 to trade close to the $2,000 per ounce levels in recent days. It was last seen trading at $1,980 per ounce during Asian trading. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have gained over 7% in last one month. Schiff is of the view that investors have been far too complacent and said they have no appreciation of the magnitude of the problem created by the Federal Reserve. We could be days away from a major breakdown in the U.S. dollar and breakout in #gold. Perhaps this will finally be the wake-up call investors need, he said in his tweet. Inflation Problem: The recent production cut announcement by OPEC+ has become the latest headache for the central bank as it tries to rein-in inflation while simultaneously attempting to resolve the banking crisis. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the market is considering close to 55% probability of a 25 basis points rate hike in the next FOMC meet. Schiff expects long term interest rates to rise at a time when inflation strengthens and economy weakens and says that falling dollar and rising oil and gold prices are bad signs. Surging #oil prices is bad news for tech #stocks as it highlights that the #inflation problem will only get worse. The trend of lower YoY #CPI numbers is over. Future increases will be trending higher from here. That limits the #Fed’s ability to cut rates, even as QE accelerates, he tweeted.

2023-04-05,"Gold Eyes Record High On Safe-Haven Status, Weak Dollar, Hopes Of Softening Fed: Peter Schiff Sees 'Spectacular' Rally","Gold continued its upward momentum over the $2,000 per ounce level during Tuesday morning Asian trade supported by a decline in the dollar and rising expectations that the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy may be nearing its end. Spot gold was trading at $2,022 per ounce at the time of writing. The commodity has risen from the lows of $1,622 levels seen in October 2022 and has been trading close to the $2,000 per ounce level in recent days. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have gained over 9% in the last month. Also Read: Gold IRA Kit It is noteworthy that gold-linked stocks like AngloGold Ashanti Limited (NYSE:AU), SSR Mining Inc (NASDAQ:SSRM) and Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) have made gains ranging from over 15% to 46% in the last month. On the economy front, U.S. job openings in February declined to the lowest level in about two years while factory orders dropped for a second straight month indicating the economy may be weakening. This is likely to have raised investor expectations about Fed's rate hikes nearing their end in the foreseeable future. A weakening dollar is also helping push the yellow metal higher, which could test its record high of $2,075.47 seen in August 2020. Expert Take: David Lennox, an analyst at Sydney-based Fat Prophets told Bloomberg that gold price is primarily now being driven by concerns about the dollar. Bullion is enjoying a safe haven premium in the wake of financial fears including the recent banking crisis and geopolitical tensions, he added. Experts like Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, have been sounding out the likelihood of gold prices witnessing a surge. Today the #gold price closed at a new 52-week high. Yet senior miners still need to rise by over 20% and juniors by over 25% to hit new 52-week highs. The divergence is due to negative sentiment. Investors still don’t believe the rally is real. It’s real and will be spectacular, he tweeted. Read Next: Federal Reserve’s Loretta Mester Expects Likelihood Of More Rate Hikes — Here’s Why"
2023-04-13,Peter Schiff Says Real Reason Gold Prices Are Rising Is Because 'High Inflation Is Here To Stay',"Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, says the real reason gold prices are rising is because of the belief that inflation will continue to stay higher. What Happened: The catalyst for this morning’s $20 jump in the #gold price is the Mar. #CPI rising a bit less than expected. But core CPI still spiked .4%, which annualizes to over 5%. The real reason gold is rising is that high #inflation is here to stay. Soon YoY CPI gains will hit new highs, Schiff tweeted.

Schiff also believes when the Fed actually ends up cutting rate, the markets are likely to witness a sell-off leading to fund flows into the yellow metal. When the financial crisis finally causes the #Fed to cut rates, U.S. stock and bond markets will likely sell off, having already rallied in anticipation of that capitulation. But the dollar will fall too, sending investors into #gold, foreign value stocks, and emerging markets, Schiff said.

There’s still a tremendous amount of risk on the table, so gold should still see some strong flows headed its way, Moya said.

Price Action: Gold prices had declined sharply on Friday, dragged by hawkish comments by Federal Reserve officials that strengthened bets for at least one more interest rate hike. Two central bank officials on Thursday reiterated the need for more interest rate hikes to rein in inflation just as the Fed is set to enter a silent period from April 22 to May 4, ahead of its next monetary policy announcement.

Once gold breaks above $2.1K it's off to the races. Don't get left behind.

The phrase “in determining the extent of future increases in the target range” was deleted from the FOMC’s May policy statement and replaced with “in determining the extent to which additional policy firming may be appropriate.” Apart from the rate hike pause, the one thing that is still working in favor of gold is its safe haven status as banking turmoil seems far from over. Expert Take: Yeap Jun Rong, market analyst at IG, told Reuters that concerns in the banking space remain unresolved, which will put a cautious stance in the risk environment, pulling safe-haven flows for gold in the event of further fallouts. The analyst also said, Lower yields and a weaker dollar in the aftermath of the recent Fed meet and changes in the policy statement language providing the conviction that the central bank will likely shift towards a rate pause.

Also Read: Gold IRA Kit Kiyosaki's comments come in the wake of the U.S. Treasury Department selling one-month bills at the highest-ever yield for the tenor. The government on Thursday sold $50 billion of four-week securities at a record yield of 5.84% which is the highest for any Treasury bill issue since 2000, reported Blomberg. Why It Matters: The record yields signal fear among investors after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the government could run short of cash as soon as early June as the debt ceiling impasse continues. It is noteworthy that investors are willing to pay such a high yield for short-term securities during an auction when a risk-on environment prevails. In other words, market participants are diverting funds into safe-haven instruments, like treasuries, to prevent any potential melt-down in their portfolios in case the default actually takes place and markets go for a toss.

What Happened: Spot gold was trading 0.36% higher near the $2,023 per ounce level during Monday morning Asian trading session, while dollar index trended lower by 0.11%, making the yellow metal attractive to offshore buyers. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) closed over 1.5% lower on Friday. Also Read: How To Invest In Oil Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade, told Reuters that any signs of inflation being subdued would hinder the dollar due to lower interest rate expectations from the central bank, which could see gold trend higher. Furthermore, other factors that could impact gold prices are the banking sector health in the U.S. as well as the debt ceiling crisis. Till either of these continue to persist, the safe haven appeal of gold will continue to attract investor interest, pushing prices higher. Oil: Strong labor data released on Friday calmed recessionary fears to some extent which boosted oil prices. West Texas Intermediate futures expiring in June was trading 0.6% higher at $71.76 per barrel on Monday morning. WTI prices are still below the highs of over $83 per barrel level attained in mid-April this year. The level has witnessed a strong resistance this year. Inflation data release in the U.S. and China, among other economic indicators, will be keenly watched out by oil traders this week.

The United States Brent Oil Fund (NYSE:BNO) closed 3.99% higher while the Vanguard Energy Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VDE) gained 2.81% on Friday. Tina Teng, an analyst at CMC Markets said oil’s rebound follows energy stocks’ comeback on Wall Street on Friday after the U.S. reported strong job data that eased concerns about an imminent economic recession. Crude prices may continue to take the rebounding tailwind, Teng said, according to a Reuters report. ANZ Research pointed out that the market focus will shift to the tightening oil supply and that OPEC+ output cuts and a rebound in China's demand will likely offset slower demand elsewhere. We still expect overall demand to grow by 2mb/d, keeping the market under-supplied through this year. Therefore, we expect prices to bottom-out soon, it said.

Spot gold was trading 0.16% higher at $2,024.60 per ounce during Tuesday afternoon Asian trade. Ajay Kedia, director at Mumbai-based Kedia Commodities told Reuters if the inflation report comes in hot and sparks concerns about another rate hike in June by the Federal Reserve, the price of the yellow metal could eventually drop to the $1,950-$1,920 level. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) closed over 0.1% higher on Monday. Also Read: How To Invest In Gold Another factor that could impact gold prices is the banking sector crisis. “If there is news of further stress in the banking sector, we will see gold move towards the $2,100 level,” Kedia said. This is because gold acts as a safe haven in times of distress and any signs of turmoil in the economy would send investors into a risk-off mode, driving fund flows into the yellow metal. Debt Ceiling: Meanwhile, the debt ceiling saga is also among the most watched events in current times that will determine the direction of markets and investor sentiments. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are scheduled to meet on Tuesday in regard to the debt ceiling crisis. However, the National Association of Government Employees Inc. (NAGE) – a union representing 75,000 federal agency and military employees – reportedly sued President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday and have asked a federal judge to order Yellen to continue borrowing if talks to raise the national debt ceiling fail.

What Happened: Schiff also cited legendary investor Warren Buffett's remarks in his tweet.

The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) closed over 0.6% higher on Tuesday. If inflation continues to remain high, the Federal Reserve will be forced to continue its rate hikes, thereby leading to a potential rise in the greenback.

Hareesh V, the research head at Geojit Financial Services, told Reuters that if the U.S. inflation remains moderately controlled, it may lead to a pause in Fed rate hikes, which will weaken the dollar and support gold.

2023-05-11,Peter Schiff On Why Gold Fell Wednesday: 'Persistent Inflation Is Actually Very Bullish' For Bullion,"After April consumer price inflation came in lower-than-expected on Wednesday, gold prices softened but continued to remain above the crucial $2,000 per ounce mark. Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, said the fall in the prices of yellow metal could be attributed to market participants realizing there needs to be much more improvement in inflation numbers for the central bank to change its path. Also Read: How To Invest In Gold #Gold sold off as investors realized that the “good” news on #inflation is actually bad, as far more improvement [sic] would be needed to get the #Fed to officially pivot. But persistent inflation is actually very bullish for gold. When investors finally figure that out gold will soar, Schiff said in his tweet. Spot gold was trading at about $2,045 per ounce level on Wednesday but declined after the inflation report. It was trading near $2,032 per ounce during Thursday afternoon’s Asian trading session. Schiff also argued that April inflation numbers should not excite anyone given the fact that the 4.9% figure is still well above the central bank's 2% target. Expert Take: Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA told Reuters there’s still a risk the Federal Reserve will have to keep rates higher for longer. Gold is going to need more rate cuts to become aggressively priced in for it to continue its rally,” he said. This is because if interest rates in the U.S. come down, the dollar will soften and a weakened greenback tends to push gold prices higher.

More retail investors have voted for Bitcoin compared to the dollar as a safe haven choice but professional investors appear to be equally divided in their opinion on the assets, according to Bloomberg's latest Markets Live Pulse survey. Also Read: How to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) Although Bitcoin has fallen close to 10% in the last month, the cryptocurrency is still up over 64% since the beginning of the year. The asset's selection as a safe haven could be a result of investor pessimism as Washington's ability to sort out political stand-offs on the debt ceiling crisis seems to have dipped with the impasse entering the third week of May. It is noteworthy that June 1st is the X-date when the Treasury Department is expected to run out of cash if the debt limit is either not raised or suspended. Interestingly, about 60% of the survey respondents believe the risks are bigger this time as compared to 2011 which witnessed the worst debt-limit crisis of the past, the report said. In the latest development, President Joe Biden said he expects to meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday for talks on the debt ceiling crisis. The President was earlier set to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and senior Congressional leaders on Friday but the meeting was postponed. Gold: More than half of finance professionals surveyed said gold is what they would buy if the U.S. does not honor its obligations, according to the report. However, relying on the asset as a safe haven in current times won't be cheap as the yellow metal is currently trading over the $2,000 per ounce mark compared to the lows of about $1,635 per ounce seen in November last year.

Also Read: How To Invest In Gold The author, however, did not elaborate on the specifics when he talked about corruption and incompetence. Hard Landing: However, the questions he raised about hard landing could potentially be indicating his expectations about the economy and the Federal Reserve's policy path in the wake of high inflation. There are varied opinions on the same among investors. While a section of Wall Street strongly believes there could be rate cuts down the year, some believe the central bank is not yet done raising rates given that inflation is still way higher than its 2% target. For instance, Johanna Chua, chief APAC economist at Citigroup Global Markets, reportedly said inflation is likely to be quite persistent and the Fed may go for two more rate hikes in coming times. At the same time, JPMorgan Asset Management is of the view that a recession in the U.S. is a virtual certainty and the central bank is likely to cut interest rates by the third quarter as growth fizzles out. Price Action: Indeed, as Kiyosaki points out, gold is a good inflation hedge. The commodity has made a significant rally over the last few months as high inflation made investors divert funds from risky assets to the safe haven metal. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have gained over 6% since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin, too, has registered solid returns this year, gaining over 61% on a year-to-date basis, according to Benzinga Pro.

It's pretty clear that we have the look of soon to be at the front end of a recession, Gundlach said during a DoubleLine investor webcast, according to a CNBC report. He added that indicators including ISM new orders and the purchasing managers' index appeared to be signaling a downturn. Also Read: How to Invest in Startups The famed investor and bond expert pointed out that ISM supplier delivery delays are near their lowest levels in 30 years, showing greater supply than demand, which further shows signs of a weak economy. He also highlighted the inversion of 2-year and 10-year Treasury note yields, where shorter-dated bills yield more than longer-dated ones, indicative of the chances of a recession. Gundlach's take stands in contrast to Goldman Sachs' prediction about the economy. The investment bank has revised its estimate about the U.S.' chance of entering a recession over the next 12 months, reducing its judging probability from 35% to 25%. On Fed: Gundlach's comments come at a time when market participants are keenly awaiting the Federal Reserve meeting outcome next week along with the release of the inflation data. We're at very low unemployment. That is what is keeping the Fed on the snugger side, he said. Goldman Sachs has factored in a further 25-basis-point rise, expected to take effect in July.

During Monday afternoon’s Asian trading session, spot gold traded 0.2% higher at $1,925 per ounce. The weakening of the dollar also contributed to the bullish sentiment in gold. However, the upside potential for the commodity remained limited as Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin abruptly halted his advance toward Moscow.

Additionally, higher-than-expected inflation and a surprise 50 basis points rate hike by the Bank of England have unsettled investors, leading them to consider the possibility of prolonged rate increases in the United States. Ole Hansen, Head of Commodity Strategy at Saxo Bank, pointed out that exchange-traded funds have been reducing their gold holdings recently. “Four weeks of ETF selling accelerated last week, when holdings were cut by 17 tons, the most since November, reducing total holdings to a three-month low at 2899 tons.

2023-06-30,Has Gold Lost Safe-Haven Appeal? Portfolio Manager Otavio Costa Says That's 'Backward-Looking And Dismissive' Thinking,"Otavio Costa, a portfolio manager at Crescat Capital, does not agree with the notion that gold has ceased to be a good hedge during bad times and believes the yellow metal is in the early stages of its re-emergence as a safe haven asset. Costa highlighted his disagreement citing a Bloomberg opinion piece by George Mason University professor Tyler Cowen which argued that the yellow metal has become a cyclical asset and is no longer a useful harbinger of social and economic collapse. Also Read: Best Penny Stocks It is completely backward-looking and dismissive of what appears to be the early stages of gold re-emerging as the ultimate haven asset. Given the dire levels of global debt, foreign central banks are compelled to prioritize enhancing the quality of their international reserves to support their monetary systems, Costa said in his tweet. The expert pointed out that central banks function similarly to traditional businesses that require high-quality assets on their balance sheets to establish financial stability. Ultimately, other notable institutions such as pension and endowment funds will likely follow suit. By the end of this decade, conventional 60/40 portfolios will probably become much more balanced with the inclusion of other asset classes like gold, Costa said. Central banks have been increasing their holdings of gold in their reserves in recent times — they added a whopping 1,136 tonnes of the yellow metal to their stockpiles in 2022, which is by far the most of any year in records going back to 1950, said a Reuters report published in February, citing the World Gold Council. Price Action: Spot gold was trading 0.28% lower during Friday’s Asian trade at $1,902 per ounce in the wake of strong U.S. economic data and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell asserting there need to be two more rate hikes to bring inflation under control. Inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go, Powell had said.

Or maybe you’ve been looking at Walt Disney Co’s (NYSE:DIS) stock, down 25% in the last year.

Colas points out that despite the fact that gold has underperformed the S&P 500 in the United States, it has held up better than most global stocks and equities. Colas also points out that demand for gold comes from different sources, including central banks wanting to bolster their balance sheets. Also Read: Is Cathie Wood The Next Warren Buffett?

Colas says that any increase in global geopolitical tensions could help push gold prices even higher. “Now, if you think we're going to have an outbreak of global peace, then gold is probably not a great trade, because central banks will see much less interest and not want to own as much gold,” Colas said in a recent YouTube video and blog post. “However, the current situation feels quite different.
