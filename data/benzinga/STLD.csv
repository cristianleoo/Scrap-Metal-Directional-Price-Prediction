2018-01-11,KeyBanc Issues Stronger Forecast For 3 Steel Names,"The steel sector is looking more attractive than in the past, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The Analyst KeyBanc's Philip Gibbs: Upgraded Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST)'s from Underweight to Sector Weight with no assigned price target, but a $16 fair value price. Maintains an Overweight rating on Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) with a price target boosted from $84 to $95. Maintains an Overweight rating on Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD)'s stock with a price target boosted form $44 to $49. The Thesis U.S. steel demand in 2017 was forecast to have initially grown by 2 percent, but a more accurate figure is 5 percent, Gibbs said in an industrywide research report. (See the analyst's track record here.) Growth came from stronger energy and industrial demand and some implied restocking, Gibbs said. Toward the end of 2017, fourth-quarter shipments were likely stronger than distributors expected, while December shipments were much better than normal seasonality, he said. Given the strong momentum, KeyBanc lifted his 2018 HRC pricing estimate from $615/ton to $655/ton (versus 2017's $623/ton) with strength coming from the energy and industrial sectors, plus alignment in auto inventories, the analyst said. Related Link: This Big US Steel Bear Admits Opportunity For Near-Term Upside TimkenSteel's Upgrade SBQ, or special bar quality, steel represents around 60-65 percent of TimkenSteel's consolidated business and up to 80 percent of its value-added business, Gibbs said. Expectations for 2018 are that the annual SBQ contract price resets will boost the company's FIFO EBITDA from a prior estimate of $93 million to $117 million, he said. TimkenSteel will also see less impact year-over-year from a raw material spread hit and improvements in energy shipments with further upside to the company's annually priced billet arrangement, Gibbs said. Reliance Steel & Aluminum's New Demand Baseline Gibbs turned incrementally bullish on Reliance Steel & Aluminum due to higher than previously expected volumes in the fourth quarter, which he said creates a new demand baseline for 2018. The company will benefit from higher carbon and aluminum pricing expectations and an 80-cents-per-share benefit from tax reform. Incrementally Bullish On Steel Dynamics Gibbs' 2018 earnings per share estimate for Steel Dynamics moved higher from $2.67 to $3.50 due to higher sheet volumes and spreads along with stronger beam spreads, he said. The analyst's revision doesn't assume normalization in CRC-to-HRC spreads. At around $46 per share, Steel Dynamics' stock trades at an 8x EV/EBITDA valuation on 2018 estimates, in the middle of the stock's historic normalized range of 6x to 9x, the analyst said. A $49 price target implies an 8.5x multiple, which is justified given the company's industry growth momentum and strong recurring FCFE yield of around 8 percent, he said.

2018-02-12,KeyBanc Projects 17% Upside In Timkensteel Corp. Shares,"Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST) shares have pulled back about 26 percent since their Jan. 23 high, in contrast to a more modest 8-percent drop by the S&P 500 Index, prompting KeyBanc Capital Markets to upgrade the stock. The Analyst Analyst Philip Gibbs upgraded shares of Timkensteel from Sector Weight from Overweight with a $17 price target, suggesting about 17-percent upside from current levels. The Thesis An attractive valuation after the recent sell-off, modest incremental improvement in industry spot pricing and the emergence of a stronger free cash flow estimate were the drivers of the upgrade, Gibbs said in a Sunday note. The firm's 2018 HRC pricing estimate is now up from $655 per ton to $670 per ton, while the CRC view is maintained at $825 per ton, lowering the HRC-to-CRC spread to $155 per ton compared to $190 per ton in 2017, according to KeyBanc. The spread is now easing closer to the trailing 10-year average of $120 per ton, Gibbs said. The normalization is a function of positive HRC standard deviation and less relative tightness in downstream products amid new capacity and import persistence, the analyst said. We believe spot HRC mill spreads will grow strongly in 2018, while downstream products will be more muted, Gibbs said. KeyBanc modestly increased its estimates for Timkensteel, citing an improving U.S. SBQ, or special bar quality, pricing and mix backdrop. The firm sees Timkensteel and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) to be more affected relative to Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) if the Trump administration's infrastructure narrative becomes dragged or disappoints, Gibbs said. The Price Action Over the past year, Timkensteel shares are down about 13 percent, with a year-to-date drop of about 4 percent.

2018-02-14,"Analyst: Steel Investors Need Action From Trump, Not Words","President Trump on Tuesday said he is considering a number of options for actions he could take to improve the struggling U.S. steel market, including imposing tariffs or quotas on imported steel. Trump said the U.S. steel industry is getting “decimated by dumping” of foreign steel into the market. I look at it two ways: I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry, and we do need that for national defense, Trump said. Trump has ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, the groundwork for him potentially using his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. In January, Trump made a similar decision to implement a 30 percent tariff on imported solar panels. Height Securities said on Wednesday that, despite Trump’s tough language, investors shouldn’t expect immediate action. Height said the potential for negative economic fallout from steel tariffs or alienation of key U.S. allies are two factors holding back the White House from making a move. “We expect that yesterday's meeting was intended primarily as a messaging tool by the White House and that the President's remarks, much like his threat of a ‘reciprocal tax’ from Monday, represents a return to campaign-style rhetoric rather than a clear indicator of immediate action,” Height said in a note. If Height is correct, the gains in steel stocks on Wednesday morning may be unwarranted, at least at this point: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 2.2 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) up 1.3 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) up 2.5 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) up 0.8 percent.

2018-02-16,"US Steel, Aluminum Stocks Rally After Commerce Dept. Calls For Tariffs","Steel and aluminum stocks moved sharply higher Friday after the U.S. Commerce Department issued a recommendation to President Donald Trump to enact steep tariffs or quotas on foreign companies. What You Need To Know Trump's administration looked into the topic of steel and aluminum imports and any potential impact on natural security, CNBC reported. Steel imports are weakening our internal economy and pose a threat to national security, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a Friday letter. Ross recommends the White House take immediate action by adjusting the level of imports through quotas or tariffs. Why It's Important The report calls for a global tariff of 24 percent on all steel imports, with another option calling for a tariff of at least 53 percent on steel coming from a dozen countries including Brazil and China, CNBC said. Ross recommended a 63-percent quota of the countries' 2017 imports. The report also calls for a 7.7-percent tariff on all imported aluminum for most countries, but a higher rate of 23.5 percent on aluminum products from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam. A higher quota of 86.7 percent was recommended in the aluminum report. What's Next? The White House would be able to exempt certain countries from a tariff or quota, and individual companies can seek an appeal if they have any U.S. production facilities. U.S. steel producers should be able to operate at 80-percent average capacity utilization rates or better based on the available capacity that existed in 2017 if action is taken against foreign companies, Ross said. Stock Reactions AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) gained more than 12 percent. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) gained more than 10 percent and hit a new 52-week high of $43.97. Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ:CENX) gained 8 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) gained 4 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) gained 4 percent. Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) gained 0.6 percent.

2018-02-20,Analysts Break Down The Sec. 232 Steel Investigation,"U.S. steel stocks are surging after the U.S. Commerce Department recommended that President Donald Trump enact a 24-percent tariff on all steel imports. Trump had ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, laying the groundwork for him to potentially use his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. The Commerce Dept. laid out three possible courses of action for the president: A blanket 24-percent tariff on all countries. A 50-percent tariff on the 12 largest U.S. importers and a quota equal to 100 percent of 2017 imports on all other countries. No tariff and a quota of 63 percent of 2017 imports on all countries. Investors clearly see the announcement as good news for domestic steel stocks. Here’s what analysts had to say. Voices From The Street Trump will likely opt for a tariff-and-quota scenario, said Morgan Stanley analyst Piyush Sood. “We think that the tariff-plus-quota scenario, with [a] 53-percent tariff against [the] selected 12 countries and [a] quota set to 100-percent (of 2017 import levels) is most likely to be adopted, the analyst said in a Monday note. Citigroup analyst Alexander Hacking said any of the three potential proposals the Commerce Dept. suggested would generate a significant tailwind for the domestic steel industry. “Prices would rise sharply, likely $150/ton, with [the] potential for shortages in the quota-limit scenarios,” Hacking said. Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen said the potential tariffs will be short-lived and may actually be designed to use as leverage in negotiations with exporting countries. “We still see significant problems with the structure of the Section 232 process and anticipate pushback from the Defense Dept. and other factions within the administration, which may hamper efforts to accelerate this process,” Allen said. Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Terry said quotas would have more immediate impact than tariffs. “Quotas on all countries will likely have the maximum impact as it would immediately support higher domestic utilization,” Terry said. BMO Capital Markets analyst David Gagliano said the major impact of the recommendation is that U.S. steel imports will likely drop. “We believe this will result in higher U.S. production, higher U.S. prices and lower unit costs,” he said. Credit Suisse analyst Curt Woodworth said Trump has plenty of motivation to act at this point. “In our view the president will likely follow through on some of these recommendations, given pressure from steel industry executives and the win it would serve up for his political base,” the analyst said. Price Action Here’s a rundown of how steel stocks are reacting to the news since Friday: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) is up 18.1 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) is up 12.9 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) is up 6.1 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is up 4.4 percent. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) is up 6.8 percent. Related Links: US Steel Shares Drop After Gordon Johnson Issues Sell Rating Analyst: Steel Investors Need Action From Trump, Not Words"
2018-03-01,"Height Securities: Concrete Proposal Unlikely To Emerge From Trump's Tariff Meeting With Steel, Aluminum Execs","President Donald Trump will meet with steel and aluminum executives Thursday, leading some to speculate an import tariff announcement is imminent, according to Reuters. But Height Securities considers a final proposal on rates or quotas unlikely to be released. “We expect that ongoing opposition from foreign partners, Congressional leaders, industry representatives from manufacturing industries and the Defense Department will push any final proposal further into March,” Height analysts said in a Thursday note. “ ... If we do receive any announcement today, it will likely be short on detail and may ignore aluminum altogether, as we understand the DoD has significant concerns with imposing any restrictions on aluminum imports.” More likely: a reiteration of Trump’s commitment to strong action, according to Height. Trump tweeted about the topic Thursday morning: Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2018 Headlines from the meeting are expected to bolster sentiment around the steel industry — but not necessarily around the U.S. economy. RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas said tariff talk should not be considered positive. The imposition of tariffs on steel & aluminum is not just bad policy but the worst form of crony capitalism. This will lead to higher consumer costs on autos & transportation. Why protection for firms that just got large tax cuts? — Joseph Brusuelas (@joebrusuelas) March 1, 2018 Height asserted that no meeting outcomes or policy perspectives are certain, considering the president’s mercurial mindset amid the Mueller investigation, staff turnover and “infighting among his closest advisers.” At the time of publication, U.S. steel stocks were trading higher off the open. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 5.3 percent, AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) 8.3 percent, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) 2 percent and Steel Dynamics, Inc.

2018-03-01,"Trump's Comments On Steel, Aluminum Tariffs Shake The Markets","Steel and aluminum stocks are popping on Thursday while the rest of the market crashes after President Donald Trump said he will be announcing new steel and aluminum tariffs as early as next week. What You Need To Know Trump said Thursday the U.S. will implement a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports, but didn't specify whether the tariffs will be applied to all imports or just imports from specific countries. “People have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,” Trump said. “By people representing up who didn’t have a clue.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 500 points Thursday afternoon, sitting around the 24,500 level at time of publication. The S&P 500 slid about 43 points. Why It’s Important The new metal tariffs are on the high end of what some analysts expected after the U.S. Commerce Department recommended a 24-percent tariff earlier this month. Back in January, Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on imported panels, most of which are coming from Asia. China, which is the largest international U.S. trade partner, is a major importer of both steel and solar panels. Politicians in both the EU and China have already threatened to retaliate against the U.S. if Trump implements import tariffs. The EU has said it's prepared to act “swiftly and appropriately” to restrictive U.S. trade measures by potentially implementing its own restrictions on U.S. exports such as bourbon, cheese, orange juice tomatoes and potatoes. EU officials could also reportedly target iconic American brands, such as Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). China is also reportedly already prepping for a trade war, investigating the possibility of restricting U.S. grain imports. What’s Next Investors will now be watching and waiting for further details on the new tariffs and any indication the market sell-off could soften Trump’s stance. In the meantime, Height Securities said on Thursday the steel tariffs are great news for U.S. steel stocks, potentially providing support for domestic prices and increasing profitability. “It is possible that Trump could use this meeting to confirm his commitment to taking strong action, especially on steel tariffs, and we expect that headlines will be positive for the affected steel companies,” Height said prior to Trump's announcement. Here’s a rundown of how steel and aluminum stocks reacted to the news on Thursday: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 7.6 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) was up 4.2 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) was up 10.9 percent. Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) was up 1.7 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) was up 2.4 percent. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was down 1.0 percent.

2018-03-02,"Trump's Steel Tariffs Are Stronger Than The Market Expected, Says Longbow Analyst","President Donald Trump’s decision to enact a 25-percent tariff on imported steel took the market by surprise Thursday and left analysts scrambling to update their outlook for U.S. steel stocks. The Analyst Longbow Research analyst Chris Olin reiterated Buy ratings for the following four steel stocks and adjusted the price targets as follows: Protectionist policies were already baked into steel stock prices and earnings outlooks, but Trump’s decision to opt for a 25-percent tariff was more aggressive than the market was anticipating, Olin said in a Friday note. Despite a recent run-up in steel stocks, the latest news leaves room for further upside, the analyst said. “We still expect steel mills to benefit from rapid upward spot price movement throughout 2018 with a higher-than-expected floor in 2019,” Olin said. As a result, he said Wall Street earnings estimates will need to be adjusted much higher in the coming days. Longbow is valuing U.S. steel stocks using a long-term HRC price range of between $750 and $775/ton. However, Olin expects prices to range between $850 and $875 per ton by the second quarter. Olin made the following adjustments to his 2019 EPS projections: Nucor raised from $1.75 to $7.33. Steel Dynamics raised from $1.03 to $5. U.S. Steel raised from $2.15 to $7.27. AK Steel raised from 24 cents to $1.25. Price Action The prices of all four steel stocks surged between 3 and 10 percent Thursday following Trump’s announcement. The stocks are now up between 15 and 54 percent in the past three months.

2018-03-09,"After Trump's Announcement Of Steel, Aluminum Tariffs, The Sell-Side Reacts","President Donald Trump unveiled plans for steel and aluminum tariffs Thursday, and several Wall Street analysts weighed in on what the tariffs could mean for the market. Voices From The Street The tariffs are good news for steel and aluminum stocks, while the exemptions will ease broader market fears, Cowen analyst Novid Rassouli said in a note. “We think that the steel group could see material upside given that spot steel prices will move higher, in our view, and the stocks are trading at a discount to current spot prices,” Rassouli said. Cowen has Outperform ratings on Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST). JPMorgan analyst Michael Gambardella said he is doubling down on his bullish call for steel stocks. “Following yesterday’s announcement from President Trump, we continue to believe that the 232 case and the tone that has been set by the administration on steel imports will help to create a much more constructive environment for domestic steel prices by improving the supply situation in the U.S.,” the analyst said. JPMorgan has upgraded Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) from Neutral to Overweight and maintains an Overweight rating on United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Height Capital Markets analyst Clayton Allen said AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS), U.S. Steel, Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ:CENX) and Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) face negative market sentiment following exemptions for Mexico and Canada. “Expectations from the steel and aluminum industries were high headed into yesterday's announcement, and Trump's late-stage decision to offer specific exemptions to both Canada and Mexico and possible exemptions to other allies meant the final tariffs failed to meet them,” Allen said. Mexico and Canada are two of the five largest U.S. steel importers flooding the market with supply, he said. Price Action Here’s how key aluminum and steel stocks traded following the tariff announcement Thursday: AK Steel is down 8.2 percent. Alcoa is down 1.1 percent. Century Aluminum is down 9.4 percent. U.S. Steel is down 6.8 percent. Commercial Metals is down 2.8 percent. TimkenSteel is down 1.3 percent. Steel Dynamics is down 3.4 percent.

2018-03-20,Goldman Sachs Initiates On A Slew Of Metal and Mining Stocks,"Goldman Sachs initiated bullish coverage on the metals and mining space, but the firm said investors still need to be selective about which stocks to buy. The Analyst Goldman analyst Matthew Korn set the following ratings and price targets for metals and mining stocks: Initiated Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) with a Buy rating and $23 target. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) with a Buy rating and $78 target. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) with a Buy rating and $59 target. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) with a Buy rating and $42 target. Constellium NV (NYSE:CSTM) with a Buy rating and $16 target. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) with a Sell rating and $25 target. Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI) with a Sell rating and $26 target. The Thesis Overall fundamentals in the North American mining and metals markets are very strong, Korn said. “Commodity prices are high, the supply side for metals and bulks looks more rational than it has been in years, M&M balance sheets are healthy (or at least healthier), and consumption has momentum from coordinated global growth, even as China gradually slows,” Korn said in the note. Korn said copper is the most attractive metal for Goldman at the moment, and Feeport McMoRan has the most copper exposure of the names mentioned. In addition, Korn said U.S. steel mills are expanding capacity with the support of new trade policy and aluminum demand is strong driven by a booming transportation industry. Price Action Here’s a look at how the stocks now covered by Goldman were following the initiation Tuesday: Freeport McMoRan was up 2.1 percent. Nucor was up 0.6 percent. Steel Dynamics was up 0.2 percent. Schnitzer was up 1.3 percent. Constellium was up 1.9 percent. Commercial Metals was down 0.4 percent. Allegheny Technologies was down 1.2 percent.

2018-06-14,KeyBanc Urges 'Selective Bias' On Carbon Steel Stocks,"Investors should continue holding a selective bias on carbon and steel stocks despite an increase in 2018 and 2019 hot rolled coil steel, or HRC, estimates, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The Analyst KeyBanc's Philip Gibbs downgraded Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) from Overweight to Sector Weight with no assigned price target. The analyst maintained an Overweight on Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) with a price target lifted from $97 to $100. The Thesis An analysis of the commodities sector that included surveys with C-level carbon sheet product distributors led KeyBanc to lift its 2018 HRC pricing estimate from $750/ton to $800/ton. The firm also lifted its 2019 HRC pricing estimate from $660 to $675, which on a dollar basis is a smaller uptick compared to 2018 and reflects the eventual easing of tariff effects, a higher 2019 U.S. sheet supply and stronger year-end import supply potential, Gibbs said in a report. The 20 C-level executives surveyed by KeyBanc reported above-average seasonal shipment and volume momentum in the second quarter with strength across all markets, especially construction, industrial and energy, the analyst said. The survey also found a modest amount of customer hedge buying in the second quarter, in contrast with the first quarter, when nearly 50 percent of respondents pointed to some customer hedge buying. Despite what appear to be encouraging industrywide fundamentals, investors need to be selective in their carbon steel equities for valuation reasons, Gibbs said. Many names in the group are modeled to report stellar near-term results due to tariffs, but face the potential for tougher 2019 year-over-year EPS comparisons, he said. Related Link: Analyst: For US Steel, Tariffs Are A Sell-The-News Event Aggressive On Reliance Steel, Not Steel Dynamics Among the entire sector, investors should prioritize free cash flow-rich companies that are building long-term earnings per share power, like Reliance Steel, Gibbs said. The stock boasts exposure to potential infrastructure spending projects; unpredictable, M&A activity; and has a higher return on invested capital due to tax reform, the analyst said. Steel Dynamics' stock has gained around 30 percent since mid-October, and the valuation of 6.5x and 8.6x EV/EBITDA on 2018 and 2019 estimates implies minimal upside potential, Gibbs said. Expectations for excessive profitability in the second and third quarter will normalize into 2019 amid a sheet supply-side recovery, he said. Price Action Steel Dynamics shares were trading down 0.14 percent off the open Thursday, while Reliance Steel shares were trading nearly flat.

2018-06-19,"BofA Downgrades Commercial Metals On Supply, Valuation Concerns","Since hitting a low of $19.65 on April 5, shares of Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) have gained about 23 percent, prompting Bank of America Merrill Lynch to revisit its rating on the equity. The Analyst Analyst Timna Tanners downgraded Commercial Metals from Neutral to Underperform and lowered the price target from $24 to $23. The Thesis Commercial Metals' valuation already reflects its much better-than-normal earnings power and its proposed plan to acquire four Gerdau U.S. rebar mills that's scheduled to close by the end of the year, Tanners said in a Tuesday note. (See the analyst's track record here.) On the downside, the analyst projects potential antitrust challenges to the Gerdau deal due to excess concentration, as imports now face a 25-percent Section 232 tariff, Tanners said. Taking into account the weakness of the Turkish lira — which is down 24 percent year-to-date — the price of imported rebar has dropped, resulting in a $125/ton discount to U.S. prices even after tariffs were applied, the analyst said. BofA expects U.S. rebar imports to rebound in Q4 after a summer dip, along with additional volume from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). The U.S. rebar market was oversupplied before the Trump administration's tariffs, Tanners said. Utilization remains below 80 percent, indicating limited pricing power, the analyst said. In recent midquarter updates on peers NUE and STLD we revisit valuation to use 'normal' multiples on conservative benchmark hot rolled coil and still find upside. BofA prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics to Commercial Metals. The Price Action Commercial Metals shares were down 3.86 percent at $23.15 at the time of publication Tuesday afternoon.

2018-08-27,"Wedbush Double Downgrades AK Steel, Makes Bullish Turn On 2 Rivals","Investors may want to reposition their steel holdings, as prices have dropped 4 percent since their mid-July peak, according to Morgan Stanley. The Analyst Morgan Stanley's Piyush Sood made the following rating and price target changes: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) from Overweight to Underweight, price target from $44 to $30. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) from Equal-weight to Overweight, price target from $6 to $5.50. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) from Equal-weight to Overweight, price target from $50 to $52. The Thesis Steel stocks haven't fully capitalized on the run-up in steel prices through July, and now that prices are falling due to seasonality and capacity restarts, any potential tailwinds from pricing have passed, Sood said in an industrywide report. (See the analyst's track record here.) The benefits from Section 232 tariffs are likely to only last until mid-2019, which suggests that now is the time for investors to become defensive, as cheap stocks can become even cheaper in the near-term, the analyst said. Given the recent changes in sentiment, Morgan Stanley's 2019 HRC price forecast of $760/t and 2020's forecast of $655/t remain unchanged but stocks should now be valued on a base year of 2020, which is a defensible mid-cycle year, Sood said. US Steel Double Downgrade Morgan Stanley's expectations for US Steel heading into Monday's downgrade were for higher 2019 prices and a sharp decline in 2020 due to the costs associated with continued asset revitalization, Sood said. While 2021 and beyond should see improvements at the company level, investors are unlikely to be willing to invest in a steel company today based on catalysts that are so far out at the top of the price cycle, he said. US Steel's cost levels throughout 2018 are higher than previously expected, and consensus estimates for $1 billion in 2019 capex are likely short by $200 million, the analyst said. The company's ongoing maintenance work in asset revitalization could in fact lead to more unparalleled outages, he said. AK Steel: Out Of The Penalty Box AK Steel's stock has been stuck in the penalty box amid poor guidance and concerns over equity issuances, Sood said. Yet the stock has moved lower and investors may want to step up to the buy window for two reasons, the analyst said. The company should benefit from higher pricing for around 25 percent of contract volume — 60-70 percent of total output — in the fourth quarter, with another favorable reset in the first quarter, Sood said. Morgan Stanley forecast that an increase in free cash flow yield from 14 percent in the second quarter to north of 20 percent in 2019 and 2020 should bring down leverage from 3.7 times LTM Net Debt to EBITDA to 1.8 times, which may eliminate any need for future equity issuances. Steel Dynamics: Top Mini-Mill Pick Mini-mill stocks are more defensive in nature than integrated names when steel prices are showing weakness, the analyst said Steel Dynamics boasts a better track record and stability in earnings versus its mini-mill peers, and its conservative management style and reputation of buying low-performance assets to turn them around implies a better likelihood of value creation for investors, he said. Price Action US Steel shares were trading lower by more than 1 percent at the time of publication Monday, while AK Steel was up 3.15 percent higher and Steel Dynamics was 2.49 percent higher.

2018-10-11,Seaport Global Says The Steel Industry Is Due For A Bounce,"Steel stocks have been in focus in 2018 after the steel industry was one of the first to be dragged into the global trade war. Steel stocks have run out of steam in recent months, but one analyst says the steel industry is due for a bounce. The Analyst On Thursday, Seaport Global analyst Derek Hernandez initiated coverage of the following five steel stocks: Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) - Buy rating, $75 price target. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) - Buy rating, $55 price target. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) - Buy rating, $35 price target. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) - Neutral rating, $5 price target. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) - Neutral rating, $20 price target. The Thesis U.S. policy uncertainty and recent declines in forward steel pricing have outweighed the bullish outlook for long-term global steel demand as of late. “Despite elevated earnings in 2018, valuations have pulled back significantly in recent months as doubt and insecurity have followed the year’s early exuberance. We view this pullback as an opportunity to buy market leaders,” Hernandez wrote in the note. Hernandez expects the Trump administration to continue to support the U.S. steel industry via Section 232 tariffs through at least 2020, despite investor concerns that an end to the Section 232 tariffs are always only a tweet away. While Hernandez says the steel tariffs are certainly on the table as a trade war bargaining chip, Trump would likely replace the tariffs with quotas in the event he agrees to drop them. While Hernandez is bullish on the U.S. steel space overall, he said Nucor is his top stock pick given its strong balance sheet, organic growth initiatives and potential for acquisitions.

2018-10-15,"Credit Suisse Downgrades American Steel Sector On Supply, Interest Rate Concerns","The volatile steel sector has yet to obtain the stamp of approval from sell-side firms despite expectations that President Donald Trump's tariffs could lend support. Ahead of the third-quarter reporting season, Credit Suisse downgraded the U.S. steel sector from Overweight to Market Weight. The Analyst Analyst Curt Woodworth has the following ratings and price targets for some of the steel and mining stocks in Credit Suisse's coverage universe: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X): Maintained Outperform/price target reduced from $48 to $40. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target reduced from $77 to $74. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target reduced from $55 to $51. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target increased from $11 to $13. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS): Maintained Outperform/price target increased from $6 to $7. The Thesis Increasing supply into the sheet market and concerns over rising interest rates that are hurting demand are the twin reasons behind Credit Suisse's downgrade of the steel sector, Woodworth said in a Monday note. (See his track record here.) Even as additional capacity is expected to come online from U.S. Steel, ArcelorMittal SA (NYSE:MT) and others, domestic steel production recently hit a four-year high, the analyst said, citing AISI data. Production rates are up by an annualized 6 metric tons, he said. At the same time, HRC prices continued to slide, Woodworth said. Credit Suisse also sees risks stemming from a potential rollback of tariffs due to the likelihood of the U.S. and Canada's NAFTA deal winning approval in early 2019. Electric arc furnace capacity expansions are expected to flood the market by 2020-21, according to Credit Suisse. The firm also expects downstream rolling capacity to ramp up in 2019-20. Capital allocation by steel companies has disappointed relative to investors' wish lists, Woodworth said. The analyst noted a surge in capex in 2018 — with the possibility of more to come in 2019 — and an increase in M&A activity. Although the analyst is in favor of a higher internal rate of return growth spend, he said the companies should have more balanced capital returns. The pace of share buybacks could also disappoint, Woodworth said. These factors could temper investor excitement in the sector, limiting the potential for multiple expansion given the peak margins and cycle fears, the analyst said. Credit Suisse's upbeat stance on U.S. Steel and AK Steel is due to expectations for upside to Street estimates for those companies on the basis of better 2019 contract pricing and more attractive valuations relative to historical forward multiples, Woodworth said. The Price Action The VANECK VECTORS/STL ETF (NYSE:SLX) was up 0.38 percent at $44.37 at the time of publication Monday.

2018-11-27,Steel Stocks Have Wall Street's Attention,"The U.S. steel industry has had a volatile couple of years with fluctuations in steel prices and uncertainty surrounding the fate of steel tariffs in an ongoing trade war. This week, several Wall Street analysts weighed in on steel stocks ahead of the G20 summit of world leaders. New Steel Mill After Monday's market close, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) announced plans to build a new $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion electric-arc-furnace (EAF) carbon sheet steel mill in the U.S. KeyBanc analyst Philip Gibbs said Steel Dynamics investors may have mixed feelings about the new mill. “U.S. carbon sheet-based stocks will likely be weaker tomorrow on the potential for further U.S. supply growth, while STLD investors may be a bit disappointed via potential for less bandwidth to pursue full-out share buyback momentum ($729M left at September's end),” Gibbs wrote in a note. Gibbs said the prospect of more steel supply in the U.S. market will likely weigh on steel prices and maintains a Sector Weight rating for Steel Dynamics stock. Steel Price Forecast On Tuesday, Longbow Research lowered its 2019 HRC steel spot price target by $10 to $15/ton and is now calling for 2019 prices to range between $790 and $795/ton. The new target represents roughly 5 percent downside from 2018 average prices. Despite the bearish adjustment, Longbow analyst Chris Olin reiterated his Buy rating and $40 price target for U.S. Steel (NYSE:X). “We believe the shares are significantly undervalued, even after adjusting for potential market headwinds,” Olin said. Sentiment Falling UBS analyst Andreas Bokkenheuser said net sentiment for the steel group declined in the third quarter. “Average Net Sentiment for all producers remained above global peers (possibly on account of Section 232 support), but directionally still down. We note that Net Sentiment serves as a potential leading indicator for operational performance,” Bokkenheuser wrote in a note. He said U.S. Steel has the highest net sentiment in the quarter, followed by Steel Dynamics, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS). UBS has the following ratings and price targets for the U.S. steel group: Nucor: Neutral, $63 target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral, $48 target. U.S. Steel: Sell, $28 target. AK Steel: Sell, $3.25 target.

2018-12-03,"Insider Buys Of The Week: Macquarie, Steel Dynamics, Sotheby's","Insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. A couple of notable insider buys last week came from CEOs. Shares of two of these companies have been trading near 52-week lows. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10 percent owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly during periods of uncertainty. Here's a look at a few notable insider purchases reported in the past week. Macquarie Infrastructure Macquarie Infrastructure Corp (NYSE:MIC) saw its chief executive officer, Christopher Frost, add to his stake this past week. At a per-share price of $39.73, the 25,160 shares reportedly acquired, via a trust, cost around $999,600. Note that a director purchased 12,000 shares earlier in the month as well. Higher costs associated with acquisitions were in part to blame for the disappointing most recent quarterly report. But the stock ended last week at $41.70 per share, so Frost's latest purchase seems well timed. Shares traded as high as $67.84 in the past year, but the 52-week low is $36.20 and the consensus price target is $49.17. See Also: Insider Response To Tech's Volatile Autumn Steel Dynamics One Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) director made a notable share purchase this past week. At $33.85 apiece, the 20,000 shares acquired cost him about $677,000. His stake was listed as more than 5.0 million shares, compared with approximately 236 million of them listed as outstanding. Steel Dynamics has announced plans to build a new electric-arc-furnace carbon sheet steel mill in the United States for up to $1.8 billion. Still, shares sank to a new 52-week low of $33.38. They ended Friday at $35.20, which is around 6 percent lower in the past week, compared to a 3 percent or so gain the S&P 500. The consensus price target on the shares is $51.71. Sotheby's President and CEO Thomas Smith Jr. of Sothebys (NYSE:BID) also stepped up to the buy window this past week. He picked up 15,250 shares at between $40.73 and $41.11 apiece. That cost him more than $624,600. Smith reportedly made a gift of 15,250 shares and then purchased the same number of shares so as to retain his prior level of investment. This New York-based auctioneer posted better-than-expected quarterly results at the beginning of the month. But the stock was trading at $39.99 a share on last look, lower than the above purchase price range but more than the recent 52-week low of $37.66. The stock has traded as high as $60.16 in the past year. Analysts have a consensus price target of $55.20."

2019-01-28,"Morgan Stanley Upgrades US Steel, Sees Near-Term Bounce In Steel Prices","Steel stocks have taken a beating in the past year, but one Wall Street analyst said Monday a seasonal ramp in U.S. steel demand should help boost prices in the near-term. The Analyst Morgan Stanley analyst Piyush Sood made the following changes to his steel coverage: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) downgraded from Overweight to Equal-Weight, price target cut from $5 to $3. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) upgraded from Underweight to Equal-Weight, price target cut from $30 to $21. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $10.50 to $10. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $26 to $21. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $73 to $62. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) reiterated at Underweight, price target cut from $26 to $22. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Overweight, price target cut from $52 to $42. The Thesis Market dynamics should stabilize steel prices and most steel stocks in the first half of 2019, Sood said. However, he wouldn’t be surprised to see downward pressure on steel prices resume in the second half of the year. “As tariffs are eased further in 2019 and supply/imports increase, steel prices will once again come under pressure, beginning in 2H19,” Sood wrote in a note. He said buyers have mostly stayed on the sidelines in recent in anticipation of lower prices down the road. That dynamic drove hot rolled coil steel prices down from a peak of $920/t in summer 2018 to recent levels of between $640/t and $690/t. Morgan Stanley forecasts late Q1 and Q2 HRC prices of around $700/t driven in part by China stimulus demand. In the longer term, the firm is forecasting 2020 and 2021 HRC prices of $660/t and $640/t, respectively. Price Action Here’s how the steel stocks mentioned reacted to the new commentary Monday: U.S. Steel was down 0.1 percent. Steel Dynamics was down 0.4 percent. Schnitzer Steel was down 2.4 percent. Nucor was down 1.2 percent. Commercial Metals was down 1.1 percent. Cleveland Cliffs was down 1.9 percent. A.K. Steel was down 6.4 percent.

2019-04-11,Bank Of America Gives US Steel A Double Downgrade As Steel Prices Soften,"U.S. steel pricing is not where analysts had anticipated this spring, and one analyst says lower steel prices are bad news for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). The Analyst Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners downgraded U.S. Steel from Buy to Underperform and cut her price target from $31 to $18. The Thesis Steel prices typically peak during the spring season, but Bank of America’s latest pricing checks indicate hot rolled coil prices recently hit their lows for the year. Despite higher international iron ore prices, scrap prices dropped $25/t in April from March levels. Tanners says without a solid pricing environment, it will be very difficult for U.S. Steel to gain any traction in the market. “Our X downgrade reflects a view that without a near-term pricing catalyst, shares face headwinds from anticipated cash burn of $150-200M for 2019E-2021E amid elevated capex needs,” Tanners wrote in a note. U.S. steel typically prices between $50 and $100/t above landed import prices, but mills have recently been pricing sheets at or below import prices. After meeting with steel buyers, Tanners said U.S. mills are competing for market share by oversupplying the market and driving prices down. Bank of America cut its 2019 HRC price estimate from $730/t to $699/t, including a price forecast of $710/t in the second quarter. Tanners says given the difficult environment, she much prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD) over U.S. Steel given their near-term cash flow outlook. Price Action Following the downgrade and additional downgrade from Credit Suisse on Tuesday, U.S. Steel shares are down 15.8 percent on the week. The stock traded around $16.80 at time of publication.

2019-05-17,"Reports: US Set To Drop Steel And Aluminum Tariffs On Mexico, Canada","The United States is planning to lift steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada, clearing the way for ratification of the so-called United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, the replacement for NAFTA, according to a Bloomberg report. The industry reacted to the report with stocks spiking higher for several U.S. steel and aluminum producers. What To Know Bloomberg cited unnamed sources as saying the tariffs will be dropped, with federal officials instead taking a stronger stance on enforcement, opening the door to ratification of USMCA. According to the report, officials are still trying to work out a key issue of an effective date for removing the tariffs.

2019-05-31,Bank Of America Double Downgrades Nucor Ahead Of 'Steelmageddon',"On May 14, U.S. President Donald Trump credited hit tariffs on imported steel with rebuilding the U.S. steel industry, which he said is now “booming.” However, shares of North Carolina steel producer Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) are down 25.9 percent in the past year, and one analyst double downgraded the stock on Friday. The Analyst Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners downgraded Nucor from Buy to Underperform and lowered her price target from $68 to $50. Tanners also made the following price target changes to steel stocks under her coverage: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $1 to $1. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $18 to $13. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $98 to $90. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $40 to $30. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $12 to $8. The Thesis Tanners said Nucor will likely be one of the first victims of what she calls a “steelmageddon” supply glut that will persist through 2021. As a result of oversupply concerns, Bank of America cut its 2022 benchmark hot rolled coil steel price forecast from $590/ton to just $475/ton. “Given a worse 2019E price view, risks of peak demand, and a looming supply glut in 2020-2021E, we see limited catalysts for the group and expect little incrementally positive from its June 20 investor day,” Tanners wrote in the note. Tanners said the supply glut will hurt all U.S. steel companies, but Steel Dynamics will be most immune given its attractive valuation, strong balance sheet, and near-term expansion opportunities. Price Action Nucor shares traded lower by 2.7 percent to $47.94 on Friday.

2019-06-04,Goldman Sachs Downgrades US Steel To Sell,"For the second time in a week, a Wall Street analyst has downgraded a major U.S. steel stock. This time, it’s United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) on the chopping block. The Analyst Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Korn downgraded U.S. Steel from Neutral to Sell and lowered his price target from $17 to $11. Korn also made the following adjustments to his steel price targets: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) reiterated at Sell, target dropped from $2.25 to $1.50. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $96 to $93. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $44 to $36. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $70 to $59. Stelco Holdings Inc (OTC:STZHF) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from C$18 TO C$17. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $27 to $25. The Thesis Less than a week after Bank of America downgraded Nucor, Korn said Tuesday weakening demand and plentiful supply are creating a drag on steel prices that will weigh on the steel stock group. “Weakening demand crossed with stubbornly high output from domestic mills has dragged steel sheet prices down to their lowest levels since 2016, and recent moves by the Trump Administration to weaken the Section 232 tariffs have contributed to expectations of ample available supply in the US market,” Korn wrote in a note. For U.S. steel specifically, Korn said lower steel prices will likely lead to additional earnings cuts and could even put pressure on the company’s bloated balance sheet. U.S. Steel recently announced a $1.2 billion investment in its Mon Valley Works facility that is being funded almost entirely by new debt. Korn is projecting $1.5 billion per year in capex for U.S. Steel from 2019 through 2021 versus just $645 million per year in operating cash generation. Price Action U.S. Steel shares traded around $12.78 at time of publication.

2019-07-23,"Budget Deal, Earnings Strength From Lockheed, CocaCola, United Technologies Lift Spirits","One thing Wall Street arguably never wants is uncertainty about the U.S. government paying its bills and keeping the lights on in Washington. Some of that worry flickered out on news of a budget deal between the White House and congressional leadership, so that could be helpful as trading gets started today. Meanwhile, the earnings treadmill rolled on Tuesday, getting an early jolt from The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) reporting better-than-expected results. Strong sales of its signature beverage helped things along. KO also raised its revenue forecast, something that might be an even better development than strong earnings because it’s forward-looking and says something positive about the economy. In other earnings news, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) beat expectations and lifted guidance, while Travelers Companies Inc (NYSE:TRV) beat on revenue but missed on earnings per share. UTX shares rose 2% and TRV fell about 1% before the opening bell. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) shares rallied 2% in pre-market trading after the defense company surpassed analyst estimates on top- and bottom-lines and raised its forecasts for both. So far, about 18% of S&P 500 companies have reported Q2 results. Of those, 78.5% have surpassed analyst expectations on the bottom line, while 67% have reported better-than-expected revenues, according to FactSet. Earnings growth is 3.6% so far, but we’re really just getting started. Most analysts expect overall earnings to fall in Q2. Overseas, things looked solid overnight, and might give U.S. markets some traction. Growing hopes for more economic stimulus when the European Central Bank (ECB) meets this week appear to be helping stocks in Europe. There was also some talk about the U.S./China trade situation early this week, with media reporting the chance of face-to-face talks resuming between negotiators. That story goes day-to-day, so maybe consider not getting too up or down about any media reports. Still, people are paying very close attention. Earnings Tide Rolling In Monday felt like the calm before the storm as investors geared up for this week’s flood of earnings reports. The rest of the week’s schedule is hyperbolic. Only a few major firms posted results on Monday, but the list grows as the week continues. Today’s action began with LMT, KO, Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), and Kimberly-Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB), among many others. After the bell today, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) are on the list, followed tomorrow morning by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), and Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT). The market could be driven by short-term events, as it often is during earnings season, and the hot sector one day might not be so hot the next. If you’re a long-term investor, it could be prudent not to get too caught up in the day-to-day noise. Some of the trends to consider watching as earnings continue include not just whether companies beat Wall Street’s expectations, but also the quality of their earnings and what executives say about the coming quarters. It’s a judgment call when it comes to “quality” earnings, but if revenue rises from a year earlier and bottom line growth reflects more than one-time events like a tax benefit, that could be a sign. Expectations among analysts are generally low, so a lot of companies are probably going to beat and get a 9th-place “participation” trophy. If earnings beat but they’re down from a year ago, that’s sometimes a signal that all might not be well despite the headline being positive. It’s important to consider digging a bit deeper at times like these to sound out which companies are truly doing well and which ones only seem to be. Technology Ignited as Week Begins One sector where analysts’ expectations are relatively high is Technology, which has been leading the way all year. That didn’t change Monday, with Technology climbing more than 1% to pace all sectors as many of the chip stocks had a great day. These chip names certainly could be among the hardest hit if the China tariff situation goes south, but even if it does, you could make an argument for the chip sector. We know these products are needed. Gamers, especially, want the fastest chips, so there is demand. Chips appeared to get their latest boost from an analyst upgrade to Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) and a few other names. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2%. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was another beneficiary of an analyst report Monday as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) raised its price target on the stock. AAPL is up 30% year-to-date, and the upgrade was based on what MS called “improving” iPhone and services data points. MS said it sees “multiple catalysts” beyond earnings for AAPL. We’ll have to wait and see, but it looks like strength in AAPL was another factor aiding Technology early in the week. Apple reports next week and its results often have a big impact on the market. Apple is in advanced talks to buy Intel’s smartphone modem-chip business, the Wall Street Journal reported, another step in what could be a major push for internal modem development. Treasury yields held pretty much steady early Tuesday, with some analysts wondering how long the 10-year Treasury note can hold above 2%. It’s at just below 2.05% now. As some point out, this week’s ECB meeting is widely expected to result in a rate cut or some other type of stimulus, maybe leading to even more negative rates in Europe when they’re already at all-time lows. U.S. interest rates don’t operate in a vacuum, so even if economic data here look supportive, yields could stay under pressure from overseas developments. There are data this week sprinkled among the dozens of earnings reports, and today brings June existing home sales. New home sales come tomorrow. There’s also the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index this morning, which might get a closer look than normal because of concerns about business confidence. A two-year Treasury note auction is also on today’s calendar. Healthy Consumer in Focus Ironically, the dollar is rising lately despite the looming chance of a rate cut next week. There wasn’t a big move Monday, but the Dollar Index is back near 97.3 after falling well under 97 earlier this summer. This could be a reflection of solid U.S. jobs and retail sales data last month, both of which pointed to potential economic strength. Early results from earnings also seemed to show a healthy U.S. consumer, which isn’t too surprising when you consider how low borrowing costs are and the fact that we’re arguably near full employment. Geopolitics retreated a bit early in the week, but that doesn’t mean they can’t jump right back in the way they did last Friday. The Iran situation is still fluid, but the lack of a major rally in crude probably speaks to how the world is less dependent on Persian Gulf oil than it used to be, media reports reminded us. That said, U.S. crude production could start easing back a little as producers have been reducing the number of active rigs for some time. Crude prices gave back some ground early Tuesday after some initial gains.

Gear Up for Boeing Tomorrow: Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) will likely be front and center tomorrow morning as investors gear up for the latest update on the troubled 737 MAX. One thing to consider is that this isn’t just the story of one company. The grounding of the MAX has far-reaching implications. Let’s not forget all the other companies that contribute parts that go into a plane. We might not see an impact from the MAX grounding in this week’s Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) report, but it could end up affecting future GDP numbers and have a wider impact on the economy. For BA itself, this is looking like a long road. When a company has smoke—whether it’s a Department of Justice investigation, unusual taxes, or product safety—these stories always seem to take longer than you think to resolve. Look at Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC). They’re three years out from the fake accounts scandal and still getting asked about it on their earnings calls. It still haunts them. Failure to Thrive: While its cousin gold basked in the headlines last week at six-year highs, copper hid behind the scenes, unable to escape the range-bound trading it’s been locked in since mid-May (See Figure 1 above). Copper might not be the shiniest metal on the block, but many investors watch its progress to get a sense of demand for the industrial metal used in so many technology products. Copper stirred some excitement in mid-2018 when moved above $3 a pound for the first time since 2015. It’s been stuck in the mud since then and recently traded at $2.71, well under the 2019 high of just under $3. That’s about where it was back in 2006 before everyone had a smartphone in their pockets made partly from copper. Copper isn’t the only industrial commodity under the weather this year. Natural gas futures fell to their lowest levels since 2016 recently, and crude just hasn’t made much traction above $60 a barrel for U.S. futures. Lumber market action isn’t too solid, either. The bearish takeaway might be that all this points to low industrial demand, but a bullish view would say low prices could make business less costly for companies and maybe spark some growth. Producer prices for industrial commodities have leveled out over the last few months, according to government data. Steel Yourself: Last week and the week before featured company reports from a few less-closely followed firms that provided insight into wider economic demand. Yesterday’s earnings from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) is another one that fits into that mold. The company, with around $12 billion in annual revenue, is one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers in the U.S. Though its earnings are already out, it might be interesting to tune into this morning’s earnings conference call to get a sense of how executives feel about the fundamental environment looking ahead to Q3 and Q4. Sometimes it’s less about the numbers and more about the feeling you get on the conference call.

2019-07-23,Steel Dynamics Analyst Projects Q3 Performance Decline,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reported second-quarter results after the close Monday and announced a new mill site. The earnings call scheduled for Wednesday is likely to focus on recent steel order trends and the company’s capital allocation, including the planned mill investment in Texas, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The Analyst Philip Gibbs commented on Steel Dynamics’ second-quarter print and third-quarter prospects. The Thesis Steel Dynamics reported second-quarter FIFO adjusted EPS at 87 cents, missing KeyBanc’s estimate of 90 cents and the Street's expectation of 89 cents, Gibbs said in a Monday note. (See his track record here.) The company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $366 million, beating KeyBanc’s estimate of $360 million, while FCFE of $276 million fell short of the estimate of $333 million due to changes in net working capital, the analyst said. The results were driven by the steel segment, which delivered higher-than-expected shipments and ASPs, he said. The performance of fabrication, metals recycling and other segments was disappointing, Gibbs said. Steel Dynamics continues to expect strong underlying demand in the U.S. and an easing of customer de-stocking pressures, the analyst said. KeyBanc expects a strong sequential decline in third-quarter results due to lag pricing effects in sheet and lower spreads in SBQ products, although this could be partially offset by an expansion in spreads at raw materials and fabrication, he said. Steel Dynamics’ new greenfield mill site at Sinton, Texas is expected to cost $1.9 billion and begin construction in early 2020, according to KeyBanc; construction should ramp up in mid-2021. Price Action Steel Dynamics shares were trading up 1.05% at $31.87 at the time of publication Tuesday.

2019-07-26,Steel Dynamics To Build $1.9 Billion Mill In South Texas Near Gulf Of Mexico,"Indiana-based Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) announced it will build a $1.9 billion mill in Sinton, Texas, about 25 miles northwest of the Port of Corpus Christi. The site for the new mill is strategically located for the southwestern United States and Mexican markets, the company said in a statement July 23. Steel Dynamics is one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers in the U.S. We have been developing a flat roll steel business strategy for this region and Mexico for several years, said Mark Millett, president and chief executive officer of Steel Dynamics. We believe a majority of the customer base will experience a significant freight savings compared to their current supply-chain configurations. The mill will use electric furnaces to turn scrap metal into sheets and strips of steel for the energy, automotive, construction and appliance industries. The mill project could generate between $113 million to $223 million a year, Steel Dynamics reported in a filing with the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Millet said the new mill site will provide access to several markets where the company believes demand for steel will grow, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and the West Coast. The site already has transport access to railroads and highways, and the Port of Corpus Christi and is less than 200 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. Sinton is a town of around 5,000 people located in a region of Texas known as the Coastal Bend. The Gulf of Mexico is less than 30 miles away. Steel Dynamics said there will be around 600 full-time jobs at the new mill. Workers at the plant could earn up to $80,000, according to the Corpus Christi Regional Economic Development Corp. The new steel mill could be finished and operating by 2020, Millet said. This is a wonderful employer that will have a major positive impact that will be felt throughout the region, said Iain Vasey, president and chief executive officer of the Corpus Christi Regional Economic Development Corp. Fort Wayne, Indiana-based Steel Dynamics currently operates six steel mills, including facilities in Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi and Pennsylvania. Three of Steel Dynamics' mills are located in Pittsburgh. The company employs around 8,000 workers. Image Sourced by Pixabay"

2019-09-04,Bank Of America Cuts Steel Earnings Estimates Across The Board,"Bank of America has cut its forecast for U.S. steel prices and dialed back its earnings expectations for American steel stocks across the board. On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners cut her price target for U.S. hot-rolled coil in the second half of 2019 from $628 per short ton to $572. Tanners also issued the following 2019 EPS cuts for popular U.S. steel stocks: Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) cut from $2.05 to $1.95. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) cut from to $4.65 to $4.60. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) cut from $9.20 to $8.99. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) cut from $3.25 to $3.19. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) cut from 79 cents to 75 cents. “On Q2 calls, mills were constructive on demand improving in H2E, but we see risk of weaker volumes and prices, based on our channel checks and recent macro data,” Tanners wrote in a note. No Major Catalysts Ahead Fortunately, Tanners said steel prices could find some near-term support from planned maintenance outages at major mills in coming months. While lower imports would theoretically boost domestic demand, Tanners said many buyers loaded up on inventory after producers announced price hikes over the summer. She said slowing economic growth in China also runs the risk of flooding the market with excess steel given China increased its production by 10% in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, Tanners remains pessimistic about the steel group given more supply cuts are likely in the cards. Bank of America’s top picks in the group are Neutral-rated Reliance and Steel Dynamics. Benzinga’s Take A Neutral rating is far from a vote of confidence. Buying shares of Reliance or Steel Dynamics at this stage would be akin to buying the best house in a bad neighborhood. Investors may want to consider steering clear of steel until the market shows signs of improvement. Do you agree with this take? Email feedback@benzinga.com with your thoughts.

2019-09-06,BMO: Limited Near-Term Upsides For Steel Dynamics,"While Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) has good long-term prospects, there are limited company-specific catalysts that could lend meaningful upside to shares in the near term, according to BMO Capital Markets. The Analyst BMO’s David Gagliano downgraded Steel Dynamics from Outperform to Market Perform while lowering the price target from $40 to $30. The Thesis Steel Dynamics’ long-term growth prospects seem underappreciated, especially after the company announced plans to construct a greenfield flat-rolled mill in Texas, Gagliano said in the downgrade note. He added, however, that between 2019 and 2022, Steel Dynamics has higher exposure to near-term spot steel pricing volatility. The analyst cited two reasons for this. First, the company’s free cash flow buffer is currently lower than it has been historically, given the planned increase in capital expenditure during 2020-2022. And second, Steel Dynamics has much higher-than-peers near-term EBITDA sensitivity to changes in underlying spot sheet prices. Although Steel Dynamics could generate healthy volume growth in the longer term, there is more downside risk than upside potential to underlying spot prices till the end of 2019, Gagliano said. Price Action Shares of Steel Dynamics had declined more than 1.46% to $27.65 at the time of publishing.

2019-09-16,"Nucor Lowers Q3 Earnings Guidance, Sees 'Softening' In Some Markets","Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) lowered its earnings guidance for the third quarter ending Sept. 28 on Monday and said it expects earnings to be in the range of 75 cents to 80 cents per diluted share. The news sent shares of steel companies trading lower. Nucor's second-quarter earnings were $1.26 per diluted share, and the guidance also represents a year-over-year decrease from earnings of $2.13 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. The performance of the steel mills segment in the third quarter of 2019 is expected to decrease compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower prices for sheet and plate steel. “Although we still see stability in most of the end use markets that we serve, there has been some softening in automotive, agricultural products and power transmission markets,” the company said in a statement. Outlook By Segment Nucor said it expects the profitability of the steel products segment to improve sequentially in the third quarter, as nonresidential construction market conditions remain strong. In addition, recently enacted efficiency initiatives in rebar fabrication and metal buildings are enhancing performance from those businesses, the company said. Nucor said the performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the third quarter due to further margin compression in the company's direct reduced iron businesses. Price Action Nucor shares were trading down 1.06% at the time of publication.

2019-09-18,Steel Dynamic's Q3 Guidance Comes In Worse Than Expected,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) issued third-quarter earnings guidance Tuesday in the range of 66 to 70 cents per diluted share vs. a Street estimate of 71 cents. The company said it expects third-quarter earnings from the company's steel operations to decrease sequentially from the second quarter. Steel Dynamics cited lower profitability from the company's sheet steel operations, as shipments and average steel pricing declined in the quarter, more than offsetting lower scrap costs. The underlying demand for domestic steel remains principally intact for the primary steel-consuming sectors, according to Steel Dynamics, with the construction segment being particularly strong. The company also expects lower third-quarter profits in its metals recycling platform. Earnings from the steel fabrication business are expected to improve sequentially, according to Steel Dynamics. The company continues to experience strong steel fabrication order backlogs and customers remain optimistic concerning non-residential construction projects. Steel Dynamics shares were trading down 1.07% at $30.63 in Wednesday’s premarket session. The stock has a 52-week high of $48.17 and a 52-week low of $25.02.

2019-09-19,US Steel Joins Chorus of Steelmakers Warning Of Q3 Underperformance,"The steel industry's cup of woes overflows, as evidenced by a string of warnings from a few of the biggest players in the sector. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) became the latest to warn of worsening fundamentals when it made a third-quarter pre-announcement late Wednesday. U.S. Steel shares were sinking 13.455 to $10.78 at the time of publication Thursday. Way Off The Mark The steelmaker said in a release it expects third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million, which excluded a $53-million impact from a fire at its Clairton coke making facility and estimated restructuring charges. The Pittsburg-based company now expects an adjusted third-quarter loss of 35 cents per share, notably wider than the 7-cent per share loss estimated by analysts, on average. Brittle Fundamentals After the strength witnessed in the summer, the flat-rolled steel market has softened, U.S. Steel said. The combination of falling steel prices through the second quarter and a bigger-than-expected drop in scrap prices will negatively impact flat-rolled earnings in the second half of the year, according to the company. U.S. Steel now expects full-year flat-rolled shipments to third-party customers to be 10.7 million tons, as it expects to idle two of its U.S. blast furnaces to match supply with demand forecasts. U.S. Steel also warned of a continued deterioration of market conditions in Europe, with the incongruence between steel selling prices and raw material costs pressuring margins. In line with its labor productivity strategy announced earlier, the company has thus far eliminated 1,800 positions of the planned 2,500 cuts planned by the end of 2021. Pressured by high import levels and weakening market conditions, the company's Tubular segment is expected to remain under pressure for the remainder of the year, U.S. Steel said. Not Alone In The Quagmire U.S. Steel's predicament is not company-specific, as two other big giants sounded the alarm in their guidance as well. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) pre-announced a third-quarter shortfall earlier this week, citing weakness in its steel mills and raw materials business. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) said Wednesday it expects third-quarter earnings of 68-70 cents per share, below the 71-cents-per-share consensus estimate, as shipments and average steel pricing of its sheet steel operations declined in the quarter.

2019-09-19,PreMarket Prep Recap: Buybacks Add Fuel To Rally Ahead Of Quadruple Witch Expiration,"At the top of Thursday's PreMarket Prep show, the likelihood of follow-through from the late rally in Wednesday's session was debated. Two factors increasing the chance of that were the overall reaction from the Fed's action, a buyback from Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and a dividend raise and buyback by the S&P 500 index top component Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). From the premarket action, it appeared that Microsoft was more likely to make a new all-time high than Target, which turned out to be the case. Overstock, Steel Sector Guidance And Good News From RH The impact of the former CEO of Overstock.com Inc (NASDAQ:OSTK) dumping all of his shares was discussed. The only major support level that could halt the decline would be its Sept. 3 low of $14.72, Dick said. Off the open, the issue continued lower but found support a few pennies above that low and has rebounded back into the mid-$15 handle. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) followed the lead of Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) in lowering third-quarter guidance, and it was deep in the red in premarket trading. The warnings came at a bad time for investors in the sector, as the issues had distanced themselves from recent lows. On the opposite end of the guidance spectrum was Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc (NYSE:RH), which raised its 2019 guidance just one week after upbeat second-quarter results. Buyers were able to nudge the issue to a new all-time-high, but the stock surrendered all of those gains and has gone red on the session. Chaikin Bullish, Johnson Bearish Once again, Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) made a move during the show. This time it was to the upside, as the company announced a new streaming player line-up. This helped end the slide instigated by Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The two companies announced Wednesday that they were entering the streaming fray. Roku's rally from the premarket session carried over into Thurdsay's regular session, but it has come nowhere near Wednesday's high ($145.75). Surely, investors caught in the issue's massive sell-off are lightening up into the rally. A pair of guests joined the show with differing views of the markets. Marc Chaikin of Chaikin Analytics exuded optimism for the rally to continue, while Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research pointed out several negatives with respect to the U.S. and Chinese economies and a not-so-favorable outlook for the steel. electric vehicle, solar and cannabis sectors. Schwartz Joins Friday's Show On the final show of the week, Jerremy Schwartz, director of research at Wisdom Tree Investments Inc (NASDAQ:WETF), will comment on Fed's recent action, oil and the return of small-cap value.

2019-10-10,US Steel's Stronger-Than-Expected Preliminary Q3 Results Send Sector Higher,"United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) shares were trading higher Thursday after the company reported preliminary third-quarter results that outperformed gloomy guidance issued last month. The company expects a preliminary net loss in the range of $84 to $94 million, or a loss of 49-55 cents per diluted share. U.S. Steel reported a preliminary adjusted net loss of approximately $35 to $45 million, or a loss of 20-26 cents per share. Third-quarter preliminary adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $134 to $144 million. Stronger shipments and better than expected manufacturing performance in our flat-rolled segment, as well as a contingency gain from recovered claims arising out of the bankruptcy of a supplier drove better than expected results, the company said in a statement. The company had said on Sept. 18 it expected third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million and an adjusted third-quarter loss of 35 cents per share.

2020-07-06,What A Biden Victory Could Mean For US Steel Industry,"U.S. steel stocks have had a tough run under President Donald Trump, but Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners says things might not get much better for steel stocks if presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House in November. Biden now has a 20-point lead over Trump, according to the online prediction market PredictIt.org. While steel investors may assume a Democratic victory in November would result in the rollback of Trump’s Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, Tanners said tariffs have historically been a nonpartisan issue. Both sides of the political aisle voiced concerns about Trump’s steel tariffs. While the tariffs seemingly haven’t done much to improve steel prices and margins during the Trump presidency, Tanners said Monday that removal of the tariffs at this point would have a negative impact on prices during a critical period for the industry in which it is overbuilding capacity. Other Political Factors One potential partisan headwind for the steel industry could be the fate of Trump’s border wall with Mexico. Most of the pipe for the proposed border was expected to be delivered by the end of 2020. Tanners said Democrats would likely halt construction of the wall, but whether or not they would tear down and scrap what has already been built could have a major impact on near-term steel prices. Two additional major political catalysts could have a significant impact on the US steel industry, according to Tanners. First, Biden’s plan to raise corporate tax rates from 21% to 28% would hurt steel stocks is Democrats gain control in Washington. However, a clean sweep by Democrats could also improve the chances that an infrastructure spending bill will be passed, a potential positive tailwind for steel demand. How To Play It For now, Tanners said investors should be careful in the U.S. steel space. “Ultimately, a potential Democrat win would add to our already cautious thesis on most U.S. steel names,” Tanners wrote in a note. Bank of America has Underperform ratings on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Bank of America has a $34 target for Nucor, a $23 target for Steel Dynamics and a $3 target for U.S. Steel. Benzinga’s Take At this point, the U.S. steel group is a highly speculative space given the tremendous political risk and uncertainty regarding the election and the potential outlook in 2020 and beyond. Add in the uncertainty created from the COVID-19 outbreak and the trade war with China, and there are simply too many unknowns for investors to have much confidence in steel stocks these days.

2020-12-29,Understanding Steel Dynamics's Ex-Dividend Date,"On November 19, 2020, Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) announced shareholders can expect to receive a dividend payable on January 15, 2021. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Steel Dynamics has an ex-dividend date planned for December 30, 2020. The company's current dividend payout sits at $0.25. That equates to a dividend yield of 2.81% at current price levels. The Significance Of An Ex-Dividend Date Ex-dividend dates signal when company shares cease to trade with their current dividend payouts. There is a small intermission period before companies announce new dividends. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. Steel Dynamics's Dividend History Over the past year, Steel Dynamics has experienced an overall upward trend regarding its dividend payouts and a downward trend regarding its yields. Last year on December 30, 2019 the company's payout was $0.24, which has since grown by $0.01. Steel Dynamics's dividend yield last year was 3.02%, which has since decreased by 0.21%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market.

2021-01-08,Here's How The US Steel Industry Is Getting Greener,"The U.S. steel industry is leading the world in turning its business green. In a note out on Friday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said U.S. steel producers like United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) already produce some of the world’s greenest steel, and their shift to electric arc furnace (EAF) production will reduce their carbon footprints even further. Steel Emissions Targets: EAFs are about 75% more emissions-efficient than traditional blast furnace steel mills, according to Tanners. Today, only 28% of global steel production comes from EAFs. The International Energy Agency has said the global steel industry should aim to boost that percentage to 40% by 2030. Related Link: Cleveland-Cliffs' ArcelorMittal Asset Purchase Could Help Combat 'Steelmageddon' However, the U.S. steel industry is already paving the path to a greener future, on track to produce more than 80% of its total output via EAFs by 2023. In addition to lessening its impact on the planet, Tanners says public steel companies have major financial incentives to go green. “Our equity strategists in early 2020 estimated $20T of asset inflows would be directed into impact investing over the next few decades, with $3T of assets already using climate change in their investment decisions,” she wrote the note. How To Play It: Steel stocks are going green, but Tanners said that doesn’t necessarily mean steel stock investors will be seeing green in the near future given the pricing pressures the industry is facing. Bank of America has the following ratings and price targets for U.S. steel stocks: U.S. Steel: Underperform rating, $8 target. Commercial Metals: Neutral rating, $22 target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral rating, $40 target. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Underperform rating, $45 target. Benzinga’s Take: The best hope for U.S. steel stock investors in the near-term would be an aggressive infrastructure spending plan from the Biden administration. President-elect Joe Biden has floated the idea of a $2 trillion Build Back Better infrastructure plan that could provide a shot in the arm for steel industry demand."

2021-03-31,"3 Steel Stocks Heating Up This Week: US Steel, Steel Dynamics, Nucor Technical Levels","Steel stocks have been heating up this week, with bullish moves in a few tickers. United States Steel Corp. (NYSE:X), Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Nucor Corp. (NASDAQ:NUE) are three steel movers. These stocks may be potential long-term investments. Below is a daily chart analysis for each of the three stocks. US Steel Daily Chart Analysis: The daily chart above shows there are three potentially key levels on the U.S Steel chart. The stock may have broken out of a channel. The stock was previously trading in a channel between the price levels of $20 and $25 before the stock broke above the $25 level. This $25 level needs to hold for the stock to see higher moves. Below the $25 level, the stock may not find support until the $20 level, and below $20 not until $16. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support. Steel Dynamics Daily Chart Analysis: The chart shows the stock has been in an uptrend throughout the last year, which can be shown by connecting the lows with a line. The stock recently broke above $44, an area it struggled to get over in the past. The stock then found support at this level. This is an area the stock may stay above in the future. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support. Nucor Daily Chart Analysis: Nucor stock has taken off over the last week, making new highs. The chart recently broke above resistance of $67.50 and was able to retest it as support. This is an area where the stock may find support again in the future. If the stock were to fall below $67.50, it might not find support again until $57.50. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support."
2021-04-07,Record Steel Prices Create Investment Opportunities For These 4 Stocks,"U.S. hot-rolled coil steel prices recently hit all-time highs of $1,300 per short ton. Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said Wednesday that record prices will generate huge profits for steel mills in the first half of 2021. Heading into first-quarter earnings season, Tanners said investors will be watching closely for indications from management about how steel companies will be spending their excess cash. Excess Cash: Tanners said some companies will obviously use the near-term cash windfall to pay down debt and improve unhealthy balance sheets. However, she said companies with healthy balance sheets, such as Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) and Ternium SA (NYSE:TX), have several options for how to allocate that extra cash. Related Link: Gordon Johnson On 'Perfect Storm For The Steel Mills': Why He's Bullish On US Steel, Cleveland-Cliffs One likely scenario is they will use a significant portion of it to fund working capital growth for downstream operations, Tanner said. She added that management may be hesitant to spend the cash on buybacks given the steel market appears to be at or near a cyclical peak. That same line of reasoning could discourage M&A deals in the near future given the current steel environment is a seller’s market. “While we think M&A could heat up, aided by low interest rates and plentiful cash, we see limited options for mills and likely more downstream processing and bolt-on growth, such as NUE’s recent pipe mill or a new galvanizing or paint line, typically ~$250-300M,” Tanners said. How To Play It: Tanners is projecting steel prices will trend “sharply lower” in the second half of 2021. Bank of America has the following ratings and price targets for the steel stocks mentioned: Nucor: Underperform rating, $56 price target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral rating, price $49 target. Reliance Steel: Buy rating, $167 price target. Ternium: Buy rating, $44 price target. Benzinga’s Take: All four steel stocks mentioned are up at least 45% in the past six months, so the excess cash flow Tanners is expecting in the first half of 2021 may already be priced into the stocks to a large degree. The big question for steel stock investors is when steel prices start to pull back and how deep that pullback will be. (Photo: Ternium)"

Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the consensus estimates; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an earnings surprise, which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Monday, earnings would be up 114.77%. Revenue would be up 31.65% on a year-over-year basis. Steel Dynamics's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q4 2021 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate 0.83 0.47 0.32 0.79 EPS Actual 0.97 0.51 0.47 0.88 Revenue Estimate 2.53 B 2.21 B 2.06 B 2.56 B Revenue Actual 2.60 B 2.33 B 2.09 B 2.58 B Stock Performance Shares of Steel Dynamics were trading at $50.89 as of April 15.

2021-04-20,"BofA Upgrades Steel Dynamics, Nucor Amid Record Steel Prices","U.S. steel prices remain at record highs. One analyst says investors shouldn’t fight the trend and upgraded two steel stocks. The Analyst: Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners upgraded Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD) from Neutral to Buy and raised her price target from $49 to $61. Tanners also upgraded Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) from Underperform to Neutral and raised her price target from $56 to $80. In addition to the upgrades, Tanners reiterated ratings on the following steel stocks: Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS): Buy rating, price target raised from $167 to $182. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC): Underperform rating, price target raised from $24 to $25. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Underperform rating, price target raised from $12 to $14. Related Link: Record Steel Prices Create Investment Opportunities For These 4 Stocks The Thesis: Tanners said the U.S. steel market has bucked multi-decade downward pricing trends and set new record in 2021. Tanners said steel prices will normalize once the industry works through the current patch of temporary undersupply produced by COVID-19 related production disruptions. However, she said the near-term earnings windfall for steel companies as a result of the spike in steel prices could have a positive impact on the balance sheets of the top steel stocks through at least the first three quarters of 2021. “STLD and NUE not only have better balance sheets as a result of this unprecedented steel environment, but in our view are well positioned to continue to dominate and operate capacity even assuming oversupply down the road,” Tanners wrote in the note. She said U.S. Steel will likely get the least benefit from the near-term windfall profits given it needs more than $2 billion in major repairs to existing assets. Benzinga’s Take: Record steel prices may not last, but both Nucor and Steel Dynamics appear to already be pricing in a pullback in steel prices at some point. Nucor shares trade at just 18.8 times forward earnings, while Steel Dynamics has a forward earnings multiple of just 14.9."
2021-04-20,A Look Into Steel Dynamics Debt,"Shares of Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) increased by 32.55% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Steel Dynamics has. Steel Dynamics's Debt Based on Steel Dynamics's financial statement as of March 1, 2021, long-term debt is at $3.02 billion and current debt is at $106.55 million, amounting to $3.12 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.37 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $1.75 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Steel Dynamics has $9.27 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.34. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-04-28,'Unprecedented Steel Bubble': Here's How To Play It,"Record U.S. steel prices have steel stocks soaring, but Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said Wednesday the steel stock party won’t last forever. Tanners recently did a deep dive on past steel price peaks and found a history of sharp drops in steel prices and stocks. History Lesson: So far, Tanners has seen no evidence that U.S. steel prices have reached the current cycle’s peak given new capacity has been delayed until late 2021. Hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel prices recently ranged between $1,400 and $1,500 per ton, more than double their 10-year average of $641. Prior steel price peaks in 2004, 2008, 2016 and 2018 suggest steel stocks will peak roughly a month before steel prices do, suggesting investors should be watching stock prices more closely than steel prices. Related Link: BofA Upgrades Steel Dynamics, Nucor Amid Record Steel Prices How To Play It: Tanners said past steel market corrections have hit higher-levered stocks hardest, which doesn’t bode well for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Instead, she prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), both of which should be able to offset the negative impact of falling steel prices by ramping up capacity. No matter what, Tanners said investors need to understand the risks in the steel space these days. “A cautious and nimble approach is best navigating cyclicals late in the price cycle amid an unprecedented steel bubble, in our opinion,” she wrote in a note. Benzinga’s Take: Record steel prices may not last, but both Nucor and Steel Dynamics appear to already be pricing in a pullback in steel prices at some point. Nucor shares trade at just 17.6 times forward earnings, while Steel Dynamics has a forward earnings multiple of just 13.7."
2021-05-25,Algoma Steel Gets SPAC Deal: What Investors Should Know,"With the price of steel booming, a more than 100-year-old steel manufacturer is going public in a SPAC merger. The SPAC Deal: Algoma Steel is going public in a SPAC merger with Legato Merger Corp (NASDAQ:LEGOU) valuing the company at an enterprise value of $1.7 billion. The deal values Algoma Steel at 1.9x estimated adjusted EBITDA of $901 million. Algoma Steel also plans to list on the Toronto Stock Exchange after the merger is completed.

2021-06-16,Price Over Earnings Overview: Steel Dynamics,"Looking into the current session, Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) is trading at $61.10, after a 3.29% decrease. Over the past month, the stock fell by 1.78%, but over the past year, it actually went up by 128.24%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 8.64%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 16.94 in the Metals & Mining industry, Steel Dynamics Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 16.89. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings."
2021-06-16,Analyst Ratings for Steel Dynamics,"Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) has observed the following analyst ratings within the last quarter: Last 30 Days 1 Month Ago 2 Months Ago 3 Months Ago Bullish 0 0 1 1 Somewhat Bullish 1 1 2 0 Indifferent 0 0 0 0 Somewhat Bearish 0 0 0 0 Bearish 0 0 0 0 7 analysts offering 12-month price targets in the last 3 months for Steel Dynamics evaluate the company at an average price target of $67.71 with a high of $107.00 and a low of $53.00. This current average has increased by 26.32% from the previous average price target of $53.6. What Are Analyst Ratings? Analysts work in banking and financial systems and typically specialize in reporting for stocks or defined sectors. Analysts may attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish analyst ratings for stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter. Analysts may suggest actions like buy, sell, hold, or similar verbage for each stock based on research compiled from the corresponding company. Analysts who suggest buy are telling traders to purchase the stock based on forecasted growth. On the flip side, analysts who suggest sell are telling traders to dump the stock because of a similarly forecasted decline. Analysts who suggest hold are telling investors that they see short-term or mid-term stagnation and to maintain their positions on the stock. Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders."
2021-06-16,The 'Great Steel Squeeze Of 2021' Continues: What's Next?,"The 2021 surge in steel prices has once again prompted Bank of America to raise its earnings outlook for U.S. steel stocks. EPS Adjustments: On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners raised her 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates for steel stocks across the board and is now expecting significant earnings beats from all the steel stocks she covers in 2021. Here’s a rundown of the 2021 EPS changes: Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC), EPS estimate raised from 78 cents to 87 cents. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), EPS estimate raised from $4.40 to $5.38. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS), EPS estimate cut from $4.43 to $4.35. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD), EPS estimate raised from $2.96 to $3.62. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), EPS estimate raised from $2.53 to $2.80. Related Link: 'Unprecedented Steel Bubble': Here's How To Play It Despite the near-term tailwinds in steel prices, Tanners said the current pricing environment is unsustainable and investors should be prepared for the fallout. U.S. benchmark hot rolled coil spot prices recently reached near $1,700 per ton, about 2.5 times higher than their historical level. How To Play It: Tanners is projecting HRC steel prices will fall to an average of $1,075 in the second half of 2021 and all the way back down to $600 in 2022. “Our conviction of falling prices is supported by our Steelmageddon oversupply thesis, which was delayed to 2022E due to 2021’s COVID-inspired supply squeeze and some delayed capacity startups,” Tanners said. The analyst said steel stocks typically correct before steel prices do in past bubbles, making timing the trade very difficult. For now, she said investors need to be selective within the steel group. Her top stock picks include Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF), Reliance and Steel Dynamics. Benzinga’s Take: The VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX) is already up 38.3% year-to-date, so the excess cash flow Tanners is expecting in coming quarters may already be priced into the stocks to a large degree. The big question for steel stock investors is when steel prices start to pull back and how deep that pullback will be."
2021-07-07,Unusual Options Activity Insight: Steel Dynamics,"On Wednesday, shares of Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $61.21. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-07-16 Strike Price: $55.00 Volume: 94 Open Interest: 546 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-07-16,A Preview Of Steel Dynamics's Earnings,"Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) releases its next round of earnings this Monday, July 19. Here is Benzinga's essential guide to Steel Dynamics's Q2 earnings report. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Based on Steel Dynamics management projections, analysts predict EPS of $3.42 on revenue of $4.22 billion. Steel Dynamics EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $0.47. Sales were $2.09 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the consensus estimates. A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an earnings surprise and may move the stock by a considerable margin. If the company were to match the consensus estimate, earnings would be up 627.66%. Revenue would be up 101.53% on a year-over-year basis. In comparison to analyst estimates in the past, here is how the company's reported EPS stacks up: Quarter Q1 2021 Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 EPS Estimate 1.89 0.83 0.47 0.32 EPS Actual 2.10 0.97 0.51 0.47 Revenue Estimate 3.39 B 2.53 B 2.21 B 2.06 B Revenue Actual 3.54 B 2.60 B 2.33 B 2.09 B Stock Performance Shares of Steel Dynamics were trading at $61.62 as of July 15. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 131.27%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably satisfied going into this earnings release.

2021-07-29,Return on Capital Employed Insights for Steel Dynamics,"After pulling data from Benzinga Pro it seems like during Q2, Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) earned $955.74 million, a 60.84% increase from the preceding quarter. Steel Dynamics also posted a total of $4.46 billion in sales, a 25.95% increase since Q1. Steel Dynamics earned $594.20 million, and sales totaled $3.54 billion in Q1. Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Steel Dynamics's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q2, Steel Dynamics posted an ROCE of 0.19%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. For Steel Dynamics, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies. Upcoming Earnings Estimate Steel Dynamics reported Q2 earnings per share at $3.4/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $3.42/share."
2021-08-09,Understanding Steel Dynamics's Unusual Options Activity,"Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) shares experienced unusual options activity on Monday. The stock price moved up to $63.31 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-08-20 Strike Price: $60.00 Volume: 580 Open Interest: 3795 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Why Insider Transactions Are Important? Insider transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however an insider transaction can be an important factor in the investing decision. In legal terms, an insider refers to any shareholder who owns at least 10% of a company. This can include executives in the c-suite and large hedge funds. These insiders are required to let the public know of their transactions via a Form 4 filing, which must be filed within two business days of the transaction. When a company insider makes a new purchase, that is an indication that they expect the stock to rise. Insider sells, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean that the seller thinks the stock will go down. Transaction Codes To Focus On Investors prefer focusing on transactions that take place in the open market, indicated in Table I of the Form 4 filing. A P in Box 3 indicates a purchase, while S indicates a sale. Transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option, and transaction code A indicates the insider may have been forced to sell shares in order to receive compensation that had been promised upon being hired by the company."

2022-01-19,Steel Dynamics: Debt Overview,"Shares of Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) moved lower by 10.90% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Steel Dynamics has. Steel Dynamics's Debt Based on Steel Dynamics's financial statement as of November 2, 2021, long-term debt is at $3.02 billion and current debt is at $88.60 million, amounting to $3.11 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.10 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $2.01 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Steel Dynamics's $11.54 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.27. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2022-01-24,Ominous Death Cross Forms On Steel Dynamics's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Steel Dynamics, which is trading around $51.38 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at Steel Dynamics's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q3 2021 Q2 2021 Q1 2021 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 4.57 3.42 1.89 0.83 EPS Actual 4.96 3.40 2.10 0.97 Revenue Estimate 4.98B 4.22B 3.39B 2.53B Revenue Actual 5.09B 4.46B 3.54B 2.60B Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2022-07-15,Will Strong Demand Drive Steel Dynamics' (STLD) Q2 Earnings?,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD is set to release second-quarter 2022 results after the closing bell on Jul 20. Steel Dynamics' earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 2.5%, on average. The company posted an earnings surprise of 7.9% in the last reported quarter. Its second-quarter results will likely reflect the benefits of strong end-market demand. Shares of the company have gained 7% in the past year compared with 23.9% decline of the industry. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Zacks Model Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Steel Dynamics this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earning beat. Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Steel Dynamics is +8.23%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is currently pegged at $5.68. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Steel Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. What do the Estimates Say? Steel Dynamics envisions second-quarter earnings in the range of $6.33-$6.37 per share, which suggests a record quarterly performance. Adjusted earnings have been forecast in the band of $6.61-$6.65 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Steel Dynamics for the to-be-reported quarter is at $6,066 million, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 35.9%. The consensus estimate for average external product selling price for the company's steel operations is pegged at $1,471 per ton, indicating a year-over-year increase of 13.9%. The same for total external steel shipments stands at around 3.2 million tons, up around 9.7% year over year. A Few Factors to Watch The company's second-quarter results are likely to have benefited from demand strength across key markets. Strong demand across automotive, construction and industrial markets is expected to have aided its performance. Strength in the non-residential construction sector continues as reflected by strong order activities. Strong demand is expected to have driven its shipments in the to-be-reported quarter. Steel Dynamics, last month, said that it sees second-quarter profitability from steel operations to be historically strong but lower than first-quarter 2022 levels. The downside reflects lower earnings from the company's flat roll steel operations, as average flat roll pricing more than offset projected higher shipments. Strong demand for long product steel products supported higher average realized pricing in the quarter. The company witnessed solid overall steel demand during the second quarter, notwithstanding softening hot roll coil steel pricing. U.S. steel prices witnessed a significant downward correction during the second quarter. After surging to nearly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war, the benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices are on a downward trend and have retreated to levels before the conflict. HRC prices have fallen below the $1,000 per short ton level. The downward drift partly reflects shorter lead times. Mills are also negotiating lower prices for new orders. Fears of a recession have also impacted prices. Nevertheless, Steel Dynamics is expected to have benefited from higher year over year average selling prices in the June quarter. The impacts of higher selling prices are likely to reflect on its revenues and margins in the quarter. Steel Dynamics, Inc.

2023-01-27,A Look Into Basic Materials Sector Value Stocks,"What Defines a Value Stock? A value stock traditionally has a lower price when compared to stock prices of companies in the same industry. This indicates that the company may be undervalued, as investors are not expressing as much interest in such companies. The most commonly used way to check for value is with the price-to-earnings multiple, or P/E. A low P/E multiple is a good indication that the stock is undervalued. The following stocks are considered to be notable value stocks in the basic materials sector: Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) - P/E: 5.37 Cemex (NYSE:CX) - P/E: 1.4 Nexa Res (NYSE:NEXA) - P/E: 7.45 Reliance Steel & Aluminum (NYSE:RS) - P/E: 7.45 Huntsman (NYSE:HUN) - P/E: 5.9 Steel Dynamics saw a decrease in earnings per share from 5.46 in Q3 to $4.37 now. Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 1.48%, which has decreased by 0.18% from last quarter's yield of 1.66%. Cemex looks to be undervalued. It possesses an EPS of $0.18, which has not changed since last quarter (Q2). Nexa Res's earnings per share for Q3 sits at $-0.37, whereas in Q2, they were at 0.61. Reliance Steel & Aluminum's earnings per share for Q3 sits at $6.48, whereas in Q2, they were at 9.15. The company's most recent dividend yield sits at 1.86%, which has decreased by 0.03% from 1.89% last quarter. Huntsman has reported Q3 earnings per share at $0.71, which has decreased by 44.53% compared to Q2, which was 1.28. Its most recent dividend yield is at 3.18%, which has increased by 0.23% from 2.95% in the previous quarter. The Significance: A value stock may need some time to rebound from its undervalued position. The risk of investing in a value stock is that this emergence may never materialize."

2023-04-20,Why Steel Dynamics Shares Are Soaring Today,"Steel Dynamics Inc (NASDAQ:STLD) shares are gaining around 8% today, following its mixed bag of first-quarter 2023 results. The company remains confident that market conditions are in place for solid domestic steel consumption. STLD reported Q1 revenues of $4.89 billion, down 12% Y/Y, missing the consensus of $5.00 billion. The company reported a record shipment of 3.3 million tons in Q1 versus 2.9 million tons a year ago. Operating income declined to $835.4 million in Q1 from $1.49 billion a year ago due to a significant Y/Y decline in operating income from Steel operations. Operating income from Steel operations was impacted by higher metal spread compression (up around $50 million) due to increased raw material costs, given the deployment of the remaining higher-priced pig iron ordered in early 2022 on the Ukraine and Russia supply-chain disruptions. Operating income from Steel Fabrication business rose to $551.3 million from $466.9 million a year ago on solid order entry from non-residential construction sector. Adjusted EPS of $4.01 came above the consensus of $3.52. Cash flow from operations stood at $733.8 million as of March 31, 2023. Steel Dynamics repurchased shares worth $354 million in Q1. The company witnessed operations ramp up at its newly started Sinton Flat Roll Steel Division and expects 2023 shipments to be around 80% of the plant's annual capacity. Order entry activity continues to be strong across all of our businesses. We believe North American steel consumption will increase in 2023, and that demand for lower-carbon emission, U.S. produced steel products coupled with lower imports will support steel pricing. We believe the automotive, non-residential construction, and energy sectors will remain solid steel consumers this year, said Mark D. Millett, Chairman and CEO. He further added, We are pleased to further diversify our end markets with plans to supply aluminum flat rolled products with high recycled content to the countercyclical sustainable beverage can industry, in addition to the automotive and industrial sectors. Price Action: STLD shares are trading higher by 7.97% at $114.69 on the last check Thursday."
2023-05-15,Retail Sales Preview: Will Consumer Demand Fall? How Markets Reacted To Prior Reports,"The Census Bureau is expected to publish U.S. retail sales data for April prior to the start of Tuesday's trading session. Here are five key takeaways for investors ahead of the report and analyst reactions to past releases. What Investors Need To Know Economists expect retail sales to rebound 0.7% month over month in April, after falling 0.6% in March. In annual terms, retail sales jumped 2.3% in March — the smallest surge since May 2020. Core retail sales (excluding automobiles) will likely increase 0.4% in April, rebounding from a 0.4% drop in March. Retail sales fell for the second consecutive month in March Increasing interest rates and cost concerns are weighing on consumers' propensity to spend. If retail sales fall in April, it would mark the third consecutive month of reductions. The last time three consecutive negative retail sales reports occurred was from August to October in 2015. How Did Markets React To Prior Retail Sales Reports? On April 14, preliminary retail sales for March delivered a 1% decline, then revised higher to a 0.6% drop, significantly lower than estimates of a 0.4% fall. Both the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSE:SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) fell 0.2% on that day. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) was the best performing sector after big banks reported stronger-than-expected Q1 results ahead of market open. Among large-cap stocks, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was the top performer on April 14, gaining 7.55%, as Q1 EPS came in over 20% higher than expected, Benzinga pro data shows. POSCO Holdings (NASDAQ:PKX) and Citigroup, Inc. (NYSE:C) were the second and the third best performing stocks, rising 4.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) — the worst performing name — was down 6.89%, followed by Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), down 6.3%. Retail Sales Data for February On March 14, preliminary retail sales for February delivered a 0.4% decline, then revised lower to a 0.7% drop, and below estimates of a 0.3% fall. The SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSE:SPY) fell 0.6% , while the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) rose 0.5% on that day. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC) outperformed as weaker-than-expected retail sales and troubles in US regional banks boosted expectations of lower Fed interest rates later in the year. Among large-cap stocks, Canadian Pacific Kansas City Ltd. (NYSE:CP) was the top performer on March 15, surging 5.65%. Tech giants traded higher: Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) up 3%; Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) up 2.4% and 2.3%; Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) up 1.9%; and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) up 1.8%. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Prudential Financial, Inc.

2023-06-12,A Bearish Sign Appears On Steel Dynamics's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Steel Dynamics, which is trading around $100.53 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at Steel Dynamics's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q1 2023 Q4 2022 Q3 2022 Q2 2022 EPS Estimate 3.52 3.79 5.02 6.34 EPS Actual 4.01 4.37 5.46 6.73 Revenue Estimate 5.00B 4.73B 5.44B 6.07B Revenue Actual 4.89B 4.83B 5.65B 6.21B Also consider this overview of Steel Dynamics analyst ratings: Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2023-06-16,Why Steel Dynamics Shares Are Sliding Today,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) shares are down Friday morning following its lackluster guidance for the second quarter 2023. The company expects second-quarter EPS of $4.78-$4.82, significantly lower than $6.44 a year ago. The Street view stands at $4.93. In the quarter to be reported, the company sees delays in some customer projects related to continued supply-chain constraints due to steel fabricators' extended backlogs, coupled with lack of construction materials and labor. Steel Dynamics expects metal margins to be lower than near-record first-quarter results. However, second-quarter profitability from the company's steel operations is expected to be significantly stronger than sequential first-quarter results. Steel order activity remains solid in the automotive, construction, industrial, and energy sectors. Second-quarter steel fabrication shipments are expected to be steady compared to the first quarter, partially offset by delays in some customer projects related to continued supply-chain constraints. Repurchase: The company repurchased $364 million, or 2%, of its common stock during the second quarter through June 9, 2023. Dividend: The company's second-quarter cash dividend of $0.425 per share is payable on or about July 14 to shareholders of record on June 30. Price Action: STLD shares are trading lower by 3.32% to $102.44 on the last check Friday."

2023-07-19,"Stocks Extend Gains, Dow Tops 35,000, Dollar Rebounds: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?","U.S. stocks are continuing their rally Wednesday, with the S&P 500 index on track for its seventh positive session in the last eight, reaching levels last seen in early April 2022. The Dow crossed the 35,000 milestone, on track for its fourth straight session of gains. Strong earnings remain the driving force behind the stock market, while investors eagerly await quarterly results from Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NYSE:UAL), all of which are scheduled to report after the closing bell. The market is now entering a light week in terms of macroeconomic releases, with only the S&P Global Flash PMI on Monday being in the spotlight before the pivotal event of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday, July 26. A lower-than-expected U.K. inflation rate, combined with increased speculation that the ECB may stop raising interest rates after July, created pressures in both the euro and the pound, fueling a rebound in the U.S. dollar index. Cues From Wednesday’s Trading: After officially entering a bull market on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to outperform other U.S. major averages on Wednesday, rising 0.4% for the day. The S&P 500 Index gained 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 inched 0.1% higher. Small caps in the Russell 2000 edged 0.2% higher.

The results on the surface probably won't offer much to write home about given consensus estimates imply a 7% year-over-year decline in S&P 500 earnings per share, said Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist, and Quincy Crosby, chief global strategist. “However, the key question is always what's priced in, which at least offers an opportunity for markets to react positively.” LPL's best guess, according to the analysts, is “typical upside surprises and guidance reductions,” giving this rally a convenient excuse to take a breather. Carson Group's Ryan Detrick, who is in the bullish camp, noted a historical trend that is positive for the market. The Russell 2,000 Index, comprising of small-cap stocks, had a gold cross technical move, i.e. the 50-day simple moving average crossing over above the longer-term 200-day moving average. This has happened 17 times in history and the market was higher three months later all the 17 times, BeSpoke's analysis showed, Detrick tweeted.

2023-09-25,"US Stocks See Modest Gains, Energy Outperforms, Bond Carnage Deepens: What's Driving Markets Monday?","In midday trading on Monday, U.S. stocks attempted a rebound following sharp losses experienced Friday. The bond market continued its downward spiral, with Treasury yields soaring to levels not seen in over a decade across maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. The energy sector continued to outperform, driven by oil giants capitalizing on crude prices that have remained at or above $90 per barrel. The U.S. dollar surged to its highest point in the past 10 months, on track for its eleventh consecutive week of gains. This remarkable ascent has been propelled by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance and deteriorating economic prospects in Europe. Cues From Monday’s Trading: The S&P 500 rose 0.4% on Monday, following a 1.6% decline on Friday and a nearly 3% drop last week. The Nasdaq 100 gained 0.4%, reacting after a 3.6% decline last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat for the day, while small caps in the Russell 2000 soared 0.6% after sinking 3.8% last week.

Technically, the S&P 500 has broken to the downside of a symmetrical triangle formation, Turnquist said. He flagged the sub-4,330 level as downside support in the 4,200-4,300 area, followed by the 200-day moving average at 4,189. Despite the recent pullback, there have been no major signs of a sustainable flight to safety, the analyst said. “Overall, we believe the market is down but not out,” he said. “Pullbacks are completely normal within the context of a bull market, and while the jump in rates is concerning, the S&P 500 remains in an uptrend, and above its rising 200-DMA.” Source: LPL Financial Monday’s Trading In Major US Equity ETFs The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.4% higher to $431.89.

Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders.

2023-10-16,"Tesla, Netflix Grab Earnings Spotlight This Week As Analysts Divided On Q3 Reporting Season: What's On Investors' Radar?","The third-quarter reporting season starts in earnest this week, with some high-profile names from the financial and tech spaces in the earnings mix. Mixed Expectations: S&P 500 earnings will likely increase for the first time in a year, according to FactSet. The blended year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 companies is estimated at 0.4%, marking the first earnings growth for the index since the third quarter of 2022, the firm said in its weekly earnings insights released Friday. With 6% of the S&P 500 earnings in so far, 84% of them have reported positive earnings per share upside, while 66% turned in a positive revenue surprise, it added. LPL analysts Jeffrey Buchbinder and Quincy Krosby see “what has already been priced in” as the question in the mind of market participants. This offers an opportunity for the markets to react positively, they say. “Our best guess is we get the typical upside surprises and guidance reductions, giving this rally a convenient excuse to take a breather,” Buchbinder and Krosby said. The views were echoed by Commonwealth Financial Network analyst Ron Swanke. “While companies may be able to beat the easy expectations for the third quarter, the guidance they provide for the future will be key to supporting S&P 500 valuations, which are still slightly above their long-term averages,” the analyst said. Swanke said he will pay close attention to profit margins in the third quarter and beyond, as companies will likely find it more difficult to pass on cost increases to consumers amid rising interest rates, tight job market, and the continued cooling off of inflationary pressure. The analyst expects net profit margins to fall from 11.9% a year ago to 11.7% in the third quarter. The key to achieving the 8.2% earnings per growth expected for the fourth quarter and 12.2% growth forecast for 2024 is whether companies can maintain high margins, he said, adding that revenue growth will likely be muted at 4.6% in the fourth quarter and 5.5% in 2024.

2023-10-18,"Stocks Dip As Yields Hit 5%, Oil Soars Amid Middle East Turmoil: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?","Wall Street tumbled during midday trading, with all major stock indices in the red, and only the energy sector showing gains for the session, while 30-year Treasury yields breached the 5% mark, hitting the highest level in over 17 years. The recent developments in the Middle East have weighed on risk sentiment after President Joe Biden defended Israel and condemned the ‘other team’ for the attack on the Gaza’s hospital on Tuesday which caused over 500 casualties. The president also pledged “unprecedented package support” for Israel to be approved by Congress as early as this week. Tech heavyweights, such as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will report their third-quarter earnings after the market close. Meanwhile, Iran’s threat to impose an oil embargo on Israel has reignited a rally in oil prices, with the WTI benchmark up 1.2%. This surge was further propelled by a larger-than-predicted draw in U.S. crude oil inventories last week, with a decrease of 4.491 million barrels compared to the expected 0.3 million. Cues From Wednesday’s Trading Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 fell 1%, while blue chip stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%. Small caps suffered substantially, with the Russell 2000 index down 1.7%.

For calendar year 2023, the analyst models essentially flat EPS of about $220.00 for the S&P 500 Index. Comerica’s preliminary 2024 S&P 500 EPS projection of $237.50 is about $10 less than the consensus forecast, Lynch said. “Of course, the combination of liquidity and hopes for an easing of Fed policy can play a role in valuation,” he added. Thursday’s Trading In Major US Equity ETFs The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 1% lower to $431.59 The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSE:RSP) fell 1.3% to $140.85 The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) fell 0.7% to $337.54 The Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) fell 1% to $364.53, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY) was the laggard, down 2%. Upcoming Economic Data: Fed Governor Christopher Waller stated that there is currently one rate hike penciled in, and whether or when it happens will be entirely determined by the data.
