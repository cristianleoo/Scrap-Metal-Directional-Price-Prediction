2010-01-29,"As The Dollar Inches Into Resistance, Expect A Commodity And Market Bounce","The markets have tumbled over the last two weeks giving a sour start to 2010. Many point to the fall as being a result of President Obama's tough talk on bank regulation, not allowing them to take risks that have been the key driver of profits. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLF) has tumbled in the last two weeks over 7%. For example, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) has tumbled from its high on January 7th, 2010 of $179.75 to recent lows of $148.27. While many blame earnings and the Presidents tough talk against Wall Street, there is another culprit. It seems that the real key to the drop on Wall Street is none other than the U.S. Dollar. The dollar has spiked higher over the last few months killing commodity prices. The price of oil dropped dramatically along with gold. Stocks like Southern Copper Corporation (USA) (NYSE: PCU), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) crashed in the last three weeks. These two stocks have fallen 27% and 25% respectively. In addition, the biggest players in the commodity realm have also seen a major price correction. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), each a major component of the DOW, have collapsed almost 10%. Being a major part of the DOW, this type of drop has a dramatic effect on the index itself and could be looked on as a major portion of the losses in the last two weeks in the markets. The root of the issue all comes back to the dollar. As the dollar has ripped higher, commodities have fallen. iPath S&P GSCI Crude Oil Total Return (NYSE: OIL) has fallen from $27.22 to $23.44. That is a 14% drop in a mere two weeks. The impact on the markets of this type of fall in commodities is earth shattering. To find the bottom in this market, the point where this market will get a significant bounce, one must turn to the charts of not oil, not gold, not XOM, CVX, GS or the XLF but to the U.S. Dollar. Everything comes back simply to the dollar. PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP) is closing in on a major resistance area and should spell a pullback. As we know, if the dollar pulls back, commodities will bounce. If commodities bounce, commodity stocks like XOM and CVX will bounce. If those stocks bounce, they will have a direct and major impact on the DOW. The markets will surge. This level on the dollar is the 200 moving average. It is close to hitting. In fact, the UUP (dollar ETF) is only a dime ($0.10) away. With this resistance point looming, expect the dollar to fall back and a bounce to come into the markets any day. This will most likely only be a short term bounce but a solid one. Enjoy the chart above of the dollar ETF, the UUP and the 200 moving average.

2010-02-12,"The Markets From The Eye Of A Trader (NYSE:SPY), (NASDAQ:STLD), (NASDAQ:QCOM), (NASDAQ:RIMM)","Ever since the reversal, short term bottoming signal on February 5th, 2010, the markets have traded in a wild manner. The bottoming tail on that day told me to look to go long but with the utmost care. Anytime you have a day where the markets flush out on heavy volume, and then reverse to close higher, it is a good bet there will be a short term reversal. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) hit a low that day of $104.58 and ended up closing all the way up at $106.66. The volume was the highest of any day since the March 2009 lows in the market. Funny yet scary how the close of on Friday February 5th, 2010 had 666 ($106.66) while the low from March, which just so happened to be around the same volume, was 666 on the S&P 500. In any case, while I expected this short term reversal, the markets still remained in a precarious place. Global debt and growth worries, China raising capital requirements for banks and currency worries, wildness. This alerted me to be extremely short term on any swing trades I took while using break even stops on all positions once they were in the money. Since that great reversal a week ago, the markets have done exactly what one would have expected. We have chopped up and down wildly, today being no exception with a general short term trend of higher. After a huge rally yesterday, China announced they would be raising their capital requirements for their banks. This immediately put pressure on the futures. The dollar started to jump as well. Anything that is not viewed as a positive for any country outside the United States will strengthen the dollar. This in turn puts pressure on the markets. I continue to expect further choppy upside trading in the coming one to two weeks. After this, I will be very careful as the markets may move sharply lower. Short term swing trades will continue to be the answer to profiting in this market. The technical levels dictate the entries. As I mentioned, the markets are selling again today after the big rally yesterday. At this point of the day we have negated all of yesterdays move. Stocks that continue to outperform are United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) and other commodity steel plays like Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD). These stocks have been hammered in recent weeks more so than other plays. It appears as if they are getting some continued short covering and upward momentum. The two technology stocks that are rallying higher today on an overall weak session are Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Research In Motion Limited (NASDAQ: RIMM). While most technology stocks are lower today, these two are higher. Research In Motion appears to have a clear path to gap window on the daily chart at $71.50. Once that price hits, there will be some resistance. It it breaks, the gap could be filled all thew ay to $83.00. Considering this market and the weakness, I would not hold my breath in the short term for that gap to be filled. Qualcomm Inc. has continued its upward move following yesterdays buy signal I wrote about when it hit $37.00. On the charts this is an unbelievable level of support and sure enough the stock continues to rip higher off that level. Since the hit of $37.00 yesterday, Qualcomm Inc. has gone to a high of $38.68. This move is probably coming to a short term end now. Consolidation is needed. Remember folks, this market is not a forgiving market right now. Never chase! Once a stock bounces, the entry is missed. Learn the technical levels, they work. Gareth Soloway Chief Market Strategist InTheMoneyStocks.com"
2010-03-03,United States Steel Corporation & Steel Dynamics Signal Possible Top,"United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) is running higher today on the back of a solid drop in the dollar. X is up $2.00 (3.57%). The dollar is getting hammered today as global optimism is chasing money away from the safety of the U.S Dollar. The PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (Public, NYSE: UUP) is trading higher by lower by $0.19 (0.80%). While X has had a great move higher since its 200ma daily low almost a month ago, it is coming into significant resistance. The key level here is $57.50. On the chart this shows directly as a possible drop level. Another stock that looks to be nearing massive resistance is Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD). Just like U.S. Steel, this stock has jumped significantly into massive daily resistance at $17.50. From this level, I am looking for a pullback of sizable proportions. Both stocks are in the same sector and are extremely over extended. I will release my exact entries should the swing trade meet my criteria in the Research Center at InTheMoneyStocks.com. My bias is now on the bearish side. Let's see how these play out!

2010-03-08,KeyBanc Upgrades Steel Dynamics (STLD),"KeyBanc Capital upgraded its rating of Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) to BUY from HOLD and established a $23 price target. KeyBanc cites “strong shipping momentum in flat-rolled and SBQ markets, increased likelihood of metal spread expansion, and marked improvement in scrap processing operations.” KeyBanc analysts note “accelerated upside in prime ferrous scrap costs, exacerbated by the continuation of miserable winter weather into early March, has supported more lackluster investor interest in EAF steel producers such as STLD.” KeyBanc Capital sees prices for hot-rolled carbon steel approaching $700/ton for May. Analysts see “a solid opportunity to shift emphasis into STLD for near-term alpha.” Currently Steel Dynamics, Inc is trading up 2.80%."

2010-06-17,Citigroup Lowers Estimates on Steel Dynamics; Reiterates Buy (STLD),"Citigroup is out with an analyst note this morning, where they reiterated their Buy rating on shares of Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD); they have a $22.00 price target on the stock. Citi analysts said, “STLD provided a 2Q quantitative guidance range of $0.20-$0.25, below our estimate of $0.27 and the consensus of $0.33. The company attributed the sequential earnings decline to lower recycling margins due to a mid-quarter fall in scrap pricing as well as decreased flat-rolled sales and profitability. Given that Butler’s 1Q production of 770k tons was an all-time record for STLD, we are not overly concerned with the sequential decline in sales volumes. Based on company guidance we are lowering our 2010 estimate to $1.28 from $1.30.” Citi also noted, “Planned maintenance and unplanned transformer repairs at Roanoke and Butler are expected to drive sequentially lower production and sales volumes for the quarter. Butler (flat-rolled) order entry rates slipped in June after a strong start to the quarter, but the company expects demand to pick up in mid-July following typical customer holiday shutdowns. Demand is strong for Engineered bar while utilization rates are increasing at Roanoke and Steel of West Virginia. Structural products demand remains weak.” Citigroup analysts closed by saying, “The slowdown in flat-rolled order entry rates is consistent with what we heard last week from US Steel during our various Pittsburgh HQ visits. Service centers appear to be buying cautiously given the recent decline in hot-rolled prices but inventories remain low. With the most recent US industry utilization rate at 74.6% vs Jan 1 at 61.5% and supportive ISM readings, utilization rates should rise to 80% by year-end, boosting STLD’s 2H10 mill profitability on higher fixed cost absorption. At 7.9x our sustainable earnings estimate of $1.81, we believe STLD’s shares present an attractive value and would buy on weakness.” Learn how to find the best stocks to trade each day in our 70 page E-Book and 90 minute online video for free."
2010-06-21,"Steel Sector: Positive or Negative? Barron’s (X, NUE, STLD, AKS)  ","One sector that has been badly hurt by negative sentiments over an economic slowdown in China, debt problems in Europe and a potential double dip recession in the U.S. is the steel complex. According to Barron’s, many steel stocks have gone through a deep correction lately and are looking quite attractive now. Stocks like US steel (NYSE: X), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) & A.K. Steel (NYSE: AKS) may provide outsized returns if they are picked up by investors at current levels. Analysts firmly believe that the Chinese economy will not be slowing down significantly and will continue to consume steel at current rates. China is the largest consumer of steel in the world."

2010-06-29,Slip and Slide  06-29-2010,"Cusick’s Corner The market continued to slide, wiping out this impressive rally that we have had since February. The sectors that have led this performance have been Consumer Discretionary and Financials. With consumer spending making up 2/3 of the GDP, any pullback in this segment is going to derail the near-term correction. Over the next week I will be reviewing the impact on Q3 & Q4 earnings estimates. At this stage, the GDP growth in theory looks to still be on target of 2.5% in the second half of next year. However, that Consumer Confidence number is a potentially yellow light on employment and income and we will need to see if that does actually translate into less spending. Watch 1031 on the S&P 500 to hold and for a break above 1050 to garner momentum to the upside. See you Midday. Stocks finished broadly lower following a day of heavy selling in overseas markets and disappointing economic data Tuesday. The stage was set for morning losses on Wall Street after markets across Europe and Asia fell on disappointing economic data out of China. The Shanghai Composite Index fell more than 4 percent. Losses were suffered across Europe as well, with a 4 percent loss in France’s CAC 40 Index helping to pace the decline. Meanwhile, the domestic news didn’t help much after the latest Consumer Confidence report showed a drop to 52.9 in June, down from 62.7 in May and significantly worse than the 62 reading that economists had expected. At the end of the day, the news didn’t offer much fodder for the bulls and the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 269 points. The tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 85.5. Bullish Flow VALE, the Brazilian steel and iron company, took a hit amid increasing worries about the global economic outlook. Shares finished down $1.72 to $24.91. In the options market, one contrarian minded investor appears to have initiated a bullish “risk-reversal” in the August 23 puts and August 27 calls, at a 24 cent net credit, 10000X. That is, they sold 10,000 August 23 puts at $1.14 and bought 10,000 August 27 calls at 90 cents. This strategist might be looking for shares to hold May lows around $23.50 and bounce higher, beyond the $27 strike price. They’re also making a pledge to buy the stock at $23 if it falls below that level before the August expiration. Bullish order flow was also seen in Electronic Arts (ERTS), MicroStrategy (MSTR), and US Airways (LCC). Bearish Flow Royal Caribbean (RCL), which had already suffered a 14.3 percent 5-day drop prior to Tuesday, lost another $2.25 to $23.06. Options action picked up as well, with 51,000 puts and 3,840 calls traded on the cruise ship operator. The top trades appear to be a position adjustment, where a strategist sold 12,500 September 32 puts at $9.10 and bought 25,000 September 21 puts at $1.95. That is, they probably exited a profitable position in September 32 puts and then bought another position, twice as big, in the September 21 puts. Bearish flow also picked up in Intrepid Potash (IPI), Steel Dynamics (STLD), and Avon Products (AVP). Index Trading The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) saw a spike amid increasing action in the index market Tuesday. The market’s “fear gauge” rallied 5.13 points to 34.13. Meanwhile, total index volume increased as well, with 560,000 calls and 698,000 puts traded across the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) and other cash indexes, which is more than 2X the volume seen the day before. Nervous investors scrambled to buy SPX puts to protect portfolios. Consequently, since VIX tracks the expected volatility priced into S&P 500 Index options, the surge in interest in the contract helped send VIX to three-week highs. ETF Trading A number of leveraged ETFs saw increasing volume, as options players jockeyed for position for the market’s next move. For example, the Proshares UltraShort S&P 500 Fund (SDS) jumped $2.11 to $36.88 and options volume hit 3X the average daily, with 108,000 calls and 28,000 puts traded on the ETF. Meanwhile, the Proshares Ultra S&P 500 (SSO), which lost $2.13 to $32.96, also saw 3X the normal options volume with 26,000 calls and 27,000 puts traded on the day. While SDS is designed to move 2X the opposite to the daily performance of the S&P 500, the SSO is designed to move 2X in the same direction."

2010-07-20,"Domestic Steel Names Surging (STLD, X, AKS)","Shares of steel companies are bucking the broader trend today and are moving higher. The catalyst for this move appears to be earnings from Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) and news out of China on energy demand. Last night Steel Dynamics reported earnings that fell short of Wall Street forecasts. Management, however, stated that they see markets for their steel products remaining relatively steady. Also last night, the International Energy Agency said China overtook the U.S. as the world's biggest energy user. This means that consumer and industrial demand in China is increasing and that the slowdown everyone is fearing may not be as severe as thought. Steel Dynamics is up 20 cents, or 1.43%, to $14.20. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) is up $1.00, or 2.43%, to $42.22. AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) is up 46 cents, or 3.41%, to $13.96."
2010-08-03,Earning Scorecard: AK Steel - Analyst Blog,"AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS), a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless, electrical steel and tubular products, posted better than expected second-quarter 2010 results primarily driven by higher steel shipments. Yet shares slipped 4% post results on an uncertain outlook over the iron pricing concerns. Second Quarter Highlights AK Steel posted net income of $26.7 million or 24 cents per share in the second quarter of 2010, reversing loses of $47.2 million or 43 cents in the year-ago quarter. Excluding one-time charges related to iron ore purchases, AK Steel earned $37.4 million or 34 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents by almost five times. Revenues Quarterly revenues more than doubled to $1.6 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.5 billion, primarily driven by higher shipments. Steel shipments nearly doubled to 1.4 million tons versus last year’s 740,600 tons. Average selling price for the reported quarter inched up 3% year over year and improved 9% sequentially to $1,101 per ton, which further triggered growth. (Read our full coverage on this earnings report: AKS Beats Handily, Outlook Uncertain) Agreement of Analysts Analysts and investors remained negative on AK Steel with higher benchmark iron ore pricing, lower selling prices for steel and a weak operating profit outlook. Although the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the latest quarter, 10 out of the 12 analysts covering the stock for the ongoing quarter slashed their EPS estimates in the last 7 days, while the same number of analysts had made negative revision to their estimates over the last one month. Of the 11 analysts covering the stock for the full year, 4 raised while 5 lowered their estimates in the last 7 days. Over the last 30 days, 8 analysts downgraded their estimates while 2 moved in the positive direction. Magnitude of Estimate Revisions The magnitude of estimate revisions indicates that the analysts were apprehensive about AK Steel’s near-term prospects. Recovery in the company’s Stainless and Electrical Steel segment, the second best performing business segment, remained slow due to an ailing construction and housing market. This is bad news for the company which generates about 43% of its revenues from the segment. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been on slippery ground since the earnings release. In the last 7 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter fell 2 cents and for the full year 2010, it decreased 7 cents. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a modest 2 cents and 62 cents for third quarter and full year 2010, with a downside potential of 150% and 6.45%, respectively. Our Take Iron ore pricing concerns have led to a negative outlook for steel manufacturers like AK Steel and Steel Dynamics Incorporated (STLD). Revenues and average selling prices are lower, as the U.S. and global markets are on a gradual recovery. The ongoing slowdown has marred prospects in the construction and housing sectors. AK Steel’s high margin electrical steel business is most affected by an end market slowdown. Last year, the company saw a significant decline in sales of grain-oriented electrical steel products globally due to the weak economy, which led to lesser consumer spending on new electric power transmission and distribution transformers. Besides, the imposition of duties on the import of electrical goods in China further affected AK Steel’s sales. Though there was some improvement in the electrical products business in the first half of 2010, it still remains below the historical highs. AK Steel predicts significant uncertainty regarding global iron ore pricing for 2010 and foresees operating profit to decline to $15 per ton in the upcoming quarter, assuming a 65% rise in iron ore benchmark prices. Steel shipments are expected to rise modestly while average selling price per ton would experience a stronger fall. However, a touch of optimism comes from the company’s diverse product portfolio; focus on products and markets that have greater potential to succeed in the long term as well as a sound liquidity position. This prompts us to remain Neutral on AK Steel in the long term (6 months and higher), with has a short-term (1 to 3 months) Zacks #3 Rank (“Hold”) currently.

2010-08-19,"Sounds Like China Is Lying.. So What Else Is New?? (BHP, RTP, VALE)","Chinese steelmakers appear to be gaining back bargaining power over their iron ore contracts the China Iron & Steel Association (CISA) said. Only thing is, I'm not sure how this is true. The facts just don't support the thesis. Since early July, iron ore prices have continued to climb on a resurgence in the steel markets. The world's three largest iron ore miners Rio Tinto (NYSE: RTP), BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) and Vale SA (NYSE: VALE), are fully exploiting this, taking the opportunity to push forward their new pricing regime. Back in April, the iron ore miners moved to quarterly pricing. The companies previously had annual contracts. This seems like propaganda from the Chinese, according to this report. It claims that the difference between spot prices and the new quarterly contracts will not impact the market much. But the key problem is that the new pricing mechanism provides larger room for iron ore speculation, one analyst said. This anonymous analyst is spot on, as speculators, hedge funds and other money managers begin to buy iron ore contracts that are just starting to be traded on exchanges. On August 12th, the CFR spot price of Indian 63.5 percent iron ore fines jumped to $155-15$7 per ton, despite market rumors that Rio Tinto had reached the third-quarter agreement of $147 per ton with its Japanese and South Korean customers. The CISA predicts that China's steel producers will be able to reject the ore giants' new price mechanism due to the reversing iron ore supply-demand situation. I just don't see this happening, as China continues to search for iron-ore. Why would Chinalco (NYSE: ACH) do a deal with Rio Tinto (NYSE: RTP) to secure iron-ore deposits if they didn't need it? So if they need it, how can they reject the market price? The two simply don't add up. Data shows that iron ore imports decreased from April to June. While I have to take the CISA at its word for this, it doesn't show that iron ore important increased in July, and are increasing again this month, as China begins its restocking of the material. To trade this, investors can look at the steel companies, and short them based on increases in iron ore prices. Names that pop out are Arcelor Mittal (NYSE: MT) and Steel Dynamics (NYSE: STLD). Go long the iron ore miners, such as Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF) or even U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), which owns its own iron ore supplies. In addition, any of the major miners, like RTP, BHP or VALE are worth a look on this as well. Sorry China, looks like you're stuck again. Get free trades at tradeMONSTER!"

2010-08-31,Metals and Mining Review - Sept. 2010 - Industry Outlook,"Overview The Metals & Mining Industry encompasses the extraction (mining), as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output. The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars. Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal (MT), the world’s largest steel producing company, produced 73.2 million tons in 2009, representing 6% of the world's steel output. The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls. Anglo American Plc., the largest gold producer by market capitalization, dominates the gold industry. Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Corporation (GM), Ford Motor Company (F), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) and Honda Motor Company (HMC) are big consumers of metals, chiefly steel and aluminum. Outlook The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover, develop new deposits and boost reserves, while smaller ones own few mines and concentrate on them. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has historically been a critically important growth strategy for metal companies. While the slow economic recovery is a significant factor in short-term decisions regarding M&A activity, mining companies expect to make acquisitions over the next three years. The M&A activity is also supported by higher metal prices that have strengthened the financial positions of many mining giants. Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals, especially China and India. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could -- theoretically, at least -- double metal demand in the longer term. In recent years, capacity growth in China has significantly exceeded the growth in market demand. A continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in China’s rate of economic expansion could result in the country increasing its metal exports. Yet, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries. Developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery. Despite some concerns about its sustainability, China is expected to remain the largest consumer of metals in the future. Metals in Detail: Steel As the major shareholder (about 60%) in the metals market, the steel industry was strongly affected by the global economic downturn. Massive over-capacity is one of the major headwinds for steel, which continues to weigh on prices. Moreover, the industry has witnessed a number of trade disputes involving the U.S., in particular, the imposition of tariffs of up to 30% on imported steel. Rising raw material prices -- iron ore and coal (metallurgical) -- are also a major concern for the steel industry. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS), for instance, expects a 65% rise in benchmark iron ore prices in the near term. Demand in key metal consuming industries such as autos, shipbuilding and construction, continues to remain weak, forcing global metal producers to slacken output levels. While utilization levels have improved recently, steel makers were operating at less than 50% capacity last year. U.S. Steel Corporation (X) -- the eighth largest steel producer in the world, the largest integrated steel producer headquartered in North America and one of the largest integrated flat-rolled producers in Central Europe -- slashed production by almost 37% in 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO (PKX) had to scale down output by about 10.9%. Steel demand is reviving slowly, with improving end-markets on the back of a recovering global economy. Steel giant ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel are restarting furnaces or are planning to in the near future. Industry steel mill utilization rates have increased to above 70%. The current high in steel demand helped reverse losses for the third largest steel maker Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) and the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S., Nucor Corporation (NUE). Steel Dynamics’ second-quarter earnings of 22 cents reversed losses of 8 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, Nucor reported a profit of 29 cents per share in the second quarter of 2010, in contrast to a net loss of 43 cents per share in the same quarter of 2009. The World Steel Association expects a 10.7% increase in global steel demand this year and a further 5.3% gain in 2011 compared to 2010 level. The impetus is mostly expected from a surge in Chinese steel demand, which is likely to grow 6.7% to 579 million tons in 2010. But despite these improving trends, average selling prices are still struggling, as the pace of recovery in the U.S. and global markets is slow at best. The ongoing slowdown has marred prospects in the housing and construction sectors in the near term. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS), Nucor and Steel Dynamics have provided a bleak overall near-term price outlook, although they expect end-markets to stabilize. Collectively, AK Steel, Nucor and ArcelorMittal have a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) for the short-term (1 to 3 months), while we maintain our Neutral recommendation in the long term for all three, given the outlook for steel. However, Steel Dynamics holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) and has a long-term Underperform recommendation driven by a very weak earnings outlook. Gold The outlook for investment is positive overall, with absolute levels of demand likely to remain well supported by continued economic and currency uncertainty, inflation concerns and the search for diversification. In 2009, global gold supply exceeded demand by 15%, reflecting favorable gold prices. However, based on the marginal improvement in the economic environment in 2010, the World Gold Council expects an increase in demand for jewelry, which in turn will help global gold demand. A potential shot in the arm for the precious metal is the expected increase in central bank gold holdings, primarily as a diversification play. The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continues to rebound from the low levels in 2009, while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China in the next half of 2010. Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years. Concerns over the recent European debt crisis have also led to strong buying of gold coins, bars and gold exchange traded funds in particular. We saw gold demand and prices strengthen in the first six months of 2010, a trend that is likely to remain in place in the rest of the year. Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG). However, gold producers Newmont Mining (NEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices. Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this overall favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall neutral view on the space. Aluminum The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. Aluminum prices at the LME have plunged around 20% from their April highs to $1,969 per ton. The greatest risk for aluminum producers would be a further decline in aluminum prices. However, we expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa Inc. (AA), Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG) and Aluminum Corporation of China (ACH) should benefit from the improving demand outlook. In the medium to long term, Alcoa expects aluminum consumption to improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal. Alcoa now expects demand to grow about 10% to 12% in 2010. The aluminum giant predicts Chinese aluminum consumption to jump 21% and about 6.5% globally (excluding China) in 2010. Currently, Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver and Aluminum Corporation of China hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by a long-term Neutral recommendation. Copper Copper prices started on a downtrend in early July 2010 and are expected to remain volatile in the near term, which could be a major headwind for copper companies. Revenues and margins for copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO) were affected by the recent fall in copper prices and volumes, primarily driven by the slowing economic activities in China. However, the long-term view is favorable. Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. Copper companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand in copper in the developing markets. The near-term headwinds led to the short-term Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) and Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Freeport and Southern Copper, respectively. However, both companies have a Neutral recommendation on a positive long-term outlook.

The company also indicated that it expects third quarter earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10, as compared to second quarter 2010 earnings of $0.22 per diluted share and third quarter 2009 earnings of $0.30 per diluted share."
2010-09-15,"Watch Out U.S. Steel, You Might Be Next (AKS, STLD, X)","AK Steel (NYSE: AKS), Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) all recently lowered their earnings expectations for the third quarter, due to higher input costs, lower sales prices, and a blast furnace outage at AK's Ashland furnace. How does this look for U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) and its shareholders? It's a mix at this point, with more negative points than good at this time. One positive for U.S. Steel the higher input costs, as X owns their own iron ore plants, a significant cost of making steel. AK and Steel Dynamics do not, and thus have less control over their input costs than U.S. Steel does. That's about it for the positives. The negatives seem to far outweigh the lone positive at this point, with slowdowns in construction spending, lower sales prices among the reasons to blame. Another negative is the price of scrap metal, which has been rising as the automobile industry slowed down over the summer months, easing the oversupply of scrap metal, and thus causing the price to rise. In a statement released yesterday, Nucor said, Our third-quarter results will unfortunately confirm these concerns and a general slowdown has indeed occurred from the second quarter, particularly in our flat-rolled business. I would expect U.S. Steel to echo the same sentiments of its competitors, and lower its earnings outlook for the third quarter. Shares of X have fallen in recent days on the lowered outlooks from its competitors, so shares may not fall too much further. Since the beginning of the week, shares have fallen approximately 4%, about in line with its competitors on the weakened outlook. Investors and traders should be aware that the next shoe is about to drop, and X marks the spot this time. Disclosure: long X See more real-time trading ideas Here"
2010-09-15,STLD's Dismal 3Q Guidance - Analyst Blog,"Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD), one of the leading steel producers in the US, forecasts a bleak third quarter for 2010. The company expects subdued performance in the Steel segment to impact results negatively in the upcoming quarter. It foresees net earnings of a meager 5 to 10 cents per share. Lower selling prices particularly in the sheet and structural steel operations would reduce net earnings substantially from last year's net earnings of 30 cents. Steel Dynamics assumes a 4 cents reduction in third quarter 2010 earnings per share due to a 10% decline in nugget selling prices and higher costs of production at the recently started Mesabi Nugget project in Minnesota that produces iron nuggets for mini-mill steelmaking. A higher than anticipated effective tax rate would further reduce earnings by 2 cents. Steel Dynamics expects Metals recycling operations to be affected by the sequential reduction in ferrous metal spreads and reduced volumes. However, Steel Dynamics stated that sheet demand has improved quarter over quarter and hence the company can expect a better full year result provided the current surge in sheet demand continues. The company also foresees improving start up activities at the Mesabi facility and anticipates a 65% to 70% sequential increase in production. Projected third quarter results would be a significant 54% decline from the second quarter 2010 earnings of 22 cents and would be well below the Zacks Consensus as well. Steel Dynamics has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters as reflected by an average surprise of a negative 0.60%. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents for the upcoming quarter has a downside potential of 9.09%. Steel Dynamics' depressing third quarter outlook triggered the negative market sentiment on the stock. The company's shares lost 19% in last six months and closed at $14.59 on September 14, 2010. Currently, Steel Dynamics is a short-term (1 to 3 months) Zacks #5 Rank (“Strong Sell”) and a long-term (6+ months) underperform recommendation.

2010-09-16,"Have Steel Stocks Bottomed? (NUE, STLD, AKS, X)","First came Nucor (NYSE: NUE). Then came Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD). Then came AKS Steel (NYSE: AKS). One by one, these U.S. steelmakers lowered their guidance for the third quarter. Nucor cited weak demand in the construction sector, Steel Dynamics said results would be hurt by reduced margins and lower sales prices, AK Steel cited higher iron ore costs that would crimp its earnings. The steel industry has had a sluggish recovery due to the fact its biggest customer is the non-residential construction sector, which has yet to rebound. However, after trading lower much of this week, all three names are higher today, suggesting that a near-term bottom may be in place as the negative news has been discounted. Nucor is up 0.10%, Steel Dynamics is higher by 1.22%, and AK Steel is up 1.02%. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), which did not give a third-quarter earnings warning, is higher by 1.59%."
2010-09-16,AK Steel Slashes 3Q Guidance - Analyst Blog,"Shares of steel maker AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) slipped 5.71% or 83 cents and closed at $13.70 on September 15, 2010 after the company forecasted operating losses in the third quarter of 2010. AK Steel foresees operating losses of $20 per ton in the third quarter in contrast to its previous guidance of $15 per ton of operating profits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at a loss of 2 cents. AK Steel attributed the estimated loss primarily to the cost related with the planned maintenance shutdown of the Ashland facility in Kentucky. The blast furnace in Kentucky was scheduled to be under maintenance in the first half of 2011. However, bad furnace conditions forced AK steel to prepone the maintenance. The company plans an 11 day production outage at the facility starting from September 20, 2010. Besides, AK Steel expects soaring iron-ore prices, the key raw material for steel production, to further increase to the company's operating losses in the third quarter. Earlier, in its second quarter 2010 earnings release, AK Steel had forecasted a 65% year over year increase in iron prices in 2010. Although the company remains uncertain about the raw material prices, it expects increasing demand in China and other foreign markets to push iron prices to an exorbitant level. AK Steel stated that an every 5% increase in iron price above 65% would affect results by $11 million or $7 per ton. In last couple of days, two other steel makers, Nucor Corporation (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) slashed their third quarter 2010 guidance citing global economic uncertainty. Nucor, the nations largest scrap recycler stated that rising demand in emerging economies, especially China has triggered the scrap costs to rise above expected level. The company is also facing a weak domestic demand environment that partially offsets the benefits of increasing international demand. The steel maker projects third quarter 2010 earnings within $0.05 to $0.10 per share significantly down from 29 cents and 10 cents in the second quarter and first quarter of 2010, respectively. The projected third quarter earnings are substantially below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents with a downside potential of 9.68%. Similarly, Steel Dynamics, one of the leading steel producers in the US forecasts a bleak third quarter 2010 due to a subdued performance in the Steel segment. It foresees net earnings of a meager 5 cents to 10 cents per share. Lower selling prices particularly in the sheet and structural steel operations would reduce net earnings substantially from last year's net earnings of 30 cents. Projected third quarter results would be a significant 54% decline from the second quarter 2010 earnings of 22 cents and would underperform the Zacks Consensus as well. We believe third quarter 2010 could be depressing for the steel industry as a whole with already three steel producers slashing guidance. Things would surface better with further outlook updates from other major steel makers including United States Steel (X) and Arcelor Mittal (MT).

2010-10-07,Steel Dynamics Adds Capacity - Analyst Blog,"Anticipating a stronger non-residential construction market in the longer term, Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD), one of the leading steel producers in the U.S., is ramping up steel capacity at its New Millennium Building Systems subsidiary. The company has recently announced its decision to acquire some of Commercial Metals Corporation's idled steel-joist manufacturing facilities located in Arkansas, Nevada and Mexico. In addition, Steel Dynamics will also purchase production and material handling equipment from Commercial Metals. The total cost for the plant and assets purchased is estimated at $17 million. Steel Dynamics expects to spend about $20 to $25 million to upgrade each plant. Earlier in February this year, Commercial Metals, a Texas-based steel producer had announced the divestiture of its steel joist business on weak demand conditions in the construction markets. The transaction is scheduled to close by the end of October 2010. With the new capacity, Steel Dynamics would expand in the Southwest and Western regions and become the second largest provider of steel joists and decking. The company plans to resume operations at the plants shortly. However, we are not too confident of this move in a scenario of weak end-markets and a slow economic recovery. Particularly since just a week before, Steel Dynamics had forecasted a bleak third quarter for 2010. The company stated that the sluggish Steel segment would negatively impact results in the upcoming quarter, with net earnings of a meager 5 to 10 cents per share. Lower selling prices, particularly in the sheet and structural steel operations are expected to reduce net earnings substantially from last year's net earnings of 30 cents. Steel Dynamics expects Metals recycling operations to be affected by the sequential reduction in ferrous metal spreads and reduced volumes. However, the company sees some improvement in sheet demand, which should drive full-year results. Yet, projected third quarter results would be a significant decline of 54% from the second quarter 2010 earnings of 22 cents and would be well below the Zacks Consensus as well.

2010-10-20,STLD Falters on Lower Steel Prices - Analyst Blog,"Steel Dynamics Inc.'s (STLD) net income of $19 million or 9 cents per share in the third quarter of 2010 plummeted 72% from last year's $69 million or 30 cents. Sequentially, it declined 29% from $49 million or 22 cents. However, results matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate, as the lower steel selling prices and nearly flat shipments were more or less within analyst expectations. Average realized steel prices were down 6% to $782 per ton. Although average realized steel prices are softening, they remain above year-ago levels. A 22% year-over-year increase in average steel prices to $782 per ton, coupled with a 5% increase in steel shipments to 1.3 million tons yielded revenue growth of 35% to $1.6 billion in the quarter. Quarterly revenues exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.5 billion. On a sequential basis, revenues reflected a modest 3% improvement with a 6% fall in steel prices partially offset by a 4% rise in steel shipments. Operating costs escalated 51% to $1.4 billion, eroding profits. Operating income more than halved to $69 million from $148 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating margins came in at 4% versus 13% in the same quarter of the previous year. Segment Review Steel Operations Revenues of $960 million were up 29% year over year. Steel shipments increased 6% to 1.3 million tons, of which flat-rolled products accounted for the largest share of 60% (down from 64% in the previous quarter). Structural steel and rail, and engineered bars each accounted for 12% of total shipments. Merchant bars and Steel of West Virginia constituted about 11% and 5%, respectively of total shipments. Average selling prices were up 22% year over year to $782 per ton, while declining 6%, sequentially. However, higher costs led to a 37% decline in operating income that totaled $88 million or $68 per toncompared with $108 per ton in the second quarter of 2010. Metals Recycling and Ferrous Resources Net sales shot up 69% to $558 million on higher shipments. Ferrous metal shipments increased 26% to 805,474 tons while non-ferrous shipments increased 17% to 254,730 tons. The Mesabi Nugget project, which started operations recently, reported production of 24,553 tons, which is supplied to Steel Dynamic's flat-rolled and engineered bar businesses. However, operating income plunged 40% year over year to $9 million, hurt by higher costs. Steel Fabrication Operations The segment includes the New Millennium Building Systems fabricating plants that produce joists, trusses and steel decking used in the construction of non-residential buildings. Third quarter net sales were $54 million on shipments of 46,709 tons compared with net sales of $32 million on shipments of 34,089 in the third quarter of 2009. Operating loss narrowed slightly to $494,000 from a $5 million loss in the year earlier quarter. Financial View Steel Dynamics' debt-to-capital ratio has remained above 50% in the last three quarters. As of September 30, 2010, Steel Dynamics recorded long-term debt of $2.4 billion while about $8.4 million are payable in the short term. Cash and cash equivalent of $270 million, though sufficient to offload the immediate debt lacks the long-term leverage. Guidance Steel Dynamics foresees margin improvement in both the Steel Operations and Metals Recycling segments for the fourth quarter of 2010. However, the company remains unsure of the demand for flat-rolled steel products. It also expects to record a one-time charge related to the recent purchase of certain steel fabrication assets from Commercial Metals Corporation. Zacks Consensus Estimate Steel Dynamics has exhibited a negative earnings trend over the past two quarters. The company missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters and posted a negative average earnings surprise of 0.60%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upcoming quarter and full year 2010 is pegged at 20 cents and 78 cents with a downside potential of 25% and 6.41%, respectively. As a result, Steel Dynamics now has a short-term (1 to 3 months) rating of Strong Sell, as denoted by the Zacks #5 Rank, as well as a long-term Underperform recommendation.

2010-10-29,Steel Industry Outlook - Nov. 2010 - Industry Outlook,"The U.S. houses one of the world's largest steel industries. It is rather concentrated in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion's share of sales. ArcelorMittal (MT) is the world's largest steel company, with crude steel production of 73.2 million tons in 2009, representing about 6% of the global steel output. Steel products are classified into four broad categories: flat steel products, long steel products, scrap and semi-finished products. Flat products include plates, hot-rolled strip and sheets, and cold-rolled strip and sheets. The long steel product category comprises wire rods, beams, reinforced bars and merchant bars. The products under both these categories are rolled from steel slabs, which are considered as unfinished or semi-finished products that are generally not sold. Historically, the automotive and construction markets have remained the largest consumers of steel, absorbing more than half of the total steel produced. Large automakers such as General Motors (MTLQQ), Ford Motor Company (F), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) and Honda Motor Company (HMC) depend upon the steel industry. Other steel consuming industries include appliances, agricultural implements, converters, containers, energy, electrical equipment and industrial machinery. Growth Trends Accelerating demand in the automobile and construction markets triggered production growth in the steel industry before the recession hit. However, the global economic turmoil that started at the end of 2008 and continued through much of 2009 severely impacted both these markets, with the demand for steel nose-diving as a consequence. Steel manufacturers saw inventories soaring and scrambled to cut production. With the global economy picking up in late 2009, the steel industry started seeing signs of improvement. However, given its economic sensitivity, we expect global steel demand to improve only gradually, in line with the recovery in the user industries, especially automotive and residential construction. According to World Steel Association (“worldsteel”), steel demand in the U.S. was down 41.6% in 2009 at 57.4 million tons. However, with the economy in recovery mode, the industrial sector is expected to drive a 26.5% increase in steel demand in the U.S. in 2010 and a further 7.5% in 2011 to 78.1 million tons. The emerging economies reflected growth trends throughout the recession and are expected to continue to drive steel demand, going forward. Worldsteel expects steel demand in India to grow 13.9% and 13.7% in 2010 and 2011, respectively, following a growth of 7.7% in 2009. The European Union experienced a 35.2% decline in steel demand in 2009. Spain and Italy saw a significant fall in steel production with the breakdown of their construction market. According to the association, in 2010 the European region will see an increase of 13.7% in steel demand, driven by the restocking of inventory. Japan would see steel demand rising 10.3% in 2010 after a 31.7% fall in 2009. However, worldsteel expects Chinese steel consumption to increase by a modest 6.7% to 579 million tons in 2010, after an impressive 24.8% increase in 2009. Expansionary Chinese economic policies, easy credit and construction initiatives have thus far sustained demand. But with China attempting to rein in its overheated property sector and engineer a soft landing for its economy, steel demand will most likely soften noticeably in the coming months. Globally, worldsteel anticipates steel demand to rise 10.7% to 1,241 million tons in 2010 in contrast to last year's decline of 6.7%. For 2011, worldsteel expects global steel requirement to inch up 5.3% to 1,306 million tons. Production Scenario The year 2010 started well for the steel industry, with improving demand conditions in several end markets, leading to a steady rise in steel production worldwide. All major steel-producing countries -- Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Russia, Turkey, the U.S. and Ukraine -- have recorded healthy production so far this year. According to worldsteel, North American steel output jumped 50.3% year over year to 74.8 million tons in the first 8 months of 2010. However, it is still lagging the 19.4% growth rate seen in 2008. In the European Union, steel production shot up 37.5% to 115.6 million tons in the first 8 months of 2010 while production in Asia climbed 17.8% to 592.7 million tons. Of this, China experienced a 15.3% production growth to 425.7 million tons while Japanese production leapt 38.1% to 72.7 million tons over the first 8 months. Over the same period, steel production in Brazil soared 40.5% to 22.1 million tons and that in Russia jumped 15.4% to 43.8 million tons. In Ukraine, steel production moved up 11.7% to 21.2 million tons. Industry Capacity The global steel industry is capital intensive, cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity. Capacity utilization rates were, however, low (around 60%) at the beginning of 2009, in response to the much softer demand. With steel demand picking up in the latter half of the year, capacity utilization rates increased to above 70%. Utilization rates continued to increase in the first half of 2010, averaging at over 80%. The capacity utilization rate has, however, come down to around 70% again since then. Steel makers continue to add capacity besides resuming operations at the idled facilities, inspired by the expected rebound in steel industry in the longer term. Price Trends The steel industry has long witnessed volatility in prices with a large spot market. Steel prices rose steadily for most of 2008, after which there was a downtrend. Lower prices had an adverse effect on steel producers, who recorded lower revenues and margins, and had to write down finished steel and raw material inventories. The period witnessed major steel producers slashing production to minimize inventory accumulation. U.S. Steel Corporation (X), the fifth-largest steel producer worldwide, cut down production by almost 62% during the second quarter of 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO (PKX) cut production by about 15%. This was the first time in its history that POSCO was forced to adopt such a measure, proof of the very adverse operating environment. Although steel prices have been stabilizing since the latter part of 2009, it is significantly below the pre-crisis level. We believe that a sustained recovery in steel prices remains uncertain in the backdrop of sluggish economic activity. Factors Affecting Steel Prices Chinese Imports: The steel industry is also affected by fluctuations in steel import–export and tariffs. China is the largest steel producer globally, with the balance between its domestic production and consumption being an important factor in global steel prices. Consumers in the U.S. are importing cheaper steel from China, which is forcing domestic steel producers to sell at lower prices, and even at a loss, sometimes. To this end, the U.S. government has been imposing anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel imports. Concerns about the sustainability of economic recovery and question marks about China's growth momentum come into play in the pricing equation. This relatively uncertain China outlook, coupled with a still tentative recovery in the developed world, is expected to weigh on prices. Threat from substitutes: Steel has many substitutes like aluminum, which replaces it in the automotive markets. Cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood are also used as steel substitutes. This significantly influences market prices and demand for steel products. Raw Material Trends The key input for steel production is iron ore. Apart from this, coking coal and coke, scrap, electricity and natural gas are also used as inputs in steel production. The raw materials industry is highly concentrated with only three major players -- Vale (VALE), Rio Tinto (RTP) and BHP Billiton (BHP) – having significant pricing power. The risk lies in consolidation among raw material suppliers. For instance, the announced iron ore joint venture between mining companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto would further increase the pricing power of both the suppliers. Steel makers would face higher production costs if suppliers shift to sales based on spot prices from the long-term fixed price contract system, as spot prices for most of the raw materials, especially iron ore, remained high from 2006 through 2008. In 2009, iron ore prices, which are linked with the London Metal Exchange prices, were about 28% to 33% below the benchmark prices. Iron ore prices have remained volatile during most of 2010 and are expected to rise sharply in 2011. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) expects a 65% rise in benchmark iron ore prices in the near term. The company assumes reduction of its earnings by $11 million or $7 per ton for each 5% increase in iron ore prices. The prices of coking coal, zinc and nickel, as well as scrap, have followed a similar trend. Consolidation Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have remained an important business strategy in the steel industry. M&A activities prevent additional steel capacity, providing production efficiency and economies of scale. The biggest example is Mittal Steel's acquisition of Arcelor in 2006 and their merger in 2007. The Tata Steel and Corus merger in 2008 is another good instance of industry consolidation. The industry is likely to see more M&A activity in the coming years as the industry players prepare themselves for a recovery in the long run. Zacks Recommendation Iron ore pricing concerns have led to a negative outlook for steel manufacturers. Revenues and average selling prices are lower, as the U.S. and global markets are in a gradual recovery. In the short term, we are negative on steel manufacturers like AK Steel Holding Corporation, Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) and Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI). AK Steel's cost structure is higher than its peer group due to a greater reliance on an external supply of raw materials such as carbon scrap, purchased slabs, iron ore and purchased coke. Iron ore is the key raw material in steel manufacturing operations. The company expects to purchase about 6 million tons of iron ore pellets in 2010. One of the largest and most diversified producers of specialty materials in the world, Allegheny Technologies has forecasted operating losses in the near-term. Allegheny has been battling cost-pressures associated with high raw material costs. For Allegheny, a hypothetical $1.00 per mmbtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of about $10 to $12 million. Costs of scrap and oil are also rising significantly. A change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of about $80 million, while a hike of $0.01 per pound of ferrous scrap would result in increased costs of approximately $5 million. We remain strongly negative on Steel Dynamics, the third-largest steel maker in the U.S., who is operating its structural steel mills at less than 40% of its total capacity due to uncertain demand conditions. However, industry giants with integrated business models like U.S. Steel Corp and ArcelorMittal have an edge over their peers. Both steel makers have substantial captive sources of iron ore and coal and source about 75%–80% of their coke and iron ore requirements from owned and/or operated facilities. U.S. Steel Corp returned to profitability in the second quarter of 2010 on improving business conditions. Similarly, earnings of Nucor Corporation, the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S. , broke out from the loss territory in the last quarter of 2009. We expect Nucor to exhibit strong profitability driven by long-term contracts, cost reduction efforts and a dominant acquisition strategy. Collectively, ArcelorMittal, AK Steel, Allegheny Technologies, United States Steel Corporation and Nucor Corporation carry long-term Neutral recommendations, while Steel Dynamics has a long-term Underperform recommendation.

2011-01-18,AK Steel Wins Lawsuit - Analyst Blog,"AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS) won a lawsuit brought against the company by two French units of the steel giant, ArcelorMittal (MT). The suit alleged that AK Steel and two other steel producers infringed upon a U.S. patent for aluminum-coated, boron-bearing carbon steels, used primarily for high-strength automotive applications. However, the jury found no infringement of the ArcelorMittal patent. The decision now allows AK Steel to begin offering the product for sale immediately to the U.S. customers. Though the company had the capability to produce steel, prospective customers were not buying because of fear of a legal conflict. AK Steel employs about 6,200 people and produces flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, as well as carbon and stainless tubular steel products. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, AK Steel posted net loss of $59.2 million or 54 cents per share versus a net income of $6.2 million or 6 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Reported losses were higher than the Zacks Consensus loss of 34 cents per share. AK Steel has a more diverse product portfolio compared to its peers. The company is focusing on markets and products that have greater potential in the long term. However, average selling prices are lower, as the U.S. and global markets are on a gradual recovery. The ongoing slowdown has marred prospects in the housing and construction sectors. We expect AK Steel to report a weak fourth quarter with rising iron ore costs and moderating steel prices. AK Steel faces stiff competition from Nucor Corporation (NUE), Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) and ArcelorMittal. Currently, AK Steel has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short term and an Underperform recommendation for the long term.

2011-01-25,AK Steel Underperforms - Analyst Blog,"AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) reported fourth quarter results incurring an adjusted after-tax loss of $54.5 million or 49 cents per share outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 62 cents per share. Fourth quarter results excluded one-time items of $63.7 million pre-tax charge related to the earlier announced AK Steel Holding Corporation and $9.1 million pre-tax charge pertaining to a retiree benefit settlement associated with the company's Butler (PA) Works. Including these special items, the company reported a loss of $98.3 million or 89 cents per share compared with a net income of $39.8 million or 36 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. For fiscal FY10, the company reported after-tax loss of $59.8 million or 54 cents per share outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 68 cents per share. Fiscal FY10 excluded $72.8 million of charges mentioned above and a non-cash charge of $25.3 million, related to federal healthcare legislation. Including these charges full year EPS amounted to a net loss of $128.9 million or $1.17 per share compared with a net loss of $74.6 million or 68 cents in the prior year. Total revenue as reported by the company increased 5.5% year over year to $1,390.6 million in the reported quarter. However, shipments decreased marginally by 0.6% year over year to 1,359,900 tons. The revenue as reported by the company was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The increase in total revenue was attributable to higher selling price. For fiscal FY10, the company reported net sales of $5968.3 million, an increase of 46.4% year over year. Total revenue as reported by the company was slightly above the Zacks Consensus estimate of $5966 million. Cost and Margins The cost of goods sold increased 21.48% year over year to $1,373.80 million in the quarter and selling and administrative expenses increased 1.2% year over year to $52 million in the quarter. The company also reported an operating loss of $154.6 million, a decrease of 44% from the year-ago quarter, leading to an operating margin decrease of 453 basis points year over year to a negative 11.12%. In fiscal FY10 cost of goods sold increased approximately 50% year over year to $5621.50 million and selling and administrative expenses increased 9.4% to $210.8 million from the prior year. Operating loss of the company increased by 91% year over year to $133.9 million. Consequently, operating margin decreased by 52 basis points year over year to a negative 2.24% Financial Position The company ended the year with a cash and cash equivalent of $216.8 million compared with $461.7 million as of December 31, 2009. Cash from operating activities was an outflow of $132.4 million for fiscal 2010 compared with an inflow of $58.8 million for fiscal 2009. The debt-to-capital ratio of A K Steel stood at 50.2% as of December 31, 2010, 38.4% as of September 30, 2010 and 36.6% as of June 30, 2010. Outlook A K Steel expects an increase of 7% quarter over quarter in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 leading to 1,450,000 tons and approximately 8% quarter over quarter increase in its average per-ton selling price compared with the fourth quarter price level. The expected increase is attributable to the anticipated higher contract and spot market prices and better product mix. For iron ore, scrap and coal, the company expects higher price of raw material, likely to be offset by an improved operating performance. At the operating level, the company expects to break even for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. About the Company Ohio-based AK Steel Holding Corporation is a leading producer of flat-rolled carbon, stainless, electrical steel and tubular products.

2011-01-25,Dahlman Rose Gives Color On Steel Dynamics Earnings Miss,"Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) reported 4Q10 adjusted EPS below Dahlman's and consensus estimates. It expects to see a significant improvement in 1Q11 results as the company realizes the benefit of higher volumes and prices. Adjusted results, which exclude a $0.03 EPS non-cash asset impairment charge, were below Dahlman's estimate of $0.10 and the consensus estimate of $0.08. Results compare with EPS of $0.09 and $0.12 in the previous quarter and year ago period, respectively, but were within the company's EPS guidance range of $0.05 - $0.10. Variance from the estimate is mostly due to softer than anticipated results in the company's Metals Recycling and Ferrous Resources division caused by an unrealized hedging loss associated with copper inventories. Without this loss, 4Q10 EPS would have been $0.09. Management indicated that pricing and volumes improved over the course of the quarter, and we anticipate that this impact will be mostly realized this quarter, with some carryover into 2Q11. Further, given the improvements in pricing that have recently occurred, Dahlman should see continued improvement in 2Q11 results. While it has commented on the strength in demand and pricing in the flat rolled segment, management also indicated that the company's long products operations were showing improvement. Dahlman Rose has a $26 PT and Buy rating on STLD STLD is trading lower at $18"
2011-02-14,Goldman Sachs Reiterates Steel Dynamics Buy (STLD),"Goldman Sachs reiterated its Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) Buy rating in a research report published today. Goldman Sachs has previously given Steel Dynamics shares a price target of $23. In the report, Goldman Sachs states, Recent drop in scrap prices has created some anxiety among investors that steel prices could follow. In our view, it is too early to throw in the towel, as we have just entered the seasonally strong demand period and global cost curve is yet to rise in 2Q, which should force global prices to rise further, thus giving support to the US price. In fact, the US mills have made yet another attempt to raise prices further and metal spreads have reached historical highs. Recent macro data such as the industrial production and ISM point to strong demand in the near term. Shares of Steel Dynamics were trading at $18.63 in pre-market trading at the time of posting, down 1.03% from Friday's market close."
2011-02-18,"Goldman Sachs Comments On Steel Industry (STLD, X)","Goldman Sachs is encouraged by the strong January 2011 service center data released on February 17, underpinning our view of strength in steel demand as evidenced by the recent macro indicators. Monthly shipments from service centers rose 33% YoY to 3.4 mn tons, which represents a significant jump from December and lends confidence that positive momentum is starting to emerge. The improvement in shipments is substantial and although some of the gains could be attributed to pre-buying ahead of anticipated price increases, Goldman believes that underlying demand has also improved markedly. On a historical basis, the 33.4% month increase in daily shipments was formidable when compared with the 14.3% it saw in December. Goldman expects the positive demand trend will continue into the next few months, which is generally a seasonally strong period. Combined with the added usual seasonal tailwind, Goldman expects 2Q2011 to be comparable if not even stronger than 1Q2011. Goldman expects that Steel Dynamics's (NASDAQ: STLD) ability to generate solid margins should help the companies sustain momentum into the second half. A recovery in demand should enable US Steel (NYSE: X) to increase its utilization rate and average about 85% in 2011, which is a significant increase from 76% last year. Goldman has a Buy rating on STLD & X STLD closed Thursday at $20.46 X closed Thursday at $63.64"

In a note to clients, Dahlman writes, Freeport McMoRan, Nucor, Steel Dynamics and Southern Copper released quarterly earnings results and BHP Billiton released its quarterly production report Nucor and Steel Dynamics handily beat our and the consensus earnings estimates as both companies benefited from high steel prices and improving demand and were able to partially offset higher raw material costs through their metals recycling businesses. Increased copper, gold and molybdenum production due to higher than anticipated ore grades at Grasberg and stronger demand in the molybdenum sector led to a substantial quarterly earnings beat for Freeport McMoRan. Southern Copper's earnings fell below our and the consensus estimates due to declining ore grades across a majority of the company's mines and a large increase in operating costs. In its production report, BHP Billiton showed strong iron ore production despite adverse weather conditions and planned maintenance work, but indicated that flooding in Queensland will affect met coal production for the remainder of the 2011 calendar year and that Gulf of Mexico permitting delays will lead to lower petroleum product production (ex-Fayetteville shale acquisition) in 2012."

2011-05-17,Techs Drag  05-17-2011,"Cusick's Corner The Bulls have the Buck, UUP, finishing the After Hours at the worst levels of the day. Tech, QQQQ, was the drag as earnings came in strong but forecasts were guided down for future quarters. Finance, XLF, finished the day at its best levels, taking some of the pressure off of the big banks, for now. So the market firmed into the After Hours but I am still skeptical, and I will be watching the crude inventories out after the open to see if the Energies and Crude will continue the recent downside push. Note, I did not get filled on my 1X2 spread I discussed at the Midday, never hit my price and I am not one to chase a market. See you Midday. Stocks battled back from early losses and finished mixed Tuesday. Trading was somewhat volatile at the opening bell after a report showed Housing Starts falling to an annual rate of 523K in April, which was down from 585K the month before and significantly worse than the 563K that economists had expected. A separate report released later showed Industrial Production unchanged in April. Economists were expecting an increase of .5 percent. Meanwhile, Hewlett Packard (HPQ) shares shed 7.3 percent and weighed down the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the company reported second quarter profits that beat Street estimates, but then offered lower guidance for the third quarter and full year. Walmart (WMT) also slipped on profit news, but Home Depot (HD) saw post earnings strength. At the end of the day, HP's big percentage loss was too much to overcome and the Dow finished down 68 points. However, the industrial average finished 101 points off session lows and the tech-heavy NASDAQ erased early losses to close with a .9-point gain. Bullish BB&T (BBT), a Winston-Salem, North Carolina regional bank was the subject of an interesting spread trade today. Shares added 42 cents to $57.09 and one strategist apparently bought 7,000 January 2013 $30 calls at $2.29 per contract and sold 15,000 January 2013 January 35 calls at $1. This looks like a call spread at a ratio of a little more than 2-to-1 and a bet that shares will rally through January 2013, but not necessarily beyond $35. US Bancorp (USB) saw a similar ratio spread in the January 2013 call options. An investor apparently bought 10,000 January 2013 $30 to calls at $1.58 and sold 20,000 January 2013 $35 calls at 65 cents. USB added 54 cents to $25.59 on the session. Bullish trading was also seen in Jack In the Box (JACK), Kinross Gold (KGC), and Steel Dynamics (STLD). Bearish The woes continue for United Rentals (URI). Shares of the Greenwich, CT rental and leasing services company lost 89 cents to $25.06. Shares are on a five-day losing skid and have now tumbled 28 percent from the 52-week high set on April 6. Some investors seem concerned about additional downside in URI before the weekend. 4,000 puts and 250 calls traded in the name today. May 24 puts, which are 4.2 percent OTM and expire at the end of the week, were the most actives. 2,545 traded and, with 85 percent trading at the ask, it appears that put buyers were driving the flow. May 25 and 26 puts were busy as well. It's not clear what was driving the increased short-term bearish trading in United Rentals today. Earnings were last reported on April 19. Bearish flow also surfaced in Chesapeake (CHK), Ciena (CIEN), and CIT Group (CIT). Index Trading Trading volume picked up in the index market Tuesday. 708,000 calls and 808,000 puts traded across the S&P 500 Index (.SPX), S&P 100 Index (.OEX) and other cash indexes, which is 1.4X the recent average daily volume for the index market, according to Trade Alert data. The S&P 500 finished little changed around 1,329. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) lost .69 to 17.55 and might have been distorted a bit by the options expiration. VIX May options expire tomorrow and the last day to trade the May contract was today. A settlement value will be computed Wednesday morning. Meanwhile, 334,000 calls and 126,000 puts traded on the volatility index. May 19 calls and May 17 puts, which are expiring worthless, were the day's most actives. More than 50,000 contracts traded in each. ETF Action iShares Emerging Markets Fund (EEM) battled back from morning losses to close the day up 15 cents to $47 even. 49,000 calls and 193,000 puts traded in the ETF. One noteworthy spread surfaced in morning trading when an investor bought 50,000 July 45 puts at $1.35 and sold 50,000 July 40 puts at 35 cents on the fund. They paid $1 per spread for the massive position and are possibly anticipating increased volatility in the emerging markets in the weeks ahead.

It is bullish on Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), Schnitzer Steel (NASDAQ: SCHN), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Reliance Steel (NYSE: RS) & Metals USA Holdings Corp (NYSE: MUSA). In a note to clients, Goldman writes, We see five reasons to be short term tactically positive on the steel sector: (1) the steel price decline appears to have halted at a reasonably high level; (2) raw material prices, particularly scrap, are defying the typical seasonal pattern and have either increased or remained relatively stable, thus providing cost support; (3) demand appears to be stable and early signs are that auto production could be stable in (seasonally slow) summer months as automobile parts supply chain has gradually recovered from the Japan earthquake; (4) inventories at the service center and end users are low which should keep order rates steady, and (5) steel stocks have significantly corrected and are down around 25% since mid-February compared to S&P down 7%. We believe that commentaries from the companies during their 2Q conference calls are likely to point to some optimism."

2011-07-05,Time For Steel ,"Higher iron ore prices haven't been very kind to global steel producers as of late. Higher production costs have caused several major steel producers to warn on earnings for the second quarter. The latest was Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), which said its second-quarter earnings per share would be about 22 cents less than what Wall Street is expecting. Overall, margins and gross profits for major steelmakers have not followed record steel prices higher. However, now may be the best time for investors to jump into the sector. Long term trends for steel demand are rosy as emerging markets continue to build out their infrastructure. Even in the developed world, steel demand is growing. The World Steel Association estimates that global finished steel consumption will rise 5.3% in 2011. Many analysts are bullish on the sector, citing that the long slump in steel prices is starting to bottom out. Morgan Stanley in a recent research note, said “We think [steel] market fundamentals will begin to turn up by the end of the summer, so any further weakness would be short-lived” and that a “ sector-wide recovery is coming closer.” In addition, many steel producers have begun raising prices for a variety of rolled steel products including rebar and I-beams. For investors, now may be the best time to add the sector to portfolio. Both the PowerShares Global Steel (NASDAQ: PSTL) and Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) offer direct access to the sector and feature some of the world's biggest steel producers. Investors can also use the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (NYSE: XME) which features a 31% weighting to steel."

2011-08-29,Will this Rally Blow Over?  08-26-2011,"Cusick's Corner The market has continued to stay firm into the close and now looks setting up a potential challenge for upside next week. Looking at the S&Ps, I will be watching 1180 as a level that which would signal two things - the subsiding of the selling pressure and a breakout to the upside of the narrowing consolidation we have been experiencing. If we get some poor news out of the EU this weekend, the selling pressure could ramp and break the lower end of this narrowing channel - 1140 on the S&P. I am not getting too caught up in this current uptrend, I am too much of a skeptic and the overall trend is still Bearish. And at this stage there is just too much mixed economic and headline risk and the price action still has not confirmed a real low. This is why I am treating this as a bounce and not a trend reversal. If the price action continues with strength in the form of volume pop and volatility crush, then bears should be on alert. For those of you in the Boston area - we are going to hold a workshop Saturday at the WESTIN WALTHAM, Come on Irene. See you next week. Stock market averages finished with gains on another seesaw session Friday. Stock index futures were under water before the opening bell on Wall Street after data showed Gross Domestic Product increasing at a 1 percent annual rate in the second quarter. Economists were looking for a 1.1 percent increase. Separate data released later showed the Univ of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index at 55.7 in late-August, up from an initial reading of 54.9 and below economist estimates of 55.8. Comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke came into focus around 9:00 central time. Stocks sold off after Bernanke signaled no new stimulus measures when speaking to an audience at a highly-anticipated meeting in Jackson Hole, WY. However, the Fed head also said that the September meeting will be held over two days instead of one and officials will discuss other policy options at that time. Stock market averages found floor through mid-morning and a rally ensued into midday. From that point forward, things slowed and market action was uneventful. At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had added 135 points on the day and 4.3 percent on the week. Today's Bullish Trading General Electric (GE) shares added .6 percent to $15.54 and were among 27 of the Dow thirty to move higher Friday. Noteworthy options trades in GE today include a ratio risk-reversal. In this trade, the strategist sold 22,500 January $11 put at 39 cents and bought 15,000 January 19 calls at 23 cents. In essence, they were writing downside puts to buy upside calls, in a ratio of 3-to-2. A small debit was paid and will be lost if the position is held through the January expiration and shares hold between the two strikes. At that point, both contracts expire worthless and the debit is lost. If shares fall below $11 (-29.2 percent) the strategist could face assignment on the puts and be asked to buy the stock at that price. In the best-case scenario, shares rally, the puts expire in worthless, and the calls appreciate in value. Bullish trading was also seen in Collective Brands (PSS), Quicksilver Resources (KWK), and Steel Dynamics (STLD). Today's Bearish Trading Harbin Electric (HRBN) shares were relatively weak and options volume picked up in the Chinese industrial equipment maker today. HRBN lost $2.02 to $15.08 and is on the three-day 17.5 percent losing skid. The stock came under pressure Wednesday after a blog post suggested that the company falsified documents. Although executives have been out defending the company and reiterated plans to take Harbin private at $24 per share, the stock remains under pressure. Meanwhile, today's options volume in HRBN included 37,000 calls and 39,000 puts. The top trade was a 6,100-contract block of December 17.5 puts, sold just after the opening bell at $3 per contract. The timing of this premium sale seems good, as the market is now $2.40 to $2.80. Sep 9 puts, Sep 12.5 puts, Sep 19 calls and Oct 13 puts were among the most actives in HRBN as well. Bearish flow also surfaced in Star Scientific (CIGX), Autozone (AZO), and Tiffany (TIF). Index Recap Trading remained active in the index market ahead of the weekend. 1 million puts and 670k calls traded across the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) NASDAQ 100 Index (.NDX), and other cash indexes. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) lost 4.17 to 35.59 on the day and gave up 17.3 percent on the week. VIX Sep 27.5 puts were today's most actively traded index contract. 111,825 traded. The top trade was a 6000-contract block traded on the 75-cent bid. This appears to be a premium seller and perhaps a bet that the market's fear gauge won't dip back to the mid-20s any time soon. September options on the volatility index expire in 25 days. Sep 25 puts, Sep 30 puts and Sep 32.5 calls on the index were actively traded today as well. Analyzing the ETF Market SPDR Homebuilders ETF (XHB) options were actively traded today. Shares finished up 42 cents to $14.31 and today's volume of 20,000 calls and 17,000 puts is about 4X the average daily for the homebuilder ETF. The top trade was part of a straddle write. That is, the investor sold 13,100 September 14 puts at 66 cents and sold 13,100 September 14 calls at 61 cents. $1.27 was collected on each straddle and probably closes out a position opened on 8/12 when the straddle was being bought at $1.52 and $1.59. Shares are up about 20 cents since that time, but the magnitude of the move has not been enough to offset the negative impact from time decay. Falling implied volatility is also a factor. Implied volatility in XHB options has eased about 5 percent during that time. In short, the position is being closed out at a loss because the options have lost value due to time decay and falling implied volatility - which are the two key risks to consider for straddle and strangle purchases."

2011-10-05,TARP EU  10-05-2011,"Cusick's Corner Shake out. That's what we saw on the close last night -- weak shorts were washed out on the news that TARPEU is now a potential reality. While the market has held the upside into the Midday, we have to respect the fact that this is a BEAR market. I like the action at this stage, a solid bid with volume and now breaking critical resistance, 1125 most notable level on the S&Ps. I said a few weeks ago that I felt the directional velocity and risk was to the upside and we are seeing it. For me to shift from the Bear trend, I would want to see that 1200-1225 level broken. Until then I am treating this as a respectable bounce catalyzed by the headlines and weak short being squeezed. See you After Hours. Stock market averages are holding gains with help from economic news Wednesday. Data released before the opening bell showed the US economy adding 91,000 private sector jobs last month. Economists were expecting the ADP report to show an increase of 45,000. The ISM Services Index was released later. The gauge of nationwide economic activity outside of manufacturing slipped to 53 in September, but that was not as bad as the 52.8 that was expected. Solid gains across the Eurozone, which included a 4.9 percent surge in Germany's DAX, helped set a positive tone for trading on Wall Street as well. However, ran out of steam in morning action and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 5 points at midday. The tech-heavy NASDAQ is up 20 points. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) eased back 1.40 points to 39.42. Overall options volume is well off of yesterday's pace, with 4.8 million calls and 4.4 million puts traded across the exchanges through 12:15pm ET. Bullish Flow Yahoo (YHOO) shares are up and options are actively traded on reports the company is sending out financial information to private equity firms and other possible bidders. Shares gained 43 cents to $14.89 on buyout hopes and options volume on Yahoo through midday includes 205,000 calls and 60,000 puts. The top trades are part of a three-way spread, in which the strategist sold 21,500 November 15 calls on Yahoo at $1.51 and bought the November 16 - 17 call spread at 35 cents, 11000X. This might be a roll and closing out a position in the November at-the-money calls after the stock's three-day 13.2 percent rally. The same investor is apparently taking a new position in the spread and looking for the rally to continue through mid-November. Steel Dynamics (STLD) shares added 34 cents to $10.48 and have now rallied almost 20 percent from a 52-week low of $8.78 set intraday yesterday. Prior to Tuesday, shares of the steelmaker had suffered a 40.2 percent loss since July. Some players in the options market seem to be anticipating additional gains in the weeks ahead, as call activity is picking up in the name. Today's volume of 3,510 calls and 550 puts is about 3X the norm for STLD. November 10 calls, which are now 48 cents in-the-money, are the most actives. 2,040 traded against 304 in open interest. 97 percent of the flow has traded at the ask, indicating buying interest. November 11 and 12 calls on STLD are seeing interest as well. Bearish Flow El Paso (EP) shares are trading down and puts on the natural gas producer are actively traded today. Shares are off 19 cents to $17.36 and 19,850 put options have traded on the stock, which is 8X the average daily put volume. The activity includes a buyer of 13,970 January 12.5 puts at 60 cents per contract. 17,640 traded against 4,478 in open interest. Natural gas prices are down today and have fallen more than 25 percent May. Some investors might be buying puts on EP on concerns falling commodity prices will hurt the company's shares and earnings in the months ahead. A bearish ratio spread trades on the iShares Long-term Bond Fund (TLT) today. The ETF, which holds a basket of longer-term Treasuries, is down $1.04 to $121.40 following better than expected jobs data. Bonds are lower and one strategist seems to expect the weakness to continue over the next two weeks. The investor bought 11,000 October 120 puts on TLT at $2.20 and sold 33,000 October 112 puts at 33 cents. In other words, an Oct 120 - 112 (1X3) put ratio spread was initiated for a $1.21 net debit. The spread will offer its best payoff if shares fall another 9.4 percent to $112 over the next 16 days. It might be a play on Friday's jobs data. The debit is at risk if bonds rally and shares hold above $120 through the expiration. There is additional risk to the downside, as the strategist is short three puts that every put that was purchased. SPDR Oil Exploration and Production (XOP) options volume is running 3X the (22-day) average, with 74,000 contracts traded and put activity accounting for 69 percent of the volume. Unusual Volume Williams Companies (WMB) options volume is 2.5X the average daily, with 53,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 88 percent of the activity. AMD options volume is running 3X the average daily, with 46,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 71 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Omnivision Technologies (OVTI), El Paso (EP), and Akamai (AKAM). Implied Volatility Mover Research In Motion (RIMM) is rallying and implied volatility in options on the Blackberry-marker is up today after an article in UK Independent suggested that Vodafone (VOD) might be interested in RIM. Shares jumped $2.88 to $23.88. Options order flow includes 126,000 calls and 66,000 puts. November 20 calls are the most actives, with 11,800 traded. Meanwhile, implied volatility in options on the stock jumped 16 percent and is elevated at 94."
2011-10-05,Resistance  10-05-2011,"Cusick's Corner Resistance -- there's been an impressive bounce but there is a ton of upside resistance at the 1141 level on the S&Ps, and I want to see this level broken before I position to the upside with any conviction. I would call this prudence or respect. I did like the ADP report, but there is just too much fog around the EU's next actions concerning the bailouts (aka TARP EU). Watch the Claims data out pre-market, if they come in below the psychological 400K level, the market might garner some steam potentially to the upside and especially if the under invested gets nervous. See you Midday. Stock market averages finished higher for a second day. The day after the Dow Jones Industrials rallied 154 points and finished more than 400 points off session lows, benchmarks moved sharply higher across the Eurozone. A 4.9 percent rally in Germany's DAX paced the advance and strength overseas helped set a positive tone for early trading in the US. On the economic front, ADP reported that 91,000 private sector jobs were created last month. Economists were expecting the ADP report to show an increase of 45,000 and the strong number comes two days before the Labor Department releases its key jobs data. The ISM Services Index was released this morning as well. The gauge of nationwide economic activity outside of manufacturing slipped to 53 in September, but that was not as bad as the 52.8 that was expected. The gains overseas and better-than-expected economic data helped send stocks higher early. The Dow then drifted into negative territory at midday, but moved higher again in afternoon action. At the closing bell, the Dow had added another 131 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ was up 55.7. Bullish Yahoo (YHOO) shares rallied Wednesday. In the midday update, we noted that shares were up in morning action after the company said it was sending financial information to private equity firms and other potential bidders. Buyout hopes had helped send shares up 43 cents to $14.89 amid a flurry of options activity. The rally in shares gathered additional momentum in afternoon action after Reuters reported that Microsoft (MSFT) might bid for the Internet giant. At the end of the day, shares were up $1.46 to $15.92. Options volume in Yahoo had surged to 560,000 contracts and 3.5X the daily average. 447,000 calls traded on the Internet company, including heavy trading in October and November 15, 16 and 17 calls. Bullish trading was also seen in Corinthian Colleges (COCO), Steel Dynamics (STLD), and Cemex (CX). Bearish Nabors Industries (NBR) shares rallied $1.10 to $13.42 on a good day for the drillers after crude tallied its best one-day gain since May. With help from bullish weekly inventory data, crude gained $4.23 to $79.90 per barrel. Meanwhile, NBR is now up 21.5 percent from a 52-week low of $11.05 set intraday yesterday. Today's options volume on the Bermudian oil and gas driller rose to 2.5X the daily average after 14,000 puts and 5,200 calls traded on the stock. The top trades were part of a spread, in which the strategist sold 4,200 Jan13 $10 puts at $2.20 and bought 8,400 Jan13 $5 puts at 59 cents. In other words, $1.02 was collected on this Jan13 10 - 5 (2X1) put ratio backspread. If this is a new position, the strategist keeps the credit if shares hold above $10 through the January 2013 expiration and all the options expire worthless. Profits from the backspread are also possible if shares make a substantial move below the $5 strike. However, the 1X2 might also be rolling - or closing out a position in the Jan13 10 puts after a 56.2 percent plunge in shares since April. A new position is being bought-to-open in the Jan13 $5 puts. Bearish trading was also seen in El Paso (EP), American Axle (AXL) and Cigna (CI). Index Trading S&P 500 PM Settled Index (.SPXPM) options are beginning to see some interest. Options on the index started trading this week and, in contrast to pit-traded S&P 500 index (.SPX) options, which have a settlement value computed on Friday morning before the expiration, the all-electronic SPXPM has an afternoon settlement. SPXPM options are based off the S&P 500 Index, which rallied 20.08 points to 1,144.03 today. Meanwhile, 1,673 contracts traded on the SPXPM Index today. October 1,200 calls were the most actives. 1,017 traded and some investors seemed to be selling the contract, possibly betting that SPX won't recover beyond 1,200 through the October expiration - which is in 16 days for the PM settled index and 15 days for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) options. ETF Action SPDR Energy Fund (XLE), which is an exchange-traded fund that holds all of the energy-related names from the S&P 500, added $2.15 to $60.52 after crude oil rose more than $4 and had its best one-day gain since May. Options volume in XLE hit 2X the daily average, with 132,000 calls and 36,000 puts traded in the product. The top trades were part of a ratio spread, in which the strategist sold 28,000 October 63 calls at 92 cents and bought 18,000 October 60 calls at $2.19. It's probably a roll. That is, the investor is selling the Oct 63 calls and giving up hopes for rally beyond $63 through the October expiration - 16 days. However, they are maintaining a bullish position in the sector by purchasing a smaller position of at-the-money October calls."

2011-12-16,UPDATE: Steel Dynamics Guides Q4 EPS $0.08-0.12 vs $0.17 Est,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) today announced that its board of directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share. The dividend is payable on or about January 13, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 31, 2011. The company also expects fourth quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.12 per diluted share, higher than fourth quarter 2010 earnings of $0.04 per diluted share, but lower than third quarter 2011 earnings of $0.19 per diluted share, primarily due to an estimated 25% drop in anticipated fourth quarter flat rolled earnings and an estimated $10 million reduction in earnings from the company's liquid iron production facility, Iron Dynamics (IDI). The reduction in fourth quarter IDI earnings was attributable to a planned three week shutdown during October and November for the relining of the facility's submerged arc furnace, resulting in an anticipated 20% decrease in quarterly shipments and increased expenses of just over $3 million related to the project. Iron Dynamics achieved a time span of two years since the previous relining, a record. Flat rolled demand during October and the first part of November was weaker, and early in the quarter pricing remained a challenge, reducing anticipated volumes. Additionally, the cost of raw materials consumed did not decline in step with realized flat rolled steel prices, which resulted in reduced fourth quarter anticipated margins. As increases in order entry and pricing occurred late in the fourth quarter, these positive factors did not materially impact fourth quarter performance, but are expected to be beneficial to the first quarter of 2012. Overall, continued uncertainty within the U.S. and global economies continues to impact corporate and consumer spending, resulting in a challenging demand environment. However, demand improvement is occurring in the energy, construction equipment, agricultural, and automotive sectors. The company believes if more stability develops into next year demand could be expected to increase, along with steel pricing and margins."

2011-12-30,Could Steel Be A Steal?,"Sparrows Point in Baltimore County, Maryland, once housed the world's largest steel mill. However, times have changed, and just recently RG Steel announced that it would be laying off over 700 employees at its Sparrows Point plant. RG Steel, a private company, bought the plant last spring as part of a deal that cost the company $1.2 billion. GE Capital, a division of General Electric (NYSE: GE), loaned RG Steel $750 million to help complete the deal. The recent layoffs were precipitated by internal changes within GE Capital designed to boost the financial services company's reserves, which has had severe negative effects on RG Steel's liquidity. The news of the layoffs sent shock waves throughout the steel industry. No one is sure exactly how this will affect sheet supply in the U.S. in the near-term future. That said, the U.S. steel market has been suffering from excess sheet supplies for some time. Bank of America and others have noted that RG Steel's troubles could be a boon for other steel companies. Below are four companies that could benefit from the partial shut down of RG Steel's Sparrows Point plant, most of which were hit quite hard earlier in the year: 1. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) Market Cap: $910.87 million P/E: - AK Steel is a midwest-based company that produces electrical and stainless steels, including steel for automakers. The company's stock is down almost 50% year-to-date, but it appears that it may be poised for a rebound. Just recently, AK Steel announced a $50 per ton price increase for carbon steel products. However, if the company's stock does see a dramatic rise, this would hurt the shares' yields, which are currently attractive at 2.42%. 2. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) Market Cap: $3.81 billion P/E: - United States Steel is one of the world's top steel companies, and is capable of producing over 30 million net tons of raw steel annually. Like AK Steel, United States Steel is down over 50% year-to-date. That said, the company's stock has been on the rise over the last couple of months, a general trend in the steel market. Strong car sales would help the company. 3. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) Market Cap: $2.88 billion P/E: 11.68 Steel Dynamics is both a steel producer and metal recycler. The company announced its expected fourth quarter earnings this month, pegging earnings at $0.08 to $0.12 a share. That's higher than last year's fourth quarters earning, but lower than their third quarter 2011 earnings. The company also declared a $0.10 dividend per common share. The stock closed Friday at $13.15, and has a $20.70 52 week high. 4. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) Market Cap: $12.53 billion P/E: 20.01 Nucor Corporation produces steel and steel products, and is heavily involved in the manufacturing of sheet steel. The company shares are down only 9.7% year-to-date, which is a significantly stronger performance than the other companies in this list. While this is a positive, it suggests that the company may not have as much potential as a buy low “steal” as the other companies mentioned. However, it's as poised as any other steel company to benefit from RG Steel's troubles. Bullish View:Traders who believe that news on RG Steel will improve inventory turnover in the steel industry may want to consider the following: Go long on the aforementioned companies via shares or call options.Buy into Market Vectors Steel Index ETF (SLX), or perhaps PowerShares Global Steel Portfolio (PSTL) for traders that believe the news will have broader global implications. Bearish View:Traders who believe that the news on RG Steel won't improve inventory turnover in the steel industry might consider the following:Short the companies listed above, which may be a good play if demand for steel is low.Short Market Vectors Steel Index ETF and other steel ETFs, or pursue options strategies to hedge current investment.Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-12-30,"Bank of America Views Sparrows Point Shutdown as Potentially Positive for AKS, X, STLD, NUE","Bank of America published a research report on yesterday on US Steel, noting that private RG Group's recent shutdown at Sparrows Point could be potentially positive for other companies in the steel sector. In the report, Bank of America writes, Media reports over the long holiday weekend indicate RG Group's 3M+ t/yr Sparrows Point at least partly shut operations and issued layoff notices to employees. The mill was reportedly struggling to pay bills despite rising steel prices and lower iron ore prices in recent months. Customers we spoke with were still unclear on the status of existing orders. Sparrows may be still shipping to them, but if not, the market could tighten as buyers scramble to replace tons they had ordered. A permanent or even temporary closure of the mill, also called the “Beast from the East,” can likely help balance the oversupplied U.S. flat-rolled market. Bank of America goes on to say that, Concern over excess sheet supply in the U.S. market has been one of our main reasons for being cautious on producers such as U.S. Steel, AK Steel, and Steel Dynamics, although we have also been wary of stretched balance sheets and pension issues. Recent price hikes would take benchmark hot rolled coil (HRC) sheet prices up about $150/short ton to at least $740-750/t. Our forecast remains at $740/t for H1 2012. We think the removal of Sparrows' extra tons can help support the recent price hikes, at least through the next several months. Attractively priced imported tons offered from Russia, Italy, and Korea at more than $100/t below domestic prices are available for late February and March, but until then we see potential outperformance from the group. Higher iron ore prices and a weaker dollar can be positive, while the opposite can pressure steel prices.

2012-01-04,Bank of America Upgrades Steel Dynamics to Buy,Bank of America has upgraded Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) from Neutral to Buy and has raised the price target from $16 to $17.
2012-01-04,UPDATE: Bank of America Upgrades Steel Dynamics to Buy,"Bank of America has published a research report on Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) and has upgraded the company from Neutral to Buy based on the recent lagging performance of the stock. In the report, Bank of America writes, We upgrade Steel Dynamics to Buy from Neutral as the stock has lagged and market conditions are poised to improve at least near term. A higher January scrap price should benefit its OmniSource scrap division, and rising prices for its 50-60% sheet steel exposure especially help it given FIFO accounting and generally short lead times. Steel buyers tell us mini mills are scooping up orders in place of the recent idling or closure of the more than 3Mt/yr capacity Sparrows Point furnace. The closure comes in a typically seasonally strong time of year, in which disruptions historically can help further strengthen the steel market. We believe recent price hikes stick, at least through Q1. Current HRC prices are $700-720/t, but could ultimately reach $740-760 or higher in the near term. Low- priced imports, especially from Russia and Korea, remain a longer-term risk. Bank of America has also raised the price objective from $16 to $17 on Steel Dynamics, which is currently trading up $0.14 from yesterday's $14.03 closing price."

2012-01-18,Bank of America Positive on US Steel Sector,"Bank of America has published a research report on the US Steel Sector after reports show that December distribution shipments have fallen. In the report, Bank of America writes, Dec steel shipments fell 14.7% daily compared with a historical 12.7% m/m decline. Flat-rolled and plate shipments fell the most of the carbon products, down 16.6% and 13.4% respectively on a days-adj basis m/m. Tubular shipments fell the least, down 7.7% m/m. Stainless steel shipments fell 15.8% m/m but were up 4.6% y/y. Weak stainless demand has been an overhang on U.S. producers ATI and AKS but we anticipate restocking in 2012 given the low I/S ratio. Meanwhile, aluminum shipments fell 13.8% m/m on a days-adj basis but were up 13.1% y/y. Steel market mixed signals have confused investors as the Sparrows Point mill idled and is restarting and scrap rose then retreated again. However, we still expect the group to outperform near term as we think investor expectations are too low and upcoming Q1 outlooks should be quite positive. Sparrows should take time to restart, and scrap is just correcting to a still elevated level given the mild winter. Any weather-related disruption or Chinese rebound after its easing could further strengthen the steel thesis.

2012-01-24,Steel Stocks Refuse To Bend,"This afternoon, all of the leading steel stocks are holding up very well. The strength in the steel sector is partly coming from a weaker U.S. Dollar Index.

Leading steel stocks such as U.S. Steel Corp (NYSE: X), Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE), AK Steel Holdings Corp (NYSE: AKS), and Steel Dynamics Inc (NASDAQ: STLD) remain strong on the daily charts. These stocks look as if they could have a little more upside in the near term. It is important for traders to realize that U.S. Steel Corp (NYSE: X) is the leading stock in this industry group.

Operating income missed our (pre-guidance) forecast (-10%) due to mostly to greater than expected impact from a planned furnace reline at Iron Dynamics, though below-the-line items offset. STLD's outlook was generally positive calling for improving demand across most key end markets and better pricing.

2012-01-25,Goldman Sachs Maintains Neutral on Steel Dynamics' 4Q Earnings Beat,"Goldman Sachs has published a research report yesterday on Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) after the company reported a 4Q earnings beat. In the report, Goldman Sachs writes, STLD reported a net profit of $0.14 per share for 4Q2011 compared to our estimate of $0.10 and consensus of $0.11. The results were above the guidance range (issued on December 16) of $0.08-$0.12. However, there was a $0.01 benefit from lower taxes and another $0.01 benefit from lower share count. STLD is cautiously optimistic on 2012 and expects more stable end markets with improvements from energy, agriculture, auto and construction. The company expects that increased order entry and pricing will benefit 1Q12. We are at $0.34 for 1Q vs. consensus of $0.33.

2012-01-25,Bank of America Maintains Buy on Steel Dynamics After 4Q Earnings,"Bank of America has published a research report on Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) after the company reported above consensus EPS for its 4Q. In the report, Bank of America writes, Management's outlook comments in the press release were limited, except to say that it was optimistic and to highlight opportunity for greater stability in 2012 and market sectors showing particular strength. It detailed an expected $10M charge in Q1 related to its term loan refinancing, but expected an offsetting $9M of interest cost savings later in 2012. We expect further details on its outlook on its conference call, but it's possible the new CEO, who began as of 2012, will adopt a more cautious tone that could be misinterpreted as deteriorating STLD prospects. We find STLD well positioned to benefit from rising prices in recent months. Bank of America maintains its Buy rating and $17 price objective on Steel Dynamics, which is currently trading up $0.63 from yesterday's $15.46 closing price."

2012-02-03,Economic Optimism Propels Strong January For Steel Stocks,"Better than expected economic numbers along with improving sentiment about the prospects of the global economy helped steel stocks to post strong returns in January. One of the strongest performers in the sector over the last month has been Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), which has risen better than 17%. The company released its earnings report on January 24, beating analysts' consensus earnings per share estimates by $0.04. In the wake of this strong report, STLD shares have continued to gain momentum. Another strong performer in the steel sector has been Nucor (NYSE: NUE). That stock is up better than 12% over the last month and has been rising nearly every day. Although over the last 52-weeks, NUE shares are still down around 6%, the stock has been in a strong uptrend over the last 6 months, with the trend accelerating in January. Nucor released a strong quarterly earnings report on January 26, with EPS handily beating analysts' consensus, which appears to have buoyed optimism about the company's forward looking prospects. In January, global steel producer ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) also saw its share price rise. The stock has gained a little less than 10% over the last month, although shares are still down more than 40% versus a year ago. Shares closed Friday's trading session at $21.74 which compares to a 52-week high in the name of $38.50. If the consensus outlook for the global economy continues to improve, look for MT's recent uptrend to accelerate as the year progresses. The stock trades at a trailing P/E of 14.44, a forward P/E of 9.66 and a PEG ratio of 0.54 - on a valuation basis, this name looks relatively inexpensive. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) shares also posted strong gains in January and have risen more than 14% over the last month. Like the other steel names, the last 52-weeks have been disappointing, with the stock down almost 47%, but the trend has definitely turned up in X. Furthermore, the rally could gain steam in February if sentiment and the broader market cooperate. U.S. Steel (X) has a very large short interest, with almost 24% of the company's float sold short, and a short-squeeze is definitely a possibility if traders begin to conclude that the bottom is in for the steel sector and that the global economy is about to pick up steam. AK Steel (NSYE:AKS) has added 2.57% over the last month and has been a laggard among the steel stocks. Similar to U.S. Steel, however, AKS has a very large short interest (20.66%) and could benefit from short covering if the market continues to ramp higher. Both AKS and X would appear to be good candidates for traders looking to put on a high risk/reward trade that will benefit from a bullish future outlook for the domestic and international economy. Steel stocks are extremely sensitive to changes in sentiment, and the high short interest in these names could provide greater upside than some less shorted names in the event of a continued rally in the steel sector."

2012-02-16,Steel Dynamics to Expand Production of Special-Bar-Quality Steels ,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) today announced that its board of directors has approved an expansion of its Engineered Bar Products Division located in Pittsboro, Indiana. The expansion is intended to both increase the steel mill's capacity to produce special-bar-quality (SBQ) steel bars and to expand the mill's product offerings of high-quality small-diameter SBQ bars. The expansion is expected to increase the mill's overall annual production capacity from 625,000 tons to 950,000 tons, a 52 percent increase. Subject to the anticipated receipt of necessary permits, which the company expects to be forthcoming in short order, and the receipt of state and local government support, the project is scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2013 and to cost approximately $76 million. With this additional capacity, the company's Engineered Bar Products Division would be among the largest single-site SBQ production facilities in North America. The expansion includes numerous enhancements to the facility's rolling mill for the production of precision sized bars, as well as improvements in material handling and staging. The company also plans to expand the mill's bar finishing capabilities for non-destructive testing of finished bars, potentially doubling its inspection capacity."
2012-04-03,Trading Outlook: Steel Stocks,"While the outlook for the global steel industry as a whole has been steadily improving, the share performance of a number of prominent steel producers has been terrible over the last year. For example, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) has lost 45% over the last 52-weeks and ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) has fallen more than 48%. Among the best performing steel names has been Nucor (NYSE: NUE) which has seen its share price rebound along with the broader market in 2012. Nevertheless, NUE shares are still down 7.38% over the last year. Other prominent names include AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD). Both of these stocks remain under pressure, however, as AKS shares have lost more than 50% over the last 52-weeks and STLD is down nearly 23% during the same time period. The performance of these stocks comes despite the fact that world crude steel production hit another all-time record in 2011 with 1,527 million tons being produced for the year. The emergence of China has helped to spur demand for steel after a deep fall off in the wake of the global financial crisis. Not only is China the largest steel consumer, but it is also the largest producer by a wide margin, generating almost half of the world's output at 46% and growing 8.9% year over year. This compares to the United States which generated just 6% of global output in 2011 and was growing at a rate of 7.1%. Given the shifting global output and demand dynamics in the steel industry, the market remains significantly fragmented and highly competitive. In addition, steel stocks are very cyclical and some key markets remain under pressure. In particular, the industry is sensitive to demand from global automakers such as General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Toyota (NYSE: TM). Unsurprisingly, share price trends in these names reflect some of the weakness in prominent steel stocks. For example, Ford shares have lost more than 17% over the last year and GM has lost more than 21%. Taken on balance, however, the automaker segment is considerably stronger than the other major steel market which is construction. Coming out of the 2008 recession, the construction industry, and the housing market in particular, has failed to ramp back up to pre-crisis levels and considerable slack remains. This is witnessed by housing starts that continue to remain near historically low levels. While the current construction outlook remains uncertain, increased optimism and activity will be reflected in steel stocks. Given the depressed levels of many prominent names, these stocks could produce significant gains in 2012 if the lingering headwinds in the construction sector continue to show signs of abating. While uncertainty remains the primary theme, steel companies themselves are putting a positive spin on their outlook for 2012. The industry anticipates that volumes will improve in 2012 on recovering demand and a stronger global economy. Furthermore, operating results are expected to show a sharp improvement versus 2011 driven by higher selling prices and shipment volumes. The positive outlook, however, should be tempered by the knowledge that any kind of weakness or increased uncertainty in the global economy will have an immediate effect on the sector. In particular, fears over a slowing Chinese economy could be devastating for steel producers. Investors also should be aware of other headwinds such as persistently high raw material costs which steel producers have a difficult time passing on to customers amid a tepid demand backdrop. Furthermore, the steel industry continues to suffer from overcapacity, particularly in China. As a result, the world market has been flooded with cheap steel and this development has been a burden for U.S. producers. Despite the risks, however, the steel sector is very interesting given its sharp under-performance. As a result, buying steel stocks which are trading at relatively depressed levels may be one of the best ways to express an aggressively bullish thesis on the global economy. Because end markets for the industry are still under pressure despite a clear improvement in worldwide economic conditions, the sector has lagged most other areas of the market. If sentiment and economic growth were to continue to ramp sharply in the coming years, steel stocks could be among the best performers given current valuations."
2012-06-11,AK Steel Holdings Falls Sharply After Downgrade,"AK Steel Holdings (NYSE: AKS) has decreased about 13% on the session. As stated in a Wall Street Journal Article, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) downgraded AKS from a Neutral to a Sell rating. Goldman Sachs may have downgraded AKS because of a highly leveraged balance sheet, having $1.1 billion in debt compared to $576 million in equity. AKS only has $42 million in cash, making it difficult to pay off debt. According to a Wall Street Journal Article, Goldman Sachs stated, “Half way through 2012, it is becoming evident that this is shaping up to be a tough year for the steel sector, and 2H could get even tougher, especially for flat rolled products. China's daily steel output has decreased in May, which has led to a decrease in the demand for steel. The decrease of the price of steel in China could be having a negative effect on the steel sector and a contributing factor to the low prices in flat steel. Competitors of AKS such as, United States Steel (NYSE: X), Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), have all seen losses on the day. AK Steel Holdings is currently trading at about $5.06."

(NASDAQ: STLD) today provided second quarter earnings guidance in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share. Second quarter 2012 estimated results are somewhat lower than the $0.20 per diluted share reported for the first quarter 2012 (which included January refinancing charges of $0.03 per diluted share), and lower than the $0.43 per diluted share reported for the second quarter of 2011."
2012-06-18,Steel Stocks Announce Weak Guidance Amid Slowing Demand,"The steel industry continues to suffer from overcapacity, particularly in China. As a result, the world market has been flooded with cheap steel, burdening U.S. steel producers. End markets for the industry, including the auto industry, are still under pressure despite a clear improvement in worldwide economic conditions. As a result, the steel sector has lagged most other areas of the market year to date. So, investors should not be surprised that steel stocks are seeing increased pressure during Monday's trading session. On Friday after the market close, Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) announced weak second quarter guidance and, Monday morning, AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) also announced weak guidance. Steel Dynamics provided second quarter earnings guidance in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share, which was worse than analysts' consensus estimates of $0.24. These second quarter 2012 estimated results are somewhat lower than the $0.20 per diluted share reported for the first quarter 2012 (which included January refinancing charges of $0.03 per diluted share), and lower than the $0.43 per diluted share reported for the second quarter of 2011. The company stated that its somewhat weak guidance is primarily the result of decreased sheet steel pricing, attributable to supply-side pressures from increased imports and increased domestic steel capacity. However, the company also mentioned that sheet steel demand quantities are relatively stable, including strength in the automotive, energy, construction equipment and agricultural sectors. Monday morning, AK Steel said it expects to generate second quarter net income between $0.04 and $0.06 per diluted share, which is lower than analysts' consensus estimate of $0.11. The company stated that this soft guidance is due to increased uncertainty and volatility with respect to near-term economic conditions in the United States and in other markets served by the company, including a recent deterioration in spot market pricing. Shares of most steel companies traded down on the session; however, Steel Dynamics traded close to flat for the day. AK Steel traded down around 4.5%, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) traded down about 3.6%, and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) was down about 1.3%."

2012-06-18,UPDATE: Steel Dynamics Provides Q2 2012 Earnings Guidance: $0.15-0.20 vs $0.24 Est,"Steel Dynamics, Inc, (NASDAQ: STLD) Friday, provided second quarter earnings guidance in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share. Second quarter 2012 estimated results are somewhat lower than the $0.20 per diluted share reported for the first quarter 2012 (which included January refinancing charges of $0.03 per diluted share), and lower than the $0.43 per diluted share reported for the second quarter of 2011. Despite relatively stable sheet steel demand, including strength in the automotive, energy, construction equipment and agricultural sectors, the company's somewhat softer earnings estimate is primarily the result of decreased sheet steel pricing attributable to supply-side pressures from increased imports and increased domestic steel capacity."
2012-06-19,"Warnings Season is Here, These ETFs Could Suffer","In just a couple of weeks, second-quarter earnings season kicks into high gear, but the lull before those reports start rolling really is not a lull at all. Before earnings season, there is warnings seasons and investors have been enduring a spate of cautionary tales of sluggish profits for several weeks now. With the warnings spigot flowing hard and fast, several sectors are looking vulnerable to earnings disappointments. In some cases, that vulnerability increases by the day. Those looking to short ETFs that could potentially see more earnings warnings and/or low-quality earnings, should consider the following funds. iShares Dow Jones U.S. Oil Equipment & Services Index Fund (NYSE: IEZ) Earlier this month, Halliburton (NYSE: HAL), the world's second-largest provider of oilfield services, said it believes that its North America margins will be impacted 300 basis points more than its previous guidance of 200 to 250 basis points, for a total impact of 500-550 basis points lower than first quarter levels. The problem with a warning from a marquee oil services name like Halliburton is that it very well could mean more glum news from rivals is not far behind. Surprisingly, IEZ has traded higher since the Halliburton warning, but consider the catalyst for that warning. The company said the price of guar gum rose more rapidly than anticipated. Guar gum is a food ingredient, but it is used in hydraulic fracturing fluids. Translation: Halliburton is not the only IEZ constituent using guar gum and that probably means Halliburton is not the only oil services being pinched by rising prices for the material. Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) The Market Vectors Steel ETF has its hands full. The fund has plunged more than 22 percent over the past 90 days. Not only that, but since June 15, two SLX holdings, Steel Dynamics (Nasdaq: STLD) and AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) have issued profit warnings. Maybe that is no big deal since those stocks combine for just over five percent of SLX's weight. On the other hand, where there is smoke, there is usually fire. Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX), which combine for about 35% of XLE's weight, now how to turn a profit. Exxon has been frequently vilified in the court of public opinion for making too much money and that is almost certainly because the company produces oil, not iPads. Putting one's personal support or disdain for the oil business aside, it cannot be ignored that oil futures have traded lower in much of the second quarter this year than they did last year. There are no guarantees XLE's constituents will be issuing warnings, but it would not be all that surprising if Exxon, Chevron, Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) or comparable firms do tell investors to temper their expectations. Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO) Projecting earnings warnings from MOO holdings is a tough call to make, particularly because Agrium (NYSE: AGU) recently issued bullish guidance. On the other hand, the impact of rising natural gas on nitrogen fertilizer producers cannot be ignored. Natural gas is by no means in a bull market, at least not yet, but the commodity has started to show signs of life recently. That is not good news for a company like CF Industries (NYSE: CF), the largest U.S. nitrogen fertilizer maker. In the case of MOO, it must be noted the nitrogen fertilizer firms are just one part of this ETFs lineup and not the primary determinant of MOO's returns. Goldman Sachs is bullish on fertilizer names and raised its price target on CF to $230 from $225, which implies significant upside from current levels. Just do not make the mistake of looking natural gas futures. Since the start of June, the U.S. Natural Gas Fund is up almost 9%. CF is flat."

2012-09-17,"UPDATE: J.P. Morgan Reiterates Overweight Rating, Lowers PT on Steel Dynamics","In a report published Monday, J.P. Morgan & Co. reiterated its Overweight rating on Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), but slightly lowered its price target from $15.00 to $14.50. J.P. Morgan noted, “We rate STLD Overweight with a $14.50 price target. We continue to believe that STLD's stock is not accurately reflecting the earnings power of the company even at below normalized utilization rates, and think the benefits of the company's raw material cost initiatives will become more apparent as the Magnetation operation comes online. The company should also benefit from its more variable cost structure and lower scrap prices. Any rebound in non-residential construction could also provide a significant boost to the company's earnings as STLD's non-residential construction related steel businesses is still down roughly 60% since the 2005-2007 timeframe.” Steel Dynamics closed on Friday at $13.01."
2012-11-27,"Steel Dynamics' Structural, Rail Unit to Expand Production of Carbon Steel Rails","Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) today announced plans to install a state-of-the-art heat-treating system at its Columbia City, Indiana, Structural and Rail Division (SRD). When operational, the system will be capable of producing up to 350,000 tons of standard strength and head hardened plain, carbon steel rails for North America's railroad industry. Capital investments are estimated to be slightly less than $27 million. Site preparation will commence immediately with construction expected to begin in the first quarter of 2013. The company anticipates it will commission the system before the end of 2013. Production ramp-up is expected to continue through 2015, reaching full production of 350,000 tons in early 2016. This expansion is expected to create nearly forty (40) new, full time jobs. The company plans to locally-source much of the equipment, with a majority of the required materials carrying the Made in USA manufacturing marking. It is anticipated that the new rail capabilities will permit the Structural and Rail Division to become North America's pre-eminent rail manufacturer for rail quality, end straightness, and dimensional control. Unlike the company's domestic competitors, which produce 80 foot rail on less efficient, older technology, the company's new process will involve a modern universal mill capable of rolling high-quality 320-foot long rails. These longer rails will be cut to customer-required lengths or welded together into quarter-mile long strings utilizing only four, instead of nineteen, welds, using the company's existing state-of-the-art Continuous Rail Welding facility. By reducing the number of welds, this technologically advanced system will significantly reduce the potential for weld-related track issues, dramatically reduce associated production costs, and provide customers with the quality rail needed for 21^st Century rail systems."

2013-03-07,What's the Deal with Steel?,"Is steel a steal? If prices for the metal really are at a near-term bottom, then now might be a good time to consider adding some cold, hard steel to your portfolio. Longbow Research showed an interest in the sector on Wednesday and initiated coverage on four names in the steel space and upgraded another. If you’re into that sort of thing, there are plenty of articles that will take you through the fundamentals. Basically, if you’re looking for companies with a lot of debt, less than impressive margins and P/E’s so high that you scratch your head and ask why, you’re in the right place. But maybe these names look better from a technical perspective. Let’s see what the charts say about a few of the names that Longbow now has their eye on: First up is Nucor (NYSE: NUE). It’s one of Longbow’s favorites. They initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating. At the beginning of December, Nucor started an impressive move to the upside—nearly 20 percent. This caused a break out through the upper trend line of the ascending channel only to sell off modestly soon after. Then came a retest that formed a double top. The stock failed and sold off to the tune of 9 percent. The stock has since recovered, breaking through its 50 DMA on Wednesday. The stock looks ready to retest the $48.23 top. How about Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD)? If you bought this name back in June when it underperformed the S&P by as much as 25 percent, you’re feeling good about your stock picking abilities right now. It’s up 48 percent since its bottom and recently, a buying opportunity presented itself. Sell volume dried up causing the stock to shed 12 percent while still holding the lower trend line of the ascending channel. It’s currently testing the 20 DMA but the selloff might entice new buying interest if the broader market remains risk-off. Finally, the name that gets the most press in the steel space, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X). If you’re a volatility trader, look no further. Wild price moves aside, the name has only barely formed an ascending channel over the past six months—a red flag in a market that won’t do anything but keep rising. After a large gap higher at the beginning of the year, the stock plunged, breaking through its lower trend line in February. For now, this is a broken stock. U.S. Steel is below its 20, 50, and 200 moving averages and in a three month downtrend with sell volume showing no signs of drying up. Its next chance of gaining some momentum comes at the 200 DMA at $21.39 and then a test of the lower trend line right around $22."

2013-04-03,Big Problems For Steel ETF ,"Signs just keep on creeping up that the materials sector is in trouble and in today's episode of As Materials ETFs Tumble, the Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) is in the spotlight. On light volume, SLX is down 0.7 percent and while that may not sound like much, Wednesday's decline extends a woeful start to 2013 for SLX and the ETF is now flirting with a year-to-date loss of 18 percent. To put that performance into context, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), the worst-performing of the nine sector SPDRs in the first quarter, is still clinging to a year-to-date gain. SLX's problems are not hard to identify. Just start with the ETF's two largest holdings, Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) and Vale (NYSE: VALE). Those mining giants combine for over 26 percent of SLX's weight. Rio Tinto's U.S.-listed shares are off almost 24 percent year-to-date and things could get worse before they get better for the Australian mining giant. Not only are Australian exporters being crimped by a strong Australian dollar, but the central bank there expects the mining sector will peak later this year. The Reserve Bank of Australia has already noted that sectors beyond mining and materials must step up to help the world's 12th-largest economy. Then there is Brazil's Vale, the world's largest iron ore producer. Even with today's 2.4 percent pop, Vale's U.S. shares are off 20.5 percent this year. In the case of this stock, investors can debate what is worse: The company's status as the world's leading iron ore maker or the fact that Vale is a Brazilian firm. Brazil has given investors almost nothing to cheer about for over a year now and Vale is proving to be a drag on SLX and some other marquee ETFs as a result. Investors should not just pick on SLX's foreign holdings. In the past month, Nucor (NYSE: NUE) is off more than three percent. When accounting for the Wednesday plunges of more than three percent in both Allegheny Technologies (NYSE: ATI) and Timken (NYSE: TKR), those stocks are both in the red in the past month. Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) is now about 3.7 percent over the same time. Those four stocks combine for 17.5 percent of the ETF's weight. The hits just keep on coming to SLX. Even before today, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) was down 12 percent since early March. That stock is now flirting with levels not seen since March 2009. SLX also has the misfortune of being home to Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF), the shares of which have plunged more than 52 percent in the past 90 days. Cliffs and U.S. Steel combine for about 6.8 percent of SLX's weight. Thus far in this piece, approximately half of SLX's weight has been accounted for and none of the news is good. Since it an equity-based ETF is moved by its underlying holdings, it is not surprising to see that SLX's technical situation is rapidly worsening. It appears the ETF is heading for its lowest closing price since late May 2012. Additionally, SLX's ability to defend $40 is vital to any hopes of a rebound because the ETF has not closed below that level in nearly four years. For more on ETFs, click here."

In the report, Goldman Sachs noted, “We upgrade STLD to Buy from Neutral, as we expect the company to benefit from a continued recovery in the non-residential construction market, benefit from recent growth capex to higher value added products like premium rails and SBQ, as well as the impact from successful implementation of its Mesabi Nugget project which so far has been a big draw on its income.

We raise our 6-month P/E-, EV/EBITDA-, and M&A-based price target to $22 from $17, implying 24% upside potential, as we update our methodology to include a 50% weighting on normalized (mid-cycle) estimates and a 50% weighing on 2014 estimates.” Steel Dynamics closed on Friday at $17.78."

2013-11-18,Retro Wall Street Aims to Educate,"A couple of retro Wall Streeters aim to take clients and investor to a bygone era of trading. Speaking on Benzinga's premarket Internet broadcast, Tim Collins and Bob Byrne shared what Retro Wall Street is about and some insight into their view of the market. We bring back the old style of trading - a time when individuals would share and actually work together, Collins said. Back when there was personality, It wasn't just a screen or just an algorithm. Collins said that they don't trade in the hot areas or even out west. He uses Candlesticks for analysis, where seller rejection is created, leading to more buyers stepping in. He likes Candlesticks more for intraday trading, which Retro Wall Street is based on, than on a daily basis. GDP and monthly reports don't have any bearing on short-term trading, aside from the initial, Byrne said. I do follow fundamentals. But I'm less concerned about current and more so how it relates to the last 5-10 years. If I need a CFA Level 3 to understand something, it's not for me. Their website says that they are not too proud to say they've failed at some point in their trading or business career due to a lack of education or sound mentoring. Learning from the experience and mistakes of others is invaluable. That doesn't mean they lack that education. Related: Cannabis Stock Analyst Talks About High Revenue Potential Collins is a graduate of McDaniel College, with three degrees in business administration, economics and sociology. Byrne holds a business degree from St. Edward's University. They have worked in various positions with the finance world for over 14 years. If market is trending, less is more, Byrne said. You try and get one trade and hold it. Choppy is great for a day trader. Collins said they have been focusing on steel the last few months, with Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) at the top of their radar, followed closely by U.S. Steel (NYSE: X). He likes coal, but is not very comfortable with gold at its current levels. I believe that (coal) to be a second-half story. It's a little bit later in second half than we hoped, but think it's good. Collins also said not a day goes by where they don't look at Twitter or Facebook as an intraday trade. We laugh for more than we trade, but I wouldn't have it any other way, Collins said.

2014-07-22,UPDATE: UBS Securities Reiterates On Steel Dynamics On Columbus Potential,"In a report published Tuesday, UBS Securities analyst Matt Murphy reiterated a Buy rating on Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), and raised the price target from $21.00 to $23.00. In the report, UBS Securities noted, “STLD expects Columbus to generate some $270M in EBITDA in 2015E or ~$90/t, as implied by the 6x EV/EBITDA (2015E) multiple STLD models in its $1,625M acquisition cost. We feel this is reasonable, and loftier targets are likely achievable over time; the addition of another $20M in synergies in 2016E could bring the total to $95/t. With time, STLD noted >$100/t levels could be sustained. If we assume STLD can sustain $110/t at Columbus (not too far a stretch from the $103/ton reported in Q1/14), this translates to $374M in EBITDA at full run-rates, $100M above 2015E.” Steel Dynamics closed on Monday at $20.75."

2014-08-04,KeyBanc: M&A And Potential Trade Cases Strengthen Certain Steel Companies,"According to analysts at KeyBanc, there exists a solid stream of macro-economic and other data sects which indicates there exists a demand recovery in the steel market. This bodes well for the risk-reward characteristics in shares of United States Steel (NYSE: X) and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) The analysts, Philip Gibbs and Tyler Kenyon, point out that stable auto sales data, PMI, ABI and rig count all confirm the steel industry is on track to achieve a three percent to five percent consumption growth rate by the end of 2014. M&A Potential And Trade Cases According to the analysts, investors could expect further consolidation in M&A activity over near-term. In addition, the notion of “leveling the playing field” through trade restrictions is becoming more likely. “We expect a series of trade cases to be filed over the next six to twelve months, targeted at carbon sheet and plate products arenas,” the analysts wrote. “While trade case fillings may not ultimately stifle the volumes of steel coming into the United States, we believe, at a minimum, this will help solidify the pricing floor across sheet and plate products.” The analysts note that M&A activity and trade cases may “defray” some investor concerns related to industry pricing power and the higher domestic steel prices compared to foreign competitors. The analysts are raising their 2014 and 2015 sheet pricing assumptions based on a tighter U.S. supply-demand balance. The analysts are projecting a cost of $669 per ton for U.S. Hot Rolled Coil in 2014 which will slightly decline to $645 per ton in 2015, which is in-line with the current NYMEX futures curve. United States Steel: 45 Percent Upside Gibbs and Kenyon established a $48 price target on shares of United States Steel, representing over 45 percent upside from current share prices. At the same time, the analysts upgraded shares from Hold to Buy. The analysts previously held bearish views based on an OCTG trade case ruling in mid-February. Additionally, an “escalating malaise” in the commodities environment existed along with a general concern that an iron ore pricing correction has the potential to drive U.S. sheet pricing lower. These negative sentiments have abated in recent months given a more positive OCTG trade case final determination and a perception that the iron ore correct has run its course. Looking forward, the analysts express a bullish sentiment that exceeds the Street's current expectation. The reasons include the potential for further productivity savings announcements, growth initiatives and potential higher interest rates that could create additional positive catalysts. The analysts are expecting United States Steel to report a third quarter earnings per share estimate of $1.19, noticeably higher than the Street's estimate of $0.73. In fiscal 2015 the analysts are projecting a full year earnings per share of $4.00, also noticeably higher than the Street's estimate of $2.29. Steel Dynamics: 30 Percent Upside Gibbs and Kenyon established a $28 price target on shares of Steel Dynamics, representing over 30 percent upside from current share prices. At the same time, the analysts upgraded shares from Hold to Buy. The analysts believe that Steel Dynamics offer investors an under-appreciated story given the likelihood of “upside surprises” from its acquisition of Severstal's Columbus facility. In addition, investors are perhaps also under-appreciating Steel Dynamic's improving sheet metal spreads, operational progress at Mesabi Nugget and a “sizable” pro forma free cash flow in 2015 of over $600. Other Notable Ratings Gibbs and Kenyon maintained a Hold rating on AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) with no assigned price target. Gibbs and Kenyon maintained a Buy rating on Nucor (NYSE: NUE) with an unchanged $58 price target."

2014-09-03,"Morgan Stanley Names U.S. Steel, Steel Dynamics As Top Picks","Morgan Stanley issued a very strong view on United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE: STLD) Wednesday morning. Viewing the steel industry as Attractive, the bank increased its price targets by nearly 40 percent and notes U.S. Steel and Steel Dynamics as its top picks. U.S. Steel is rated Overweight and its price target was hiked from $35 to $60. Steel Dynamics is rated Overweight with a price target increase from $21 to $28. The main drivers for the firm's view are: Further consolidation (which will correct poor pricing patterns and import order patterns) A return to capacity utilization to the 80 percent plus range New import duties and potential for further cases Improving underlying demand A structural increase in service center inventories Analyst Evan Kurtz sums his views on the two steel producers: In addition to high fixed cost leverage, US Steel’s new management team has been successfully cutting costs. The company may also find a way to walk away from their loss-making operation in Canada in our bull case. Steel Dynamics, a well run, low-cost producer, is a safer way to play a recovery. We see upside from under-appreciated profits at Columbus and the shutdown or fix of Mesabi. The steel industry is streamlining itself as demand improves, capacity closures help chop of wasteful plants and restrained supply growth are finally working together to push capacity utilization to the 80 percent mark. The firm continued: We believe that once utilization reaches into the 80%+ range (which has just occurred on a weekly basis), mills will see enhanced pricing power and profitability. Several factors contribute to this dynamic. First, higher utilization means less unused capacity chasing business. Second, higher output means greater fixed cost absorption, particularly for blast furnace operators. Shares of U.S. Steel opened up 3.1 percent higher, while Steel Dynamics was up 2.5 percent."

2014-12-03,Morgan Stanley Sees Upside For Steel Dynamics As Margins Expand,"Morgan Stanley reiterated its Overweight rating and $28 price target on Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) in a research note issued Wednesday. Analyst Evan L. Kurtz noted that “Investors are concerned about steel prices given cost deflation and imports. However, margins matter more and we forecast EAF metal margin expansion given favorable structural trends. STLD stands to directly benefit, and with a good tactical setup.” “While foreign producers can export deflation to the US via steel, we believe structural industry improvements (consolidation, logistics constraints, trade barriers, and favorable demand trends) will mitigate downward pressure on domestic prices,” according to Kurtz. “We now expect $615/t HRC in 2015 with a metal margin of $295/t vs. $660/t HRC and a $265/t margin in 2014. As a result, our 2015 Steel Dynamics EPS estimate rises to $2.50, well above consensus of $2.20, implying a reasonable 11x P/E on our $28 price target.” Kurtz felt that “despite the recent expansion in metal margins as the decline in scrap prices outpaced the fall in steel prices, Steel Dynamics shares have remained range-bound. We see upside as consensus begins to incorporate lower scrap costs. The current share price offers an attractive entry point ahead of the seasonally strongest period of the year (January to April).” Kurtz concluded that “Steel Dynamics will continue to benefit from several positive structural industry changes, including: 1) Consolidation among flat-rolled producers; 2) Logistics delays affecting rail, truck, and barge availability and pricing, which help protect the Midwest market from imports; 3) Supportive trade policy, including the potential for additional trade cases; and 4) Favorable underlying demand trends (onshoring, autos, non-res).” Steel Dynamics closed Tuesday at $21.90, down 0.5 percent."

2015-01-15,"Barclays Is Bullish On Steel Producers, Neutral On Copper Miners And Cautious On Coal Companies","Matthew Korn of Barclays on Thursday commented that concerns on global growth and persistently weak commodity prices remain an overhang among the metals and mining group. Korn is bullish on steel producers given the producers exposure to an improving American steel demand that should offset the downward trend in steel pricing. The analyst favors Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) as they both stand to gain from steel consumption growth from construction, manufacturing and automotive industries. In addition, both companies have major projects that are expected to reach critical mass in 2015 that could drive greater raw material self-sufficiency, lower costs and improved cash flows. Korn is Neutral on copper miners as the bullish impact of lower-than-expected metal supply will outweigh a slowdown in Chinese consumption growth, pushing copper prices higher. The analyst adds that Southern Copper Corp (NYSE: SCCO) offers a more favorable risk profile compared to Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX), whose stock remains pressured by uncertainty around its Indonesian operations. Finally, Korn is cautious on coal companies as low natural gas prices along with growing utility regulations, and a slowing Chinese demand for imported coal will hurt demand. The analyst states that “there is really not much these companies can do” except hope for a price upturn. Nevertheless, Cloud Peak Energy Inc (NYSE: CLD) offers a “relatively healthy” balance sheet, a steady thermal-only PRB market and reasonable valuation on realistic pricing."

2015-01-16,Barclays Bullish On Steel (And Mini-Mill Companies),"In a report published Thursday, Barclays weighed in on U.S. metals and mining, and expressed its bullishness on the steel, even in spite of concerns on global growth and persistently weak commodity prices. Analysts Matthew J. Korn and Kalpesh Patel said they believe that the effects of the downward trend in steel pricing will be offset by the steel mini-mill companies' exposure to increasing American steel demand. The research firm believes that its Overweight-rated steel stocks, Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), stand to gain from steel consumption growth from the U.S. construction, manufacturing, and automotive industries, (…) while offering little direct exposure to the suddenly troubled energy sector. Barclays initiated coverage on both Steel Dynamics and Nucor as Overweight cases, with respective price targets of $30 and $62. This implies an upside potential of approximately 74 percent for the former, and 40 percent for the latter. In addition, both companies expect to see major projects to reach critical mass in 2015. This should drive greater raw material self-sufficiency, lower costs, and improved cash flows."

Forecast Analysts lowered their projected Hot Rolled Coil (HRC) forecast from $600 per short ton to $575. In addition, After incorporating the latest steel prices and the updated Q4 earnings numbers Deutsche Bank reduced its 2015 EBITDA predictions by about 11 percent. Downside risk U.S. HRC prices have dropped by 21 percent in the past six months, falling to as low as $543 per short ton. Analysts believe that the industry is near an inflection point, and they list four reasons for their hopefulness: 1. Supply-side response 2. Contraction of import arbitrage 3. Seasonal increase in demand 4. Increased protectionism Deutsche Bank stress tested its model for a full-year HRC price of $550 per short ton ($25 below its forecast) and found that the average downside in expected EBITDA for the companies it covers is about 19 percent. Steel demand expected to remain strong Steel demand will likely remain high in 2015 from both the automotive industry and the construction industry. While falling oil prices have collapsed steel demand in the energy sector (about 10 percent of the total steel demand), low oil prices have stimulated steel demand in other segments of the economy. Stock picks Even with the 19 percent downside earnings risk related to low steel prices, Deutsche Bank analysts believe the beaten-down stocks in the space offer a compelling risk/reward balance at current prices. Deutsche Bank lowered price targets but reiterated their Buy ratings on AK Steel Holding Corp (NYSE: AKS), Steel Dynamics Inc (NASDAQ: STLD) and United States Steel Corp (NYSE: X). Deutsce Bank has a Hold rating on Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE)."
2015-02-23,Morgan Stanley: Steel Dynamics Still a Best Idea,"Morgan Stanley analysts reiterated that Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) is a “best idea,” despite the recent steel price decline. The analysts noted that the price adjustment is a “bump in the road,” as opposed to a “sustained cause for concern.” Under that backdrop, the analysts defined current price as an “attractive entry point” heading into Q1 guidance, which they said might be weak. However, it may be a buy the news event as the market focuses on Q2 and beyond. Because Steel Dynamics uses primarily scrap metals, the analysts noted that margins matter more than absolute steel prices. As Steel Dynamics depletes existing scrap supply, it will be able to replenish at much lower prices, helping to benefit margins. Morgan Stanley reiterated its $28 price target for Steel Dynamics, a 44 percent upside from Friday’s closing price."

2015-03-03,"Nomura Says U.S. Is The Biggest Loser In Steel Trade Wars, Downgrades 2 Names","In a report published Tuesday, Nomura analyst Curt Woodworth argued that the United States is the biggest loser in the steel trade wars. According to Woodworth, there are two major structural changes underway that should significantly alter the global steep landscape in the coming years: The first being the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, while the second change being a curve deflation drive by lower raw material prices and freight rates. Woodworth expanded that the cost curve deflation in Russia and China, coupled with weak domestic demand trends in both nations should result in continued export pressure into the global market. We believe these forces are highly disruptive to the US market, especially for integrated producers, but also EAF players to some degree, Woodworth wrote. We note that both flat-rolled and long product import pressure has been a significant headwind for the industry over the past year and Nomura expectations for further USD appreciation into 2016 suggests import pressure will remain high. Woodworth added that U.S. integrated produces are most at risk from a margin standpoint, mostly due to lower relative cost reductions and greater volume share loss potential that would pressure unit costs. Rating Changes Shares of AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) were downgraded to Neutral from Buy with a price target lowered to $4 from a previous $10.

In a report issued by the firm, Steel Dynamics was upgraded to Buy, from Neutral, and the price target was raised by $1 to $21. The analysts explain that, while they had been concerned that STLD's results and free cash generation would be negatively impacted by the drop in steel prices as well as the increased energy exposure from the acquired Columbus assets, the recent dividend hike and the call of $350 million of debt makes them more confident in the company's free cash flow generation and further deleveraging opportunities. The analysts add, As the US steel market finds a bottom from both a pricing and utilization rate perspective, STLD is one of the higher quality companies to invest in a potential turnaround. If we are wrong and the US steel market does not improve, the company has consistently proven that they can generate positive free cash at any point in the steel cycle, including extreme troughs such as 2010. After updating their estimates for quarter-to-date steel and scrap prices, Citi expects EPS of $0.26 for the first quarter, down from a previous $0.29, on lower expectations for sheet price realizations. For the full year of 2015, they project EPS of $1.58, while the 2016 forecast remains unchanged at $1.90 per share."

2015-03-19,Steel Sector Sells Off: Nucor Corp. Complains About Imports,"Steel makers' shares fell broadly Thursday after Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE) said higher imports of cheaply priced Chinese imported steel will result in lower-than-expected first-quarter profits. Pittsburgh-based Nucor is the world's 14th-largest steel maker, just behind United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X). The exceptionally high level of imports flooding the domestic market will result in lower prices and narrower margins, Nucor said. U.S. Steel last week cited a high level of imports and unfairly traded products in a plan to temporarily idle its Minnesota ore operations effective May 13. The steel-sector sell-off gave back gains from a rally Wednesday, perhaps touched off from an outlook offered by the much smaller Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD). Steel Dynamics said imports will decline in the second half of 2015 as domestic steel prices fall to a competitive level. The company predicted improving profits as a result. But in what may be a prelude to an anti-dumping complaint to the International Trade Commission, U.S. steelmakers plan to meet with the Congressional Steel Caucus later this month, according to The Wall Street Journal. http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-chinese-steel-exports-are-stirring-protests-1426466068 As demand in China slows, its steel mills haven't cut production but have instead flooded the U.S. market.

2015-03-19,Analyst Sees Wider Margins For Steel Dynamics,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) will see widening margins in the second half of 2015 resulting from lower costs for scrap and receding competition from imports, an analyst said Thursday. Morgan Stanley's Evan L. Kurtz reiterated an Overweight rating and $28 target on the company and said conditions in the steel business have hit bottom. The company, which provided an earnings outlook for its first quarter Wednesday, gave back some of its recent gains and changed hands Thursday at $19.40, off 4.5 percent. Kurtz said Wednesday's outlook removes a key overhang on the company's shares. We see upside as steel prices inflect, Kurtz said. The company's margins will improve beginning in the second half of 2015 as steel prices stabilize and the cost of scrap declines. Kurtz said scrap prices will still fall further, in order to hit a sustainable level relative to the relatively low cost of iron ore. The price of U.S.-made steel, meanwhile has overshot its sustainable spread relative to Chinese imports, Kurtz said. With reasonably strong demand from the auto industry and construction, Steel Holdings expects oversupply in the market can be worked off by April or May, leading to higher capacity utilization. The company forecast first-quarter adjusted earnings of $0.12 to $0.16 a share, versus Wall Street's expectation of $0.21 a share. But many investors were expecting break-even earnings for the quarter, Kurtz said, adding that he believes the guidance is actually above buy-side expectations."

2015-03-20,Analyst Prefers Steel Dynamics Inc. As Prices Stabilize,"AK Steel Holding Corp. (NYSE: AKS) stands to loose out as a high-cost operator when steel prices begin stabilizing, an analyst said Friday. AK issued a profit warning Thursday, joining Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE) which made similar announcements this week. Each blamed falling steel prices caused by an influx of cheap imports from China, but Wells Fargo's Sam Dubinsky said prices have hit bottom. Dubinsky rates all three steel makers at Market Perform, but said Nucor and Steel Dynamics will see wider profit margins starting in the second half of 2015. Citing its valuation, Dubinsky called Steel Dynamics a better value for investors who want to time the firming up of fundamentals in the steel industry, relative to Nucor. Although prices may be on the cusp of stabilization, Dubinsky doesn't see them rising substantially. That's problematic for high-cost producers, Dubinsky said. AK Steel doesn't have many levers to generate profits outside of a price recovery. Lower costs for iron ore, scrap, and coal should help modestly, but not enough in our view for AK's turnaround, Dubinsky said. Steel imports should subside in coming months as prices for domestically made product have fallen to competitive levels, Dubinsky said. A number of U.S. steel makers have recently spoken of unfair trade practices by China, and a complaint to the International Trade Commission may be in the offing."

2015-06-25,Macquarie Just Hiked Long-Term Steel Dynamics Estimates,"In a Thursday morning equities research report, Macquarie analysts Aldo Mazzaferro and Stacey Kerelska reiterated an Outperform rating on Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), while raising their target price from $25 to $26. They believe the company can continue to outpace its peers on the back of “a more aggressive growth profile, cost reduction opportunity, and leverage provided by its balance sheet.” In addition, the firm restated its 2015 EPS estimate of $1.05, while boosting its 2016 and 2017 estimates to $1.75 and $2.00, respectively, from $1.55 and $1.80, following the management’s recent guidance. The estimates now exclude negative effects from discontinued Mesabi Nugget. Implications The report highlights a few implications of the revised model: Volumes rose, quarter-over-quarter, in the second quarter, which will be reported in less than a month. The analysts explained that benefits from the Columbus mill acquisition “continue to accrue to the company in the form of volume upside and cost synergies… [and] STLD has managed to reduce the new mill’s exposure to the oil & gas market, while moving some volume in value-added products.” Macquarie thinks Steel Dynamics “is best positioned due to its growth profile, and also stands to benefit most from the recent trade litigation on galvanized sheet should it be successful.

2015-06-25,"Macquarie Just Hiked Long-Term Steel Dynamics Estimates, Here's Why","In its Thursday morning equities research report, Macquarie analystsAldo Mazzaferro and Stacey Kerelska reiterated an Outperform rating on shares of Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), while raising their target price from $25.00 to $26.00. They believe the company can continue to outpace its peers on the back of “a more aggressive growth profile, cost reduction opportunity, and leverage provided by its balance sheet.” In addition, the firm restated its 2015 EPS estimate of $1.05 while boosting its 2016 and 2017 estimates to $1.75 and $2.00, respectively, from $1.55 and $1.80, correspondingly, following the management’s recent –solid- guidance. The estimates now exclude negative effects from discontinued Mesabi Nugget. Implications The report highlights a few implications of the revised model: Volumes rose, quarter-over-quarter, in the second quarter, which will be reported in less than a month. The experts explain that benefits from the Columbus mill acquisition “continue to accrue to the company in the form of volume upside and cost synergies… [and] STLD has managed to reduce the new mill’s exposure to the oil & gas market, while moving some volume in value-added products.” Macquarie thinks Steel Dynamics “is best positioned due to its growth profile, and also stands to benefit most from the recent trade litigation on galvanized sheet should it be successful” – the company is a major galvanized sheet player in the South. Steel Dynamics would also be advantageously positioned in cold rolled or hot rolled products if litigation were to succeed in this area too."

2015-09-16,Jefferies Shows Concern Related To Steel Sector In Q3 And Beyond,"Luke Folta of Jefferies stated in a note that headwinds facing the steel sector is stronger now than at any other time since the 2009 global downturn. Reduction in metal pricing and a lower than previously expected overall demand resulted in a 12 percent reduction to earnings forecasts and corresponding price target objectives. Companies with the highest/most defensible margins can still offer investors good value. In a report published Wednesday, Jefferies analyst Luke Folta revised his steel estimates lower, reflecting weaker U.S. demand trends and a darkened outlook for global steel prices due to a slowing Chinese demand and strong U.S. dollar. Folta's bearish stance stems from his third quarter steel survey which suggested steel demand continues to trend lower versus expectations and a recovery in steel prices is unlikely to occur in 2015. The analyst added that diminished demand is also attributed to a severe pullback in oil and gas along with incremental weakness in key industries including mining and agriculture. Folta said 52 percent of industry contacts he surveyed reported a weaker steel demand quarter over quarter while 39 percent anticipate a seasonally weaker fourth quarter. Meanwhile, prices for HRC (hot-rolled coil) saw renewed weakness to $450/t as of mid-September, although recent deals were reportedly as low as $420/t with 29 percent of contacts are expecting further incremental weakness. As such, the analyst revised his 2015 HRC price target lower by $27/t to $464 and slashed his 2016 estimates by $47/t to $476. Related Link: This Part Of Alcoa's Business Is Flying Under The Radar Value Still To Be Found In Stocks Folta stated that it has been his core thesis for some time to favor steel companies that lead the industry in terms of : 1) margins and free cash flow generation, 2) favorable low/variable cost structure, 3) high value product offering and lack of outsized cash requirements (i.e pension, capex, etc), 4) ability to enable growth through investments. In addition, companies with above average exposure to the U.S. non-residential construction market is also a favorable attribute. The analyst added that Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE: RS), Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) are companies that satisfy his criteria and offer good value.

2015-11-04,Steel Dynamics Comments On Department Of Commerce Preliminary Determination Regarding Corrosion-Resistant Flat Roll Steel Imports,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ/GS: STLD) commented that the company is very pleased with yesterday's announcement by the Department of Commerce (DOC) concerning preliminary countervailing duties against imports of corrosion-resistant steel from China and also accepting of the findings related to India and Italy. The company had anticipated minimal results for Taiwan and Korea. The company produces corrosion-resistant steel including hot-dipped galvanized, Galvalume(R), and painted steel at two facilities located in Indiana, one facility located in Mississippi and three facilities located in Pennsylvania. Steel Dynamics is the largest non-automotive producer of galvanized flat roll steel in the United States. The product is used in many construction applications, automotive parts and numerous consumer products. The DOC found subsidy rates ranging from 26% to 236% against imports from China, the biggest source of corrosion-resistant steel imports into the United States in 2014. The Chinese companies with 236% duties will also have these duties applied retroactively by 90 days because of a preliminary affirmative critical circumstances finding by the DOC as the result of recent import surges from China. Imports from India, the third largest source of U.S. corrosion-resistant steel imports in 2014, were subjected to subsidy findings of 2.85% to 7.7%. One of the largest Italian producers was given a subsidy rate of 38.4% and was also subject to retroactive duty assessment under critical circumstances. Not unexpected, Korea, the fourth largest source of corrosion-resistant steel imports in 2014, was given negligible subsidy findings and Taiwan, the second largest, received no subsidy findings. The DOC will finalize its subsidy findings by the end of January 2016, unless the petitioners request an alignment of the subsidy final determinations with final antidumping duty determinations. That decision has not yet been made. The DOC will issue preliminary antidumping determinations against these same five countries on December 22, 2015. On Friday, October 30, the Department made preliminary critical circumstances findings based upon import surges from China, Korea and Taiwan. Total 2014 corrosion-resistant flat roll steel imports from these five countries were $2.2 billion, representing more than 50% of total 2014 corrosion-resistant steel imports. For these duties to eventually go into effect, the International Trade Commission will need to make affirmative determinations of injury or threat of injury in 2016."
2015-11-09,Morgan Stanley Moving To The Sidelines On U.S. Steel,"Shares of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) have declined 55.14 percent in the past six months, touching a low of $9.91 on October 1. Morgan Stanley’s Evan L. Kurtz has downgraded the rating on the company to Equal-weight, while lowering the price target from $30 to $19. Following the weaker Q3 results reported by the company, Kurtz prefers to move to the sidelines, given that the risk/reward on the stock now appears more skewed to the downside. Analyst Evan Kurtz mentioned that U.S. Steel reported weaker-than-anticipated Q3 results, driven by a $20 per ton miss on costs. The company also lowered its 2015 EBITDA guidance below the prior estimate to $225 million. “We have now gone from a positive base case to bear case skew, to a negative skew. In addition, despite our view that US steel prices will begin to recover in 1Q16, and average $510/t for the year, our new 2016 EBITDA estimate of $410m falls below consensus of $737m,” Kurtz stated. Although prices are expected to recover in 2016, if the timing or magnitude of this recovery misses expectations, there could be downside to the stock. In fact, Kurtz believes that Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) is a better stock to own in the current market environment. According to the Morgan Stanley report, “As a low-cost scrap based steel producer, STLD has been less affected by the recent scrap driven price declines.”"

2015-11-24,"Steel Price To Recover In 2016, Major Bank Predicts","Timna Tanners of Bank of America is expecting 2016 benchmark US hot rolled coil (HRC) to average $455/short ton, marking an increase from current spot prices of around $375 to $390 per ton. Tanners suggested that minimills will prove to be the more attractive investment option. The analyst added that United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) could only see a near-term boost from trade case and mill price hike headlines. US hot rolled coil (HRC) are currently selling for $375 to $390 per ton on the spot market. According to Timna Tanners of Bank of America, HRC prices are expected to increase to an average of $455/short ton in 2016, marking a more modest rebound than previously thought. Tanners previously projected HRC prices would rise to $475/t in 2016. Her revised focus was attributed to a lower base than previously expected given the recent market implosion. The analyst added that her China steel team is now forecasting a decline of 1.2 percent in global demand growth through 2016, but net exports will remain high at 91 million mt versus 96 million mt expected in 2015. Minimills To Take Share, Nucor A ‘Wildcard' According to Tanners, minimills will increasingly be the more attractive investment option heading into 2016 as the integrateds (such as US Steel and AK Steel) will only see a near-term boost from trad case and mill price hike headlines. However, the price hikes may prove to be insufficient to enable the integrateds to return to profitability. Tanners added that both US Steel and AK Steel face lower annual contract pricing on 25-33 percent of shipments next year. In addition to that, US Steel will likely face liquidity issues in 2017 given a $450 million maturity mid 2017 and another $500 million maturity in early 2018. Tanners also noted that Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) is the wild card heading into 2016 as it is uncertain if it will use the projected $2.2 billion in free cash flow it will generate in 2015 for any accretive activity. Ratings And Price Targets Shares of AK Steel remain Underperform rated with an unchanged $1 price target. Shares of Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) remain Neutral rated with an unchanged $17 price target. Shares of Nucor remain Buy rated with an unchanged $52 price target. Shares of Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) remain Buy rated with an unchanged $23 price target. Shares of US Steel remain Underperform rated with a price target lowered to $3 from a previous $7."
2015-12-07,Highlights From Barclays' 2016 Top Picks' List,"As 2015 comes to an end, a team of analysts at Barclays compiled their list of top picks for 2016. The analysts noted that ongoing headwinds, such as China concerns, do not imply a retreat from equities in the near term. The analysts added that equity valuations are in-line with their long-term average, and the key to continued appreciation rests with earnings. The analysts pointed out that from a historical perspective, early stages of U.S. Federal Reserve tightening have not derailed global equities. In fact, the market's eventual resilience following the Fed's decision to end its QE program in October 2014 provides recent evidence of the market's hitherto relatively relaxed approach to the withdrawal of extremely loose monetary conditions. With that said, the analysts presented their top picks, all of which are Outperform rated. Here is a summary of some of the more notable picks. Apple Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) has three major characteristics that could contribute to a 10 percent or better earnings growth: 1) a loyal consumer base, 2) the recently announced iPhone financing program, and 3) an underappreciated growth coming from the iPad Pro. Shares are Overweight rated with a $155 price target. Facebook As advertising dollars continue shifting online, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) will prove to be a major beneficiary of this seismic shift. In fact, the company has already shown an impressive transition from desktop to mobile as 78 percent of its ad revenue is derived from mobile devices. Shares are Overweight rated with a $140 price target. MobileEye Simply put, Mobileye NV (NYSE: MBLY) is in the sweet spot of the fast-growing advanced driver assistance systems and semi-autonomous driving markets. Shares are Overweight rated with a $76 price target. Nasdaq Nasdaq Inc (NASDAQ: NDAQ) is the most compelling investment case among its peers due to: 1) the stock trading at a meaningful discount to its peers and the overall market, 2) a strong free cash flow that can continue supporting outsized capital return initiatives, and 3) a consistently-growing revenue profile. Shares are Overweight rated with a $64 price target. PepsiCo PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) offers the best of both worlds within the U.S. beverage space: a robust fundamental outlook and the potential for longer-term strategic action within both its beverage and snacks business. Shares are Overweight rated with a $111 price target. Salesforce salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM) has demonstrated an impressive ability to sustain growth through a healthy combination of development and strategic acquisitions while simultaneously improving profitability. The investment case is further solidified by the fact that the company is creating a difficult environment for challengers. Shares are Overweight rated with a $90 price target. Sprouts Farmers Market As the ongoing health and wellness continues to expand, Sprouts Farmers Market Inc (NASDAQ: SFM) is well positioned given its unique store format, targeted product assortment, and price advantage in produce that are at least 20 percent below its competitors. Shares are Overweight rated with a $30 price target. Steel Dynamics Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) inclusion to the top ideas list may be surprising given the stock lost more than 25 percent over the past year amid plunging steel prices. Nevertheless, the analysts expect the company to outperform its peers by maintaining its industry-high operating rates, refining its product portfolio and establishing a solid free cash flow generation. Shares are Overweight rated with a $24 price target. United Continental United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE: UAL) is best positioned among its peers given its outsized international exposure that is Atlantic and Pacific based rather than the more economically challenged Latin American markets. In addition, the return of the company's CEO Oscar Munoz will reinvigorate the company's efforts to close the margin cap versus its legacy peers in 2016. Shares are Overweight rated with a $78 price target. Valera Energy Valera Energy Corporation (NYSE: VLO) is a top pick among refiners given its commitment to pursuing growth opportunities while simultaneously returning cash to shareholders. In fact, the analysts expect the company to buy back $500 to $600 million of its stock every quarter through the end of the decade while raising its annual dividend payout by at least 10 percent per year. Shares are Overweight rated with a $93 price target."

2016-01-22,Morgan Stanley Sees Positive Momentum In Steel Heading Into Q4; Negative On Coal Names,"Morgan Stanley’s Evan L Kurt mentioned that positive steel market commentary could drive certain heavily shorted names; conversely negative coal commentary may limit upside to some stocks. While 4Q should reflect positive momentum in US steel prices, the coal market conditions have deteriorated, Kurt stated. Positive Momentum In US Steel Prices The easing of imports and inventory headwinds combined with some mill outages have resulted in US steel prices rising from below $360/t to about $400/t in recent weeks. This positive momentum could be dampened to some extent by soft underlying demand as well as weak global pricing, analyst Evan Kurt said. He expects prices to continue to rise and average $445/t in 2016, which may result in downward revisions to Street estimates for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) [Rating: Equal-Weight, PT: $19], AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) [Rating: Equal-Weight, PT: $5] and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) [Rating: Equal-Weight, PT: reduced from $62 to $59]. Kurt commented that Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) is “the safest way to play a modest steel market recovery,” while adding, “That said, heavily shorted names such as X and AKS could squeeze into results, but we would sell the news.” The rating for Steel Dynamics is maintained at Overweight, while the price target has been reduced from $28 to $27. The analyst also mentioned that Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF) was a “high cost producer in an oversupplied iron ore market.” He has an Underweight rating for the company and a price target of $2. Negative On Coal Names “No need to own coal names into the quarter,” Kurt wrote. He explained that coal market conditions had deteriorated in recent months, with a warmer-than-normal winter leading to large build-ups of coal inventories. “We think producer commentary will take on a negative tone, which will keep longs on the sidelines and bolster conviction in shorts,” the Morgan Stanley report stated. Kurt downgraded the ratings for CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX) and Foresight Energy LP (NYSE: FELP) from Overweight to Equal-Weight, while maintaining price targets of $29 and $12, respectively. He said that the changed ratings reflected an adjustment “for our reduced coal coverage footprint.”"

2016-02-16,Buy Steel Dynamics? Morgan Stanley Now More Convicted In 'Top Pick',"On Tuesday, Morgan Stanley issued a company note on Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) after the firm's Quarterly Steel Executives Dinner. Currently, analysts at Morgan Stanley rate Steel Dynamics as Overweight with a $27 price target. Evan Kurtz and Hunter Alley, analysts at Morgan Stanley, wrote, “The key takeaways from our dinner on 2/9 feed into our positive call on STLD [...] Steel Dynamics has the largest percentage of flat-rolled steel in their mix of the mini-mills. “They predominantly produce steel in the Midwest where scrap prices are lower and steel prices are higher [...] We believe that STLD is the best positioned of all the steel equities.” Related Link: U.S. Steel, Tesla And Four Other Hot Stocks Among Short-Selling Circles Justification Morgan Stanley gave two takeaways on why they see strength in Steel Dynamics: 1. Acquisitions Analysts noted that Steel Dynamics has recently acquired Columbus Electric Air Furnace, which should yield synergies and be accretive to earnings and cash flow. Furthermore, this acquisition may allow Steel Dynamics to accelerate top-line growth. 2. Margin Expansion Morgan Stanley believes that between rising steel prices and little change in scrap pricing, Steel Dynamics has the potential to drive increases in their margins. Furthermore, because Steel Dynamics operates largely out of the Midwest they are less exposed to competition from imports compared to their southern competitors and they currently have strong hedges against currency swings. Steel Dynamics was recently seen trading up around 1 percent on the day at $18.51. Image Credit: Public Domain"
2016-02-23,Darker Days For Steel? Cowen Downgrades U.S. Steel And ArcelorMittal,"Cowen’s Anthony B. Rizzuto downgraded the ratings for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) and ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE: MT) to Market Perform, saying that these integrated producers are likely to be more challenged given their inferior cost structure compared to EAF producers like Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) [Rated: Outperform, PT: $25] The price targets for US Steel and Arcelor Mittal are at $8 and $4, respectively. Analyst Anthony Rizzuto mentioned that following the recent increase in US flat-rolled carbon steel prices, there is little chance of further upside from the current levels. “Following the bottoming of U.S. HRC prices at $365/st in late 2015, we were hopeful that steady demand, falling imports, production curtailments, and positive trade case determinations could enable prices to rally to $450-500/st, enabling integrated producers to return to profitability on spot tonnage sales,” Rizzuto wrote. The analyst believes that while the prices have stabilized in the low $400/st range, the downturn is likely to continue. There is unlikely to be a significant rebound in energy steel demand in 2016, and the weakness in oil and gas products continues to have a negative impact on the US industrial economy. “While we do not see any imminent liquidity issues for U.S. Steel, we have been increasingly concerned about balance sheet strength and cash burn,” the Cowen report stated. Market checks reveal that OEMs are concerned about the long-term viability of their suppliers and are, thus, pursuing much shorter qualification period trials with EAF steelmakers. Rizzuto commented that the growing capabilities of companies like Steel Dynamics in automotive and appliance applications will result in increased market share for them. The current challenging environment, companies with a high degree of variable cost, the ability to take market share, generate free cash flows, drive organic and acquisitive growth and having a desirable end-market mix with significant exposure to non-residential construction are poised to grow, Rizzuto added."
2016-03-11,U.S. Metals: Balancing A Constructive Domestic Macro Environment Against China Risks,"In their US Metals & Mining Industry report, Credit Suisse’s Curt Woodworth mentioned that the US macro outlook remained “supportive,” with strong medium-term growth potential in both automotive and non-residential construction. Apart from China macro risks, the market has grown increasingly concerned about US demand trends, after the significant volume weakness witnessed in the back half of 2015 and softer micro data-points across energy, industrial and commercial construction markets. Analyst Curt Woodworth expects a strong rebound in US demand, backed by required restocking as well as strength in automotive and a marginal improvement in commercial construction. US Steel: Strong Outlook For Volume And Pricing Woodworth initiated coverage of the US Steel Sector with a bullish stance. He mentioned that the US market seemed close to a cyclical low point in terms of volume and pricing, and both may increase significantly through the rest of 2016. The analyst initiated coverage of Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) with an Outperform rating and a price target of $25. Woodworth mentioned that the company was the lowest cost flat rolled producer in the US, and had highest earnings leverage to a flat rolled market recovery. Credit Suisse initiated coverage of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) with an Outperform rating and a price target of $19. Woodworth expects the company to achieve margin expansion with a recovery in volumes. States Steel may outperform expectations for FCF and EBITDA in 2016. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) has been initiated with a Neutral rating and a price target of $16. The analyst cited downside risk to both merchant bar and rebar metal margins over the next few quarters as reason for the cautious stance. Woodworth initiated coverage of Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) with a Neutral rating and a price target of $42. Nucor’s sheet exposure is only 40 percent of volume. The analyst added, however, that the company is poised for strong growth in mid-2016, although plate markets continued to be weak and there was significant import pressure in rebar and MBQ. Credit Suisse initiated coverage of AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) with an Underperform Rating and a price target of $2. Woodworth said that AK Steel may struggle for the next several years due to structural challenges for US integrated producers as well as the company’s sizeable debt and legacy liabilities. Moreover, AK Steel has a high fixed cost base and Ashland could remain idle through at least Q216. Iron-Ore: Hold Your Breath While mentioning that iron prices were up 66 percent off their 2015 bottom, Woodworth mentioned that Credit Suisse's Commodities team was bearish on the medium-term iron-ore fundamentals. The price estimate for 2H16 is $35/tonne, “as Chinese demand remains structurally weak and a new wave of supply enters the market.” The analyst added that volume trends in the US remain bearish on account of significant structural challenges facing integrated producers. Woodworth initiated coverage of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF) with an Underperform rating and a price target of $1. He believes there is significant downside on balance sheet and valuation concerns. Cliffs’ shares are up 63 percent year-to-date, versus a 2 percent decline in the S&P500. The outperformance has been driven by iron ore seasonality, rather than company-specific factors, Woodworth commented. He added that while the company may have enough liquidity over the next 18-24 months, its liquidity position is likely to tighten significantly in 1Q17 and it may face a liquidity crunch in 2018. US Aluminum Sector Credit Suisse initiated coverage of the US Aluminum Sector with a bullish view on downstream markets and a cautiously optimistic view on upstream markets. “We believe upstream markets have bottomed owing to aggressive supply side curtailments and sharp declines in Chinese supply growth,” Woodworth wrote. The coverage of Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA) has been initiated with an Outperform rating and a price target of $13. The stock is significantly undervalued based on SOTP analysis, the analyst mentioned. Alcoa has plans to split into 2 separate companies in 2H16. As primary aluminum recovers, there could be upside to the price target. Woodworth initiated coverage of Constellium NV (NYSE: CSTM) with an Outperform rating and a price target of $10. The analyst named this stock as the top idea in the aluminum sector, citing its depressed valuation and positive near-term catalysts. He added, “We expect CSTM to de-risk the Wise acquisition by creating a JV for future BiW growth and reducing capex via increased merchant / in-house supply.” Credit Suisse initiated coverage of Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (NASDAQ: KALU) with a Neutral rating, and a price target of $85. Woodworth termed the stock as a defensive play, citing the company’s favorable macro exposure to aerospace / automotive light weighting as well as best-in-class ROIC and FCF generation. The rating reflects the stock’s rich valuation."

2016-03-11,Credit Suisse Bullish On Steel Sector,"Credit Suisse’s Curt Woodworth initiated coverage of the US Steel Sector with a bullish view. He mentioned that the US market seemed to be close to a cyclical low point for volume and pricing, and the outlook for both is very strong for the rest of 2016. Global demand seems to be in a strong recovery mode, backed by a seasonal upswing in Chinese demand, while there has been a slow ramp in global supply following curtailments during end-2015. Global prices have surged over the past several months and “we believe US prices are likely to experience the strongest recovery as not only will prices increase with the global market but premiums to foreign material should expand from trade case protection,” analyst Curt Woodworth wrote. Outperform Ratings The price target for Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) is at $25. The company is America’s lowest cost flat rolled producer, with the highest earnings leverage to a recovery in the US flat rolled market. The analyst expects EAF metals spreads for sheet products to widen significantly in 2Q, providing EPS upside to Street expectations. Steel Dynamics has strong potential for organic growth on mix upgrades. The price target for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) is at $19. The company is expected to generate high incremental margins as volume recovers. Woodworth believes that States Steel would beat FCF and EBITDA expectations for 2016. The company has the highest leverage to spot market recovery, he added. Neutral Ratings The price target for Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) is at $16. Metals spreads in rebar and MBQ are weakening, while US non-residential construction trends remain mixed, the analyst said. The price target for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) is at $42. Although the company’s sheet exposure is merely 40 percent of volume, it is well positioned for robust growth in mid-2016, Woodworth mentioned. He added, however, that plate markets remained very weak and there was significant import pressure in rebar and MBQ. Underperform Rating The price target for AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) is at $2. “AK Steel’s high fixed cost base, slab short position, and Ashland outage are major headwinds” and the company is expected to burn cash at rate of $43mm in 2016 and $109mm in 2017, Woodworth commented."

What It Means While the final decision is not slated until August 3, the tariff decisions have been in the works since August 2015. In regards to what the tariff means and what the decisions imply, Bank of America explained, As a result of the expected tariff decision, imports slowed into year-end 2015. Related Link: Credit Suisse Bullish On Steel Sector These declines in addition to mill curtailments and seasonal demand have contributed to a tighter market. Import volumes already fell on the back of the investigations, yet we would expect some further net declines as Brazil and Australian imports fall, even as Turkish and Japanese tons perhaps rise, said Bank of America. For the near term, Bank of America anticipates relative strength, but questions its sustainability. We recently got more conviction on sheet price upward momentum after channel checks this week suggested markets have gotten tighter, the firm said. While rising prices can invite more imports and capacity to restart, we see a delay before any incremental tons can affect the market. Through May U.S. domestic prices may continue to rise, after which upward momentum could be challenged by seasonally slower demand, restarts, and or/higher imports. A Few Names The industry note highlighted Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) specifically, indicating a 12-month price objective of $23 per share and justified given the greater cash flow outlook ahead, more diversified geographic/end market mix, and potential Columbus deal-related synergies. Bank of America currently has a Buy rating on Steel Dynamics. Other Buy-rated names in the space include: Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (NASDAQ: KALU) Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

2016-03-21,Jefferies Downgrades Steel Giants En Masse,"Despite recent evidence that the steel market is improving, bolstered by near-term upside, Jefferies issued an industry note, broadly downgrading top steel companies. Jefferies cited seasonal restocking, demand growth and mounting protectionist trade barriers as all near-term tailwinds. However, the analysts remain cautious, [W]e fear momentum may run out of steam into summer. Following a strong run of equity performance for US steelmakers, valuations are increasingly hard to justify. Downgrades Therefore, the firm downgraded Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE: RS), Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC), Olympic Steel, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZEUS) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) to Hold for the first three and Underperform for the last, respectively. Related Link: U.S. Metals: Balancing A Constructive Domestic Macro Environment Against China Risks Regarding U.S. Steel, Jefferies stated, Following a strong rally YTD, we downgrade X to Underperform as the company's stretched valuation appears hard to justify in the absence of a more meaningful price recovery than forecast […] we expect X to underperform peers as steel price momentum dissipates into summer. Speaking toward the three downgrades to Hold, Jefferies commented, Despite an improving steel market outlook after a deep Q4 trough, strong YTD equity performance leaves sector valuation hard to justify at 8.8x 2016 EV/EBITDA vs historical ave 6.7x. The downgrades to Hold reflect increasingly stretched vals on both 2016 and even 2017 earnings in addition to relatively less incremental exposure to recovering flat steel prices than seen amongst peers. Others In addition to the four downgrades, Jefferies' note commented that the firm currently holds Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) as top picks in the space. While STLD and NUE vals are lofty, we continue to see incremental upside as investors seek out higher-quality exposure to recovering prices backed by strong FCF and balance sheets, the analysts elaborated, Further, should price momentum disappoint into summer and bring a valuation correction, STLD & NUE stand out with the most defensive risk/reward. At Time Of Writing… Steel Dynamics was seen down 0.89 percent at $21.69. Nucor was seen down 1.71 percent at $45.90. Reliance Steel & Aluminum was down 2.68 percent at $68.28. Olympic Steel was down 2.90 percent at $16.39. Commercial Metals was down 4.23 percent at $16.43. U.S. Steel was down 5.33 percent at $14.92."
2016-03-23,"These Steel Numbers Just 'Escalated Quickly,' Are You Buying?","Credit Suisse’s Curt Woodworth said that the global steel market is rebalancing swiftly, after last year’s fallout from the energy market, substantial destocking, and distressed exports from China. Over the past several weeks, global HRC prices have risen to ~$370/ton, with global CRC prices approaching $500/ton. “Turkish scrap and Chinese billet prices also continue to move higher providing cost support,” analyst Curt Woodworth wrote. US Flat Rolled Woodworth expects US HRC prices to reach $480/ton and CRC price to approach $640/ton by the end of 2Q16, before trending lower in the back half of the year, as the supply chain normalizes. The US market has the most robust fundamentals among the global steel market over the rest of this year. Restocking, import share gains and end demand growth are expected to drive domestic flat rolled volumes sharply higher in 2016. Flat Rolled Import “In the past two weeks, CIS and China export prices increased by $60-80/tonne for CRC and many foreign mills are restricting export quotes until prices settle in Asia,” the analyst mentioned. United States Steel Corporation: A Top Pick Woodworth maintained an Outperform rating for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), while raising the price target from $19 to $22. He said that the company has the highest operating and financial leverage to a recovery in the US steel sector. Every 5 percent increase in volume and $50/ton move in ASP impacts the company’s annual EBITDA by ~$400mm. The analyst expressed optimism regarding US Steel being able to capture a significant share from imports and the restock opportunity set in 2016. “Given US Steel's high fixed cost base, we believe incremental margins will be very high near 40-50% as volumes start to recover,” the Credit Suisse report added. Steel Dynamics Woodworth maintained an Outperform rating for Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), while raising the price target from $25 to $27. He expects the shares to trade above historical average multiples, backed by the company’s “compelling growth potential in value add sheet and product mix upgrades in the long product markets of SBQ and rail.” The analyst believes that the company is “uniquely positioned” to leverage its robust balance sheet for additional organic growth projects as well as acquisitions. AK Steel Credit Suisse maintained an Underperform rating for AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), while raising the price target from $2.00 to $3.50. Woodworth noted that the company has about 10-15 percent exposure to the direct spot market and about 20 percent of the contract customer base has price levels linked to published indices. The adjusted EBITDA estimate for 2016 has been raised from $238mm to $352mm to reflect higher volumes and pricing in value add sheet. Nucor The analyst maintained a Neutral rating for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), while raising the price target from $42 to $45. He said that Nucor’s mid-quarter update had beaten expectations and the company had indicated that profitability should improve in 2016. “We viewed this very positively for Nucor given the large hurdle the company faces on LIFO (~$60mm charge forecast for 2016 vs $467mm benefit in 2015). While we remain cautious on the outlook for long products and plate, Nucor has significant leverage to the flat rolled market where metal spreads have widened significantly over the past month,” Woodworth wrote."
2016-03-23,Be Warned Metals Investors: Deutsche Bank Just Moved To The Sidelines,"Deutsche Bank’s Jorge Beristain mentioned that although commodity prices had rallied year-to-date, supply cuts are required across most commodities, while companies need to focus on reducing debt levels. The commodity price rally year-to-date has been driven by incrementally positive data from China. This trend is unlikely to continue, analyst Jorge Beristain commented, while adding that supply cuts were needed across most commodities. The good news is that the higher commodity prices had resulted in a significant tightening of credit spreads, which had opened “a window of opportunity.” Beristain expects further equity issuances and debt refinancing going ahead, “as the sector continues to re-shape.” Barrick Gold Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE: ABX) – downgraded from Buy to Hold. Barrick’s performance has been sluggish following its decision to acquire copper producer Equinox Minerals for $7.4bn in April 2011. Beristain mentioned, however, that Barrick had taken “significant steps to restructure its portfolio and streamline its operating model.” The company made several asset sales to reduce debt and achieve its $3bn target for 2015. It has planned a $2bn debt reduction for 2016. Hecla Mining Hecla Mining Company (NYSE: HL) – downgraded from Buy to Hold. “The company's primary growth initiative is the development of the #4 Shaft at Lucky Friday which could increase output from ~3m oz to ~5m oz and extend mine life beyond 2030,” Beristain wrote. The downgrade is based on valuation and the Hold rating reflects a balanced risk-reward. Pan American Silver Pan American Silver Corp. (USA) (NASDAQ: PAAS) – downgraded from Buy to Hold. “Pan American's medium term outlook depends on continued cost reduction efforts and successful execution of brownfield expansion at La Colorada and the Dolores Pulp agglomeration,” the analyst comment. The company has a robust balance sheet, which offers it significant flexibility to pursue acquisitions, which could translate into substantial value for its shareholders. The downgrade is based on valuation and the Hold rating reflects a balanced risk-reward. Coeur Mining Coeur Mining Inc (NYSE: CDE) – downgraded from Hold to Sell. “Management has partially transformed Coeur in terms of its balance sheet and asset quality. The near term outlook is dependent on steady state operations at Kensington and Palmarejo and the brownfield expansion at Rochester,” the Credit Suisse report noted. The downgrade follows the recent run up in the company’s shares. Reliance Steel Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE: RS) – downgraded from Buy to Hold. “The company's focus on small, quick turnaround orders, value-added processing and opportunistic growth/diversification strategy has enabled it to maintain industry-leading through the cycle operational performance,” Beristain mentioned. He added that Reliance had attractive end-market exposure, was likely to generate robust FCFs, had a healthy balance sheet and its long-term organic and inorganic growth potential was significant. The downgrade in rating is based on valuation. Nucor Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) - downgraded from Buy to Hold. The price target has been raised from $48 to $50. The analyst wrote, “Despite the company's leverage to NA construction market recovery, favorable cost position and investment grade balance sheet, we rate Nucor a Hold on valuation.” Freeport-McMoRan Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX) – Rated Hold. The price target has been raised from $6 to $9. Freeport’s O&G portfolio is now “evenly split between mature cash-flowing California assets and high growth, long life, Gulf of Mexico (GoM) assets,” the Credit Suisse report stated. Beristain added, however, that declining O&G prices had exerted pressure on the company’s balance sheet, despite efforts like equity issuance, stake sale and reduction in costs and capex. AK Steel AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) – Rated Sell. The price target has been raised from $1 to $2. On September 16, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Severstal's Dearborn integrated plant for $690m in cash, funded through a combination of debt and equity. The deal expands AK Steel's annual steel shipping capacity, provides scale and operational flexibility and strengthens the company’s position in the automotive grade steel market. “However, we rate AK Steel a Sell due to higher cost structure and Balance Sheet risks,” Beristain said. Steel Dynamics Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) – Rated Buy. The price target has been raised from $23 to $25. On September 16, 2014, Steel Dynamics completed the acquisition of Severstal's Columbus mini-mill for ~$1.7bn in cash. The deal expanded Steel Dynamics’ annual steel shipping capacity by ~40 percent to 11m tons. “We rate Steel Dynamics a Buy, citing industry-leading cost structure, attractive product mix and exposure to recovering construction market,” the analyst wrote. United States Steel Corporation United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) – Rated Sell. The price target has been raised from $4.50 to $8. “US Steel has been swift in tackling recent headwinds (depressed oil prices, elevated inventories and high imports), by undertaking maintenance outages and idling/adjusting production rates across other facilities,” Beristain mentioned. He added, however, that the company’s efforts to reduce costs have been insufficient to offset the impact of lower pricing and reduced volumes. Allegheny Technologies Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE: ATI) – Rated Hold. The price target has been raised from $10 to $13. The company produces niche products and has exposure to differentiated end-markets, such as aerospace and defense, chemical processing, oil & gas and power generation. Century Aluminum Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ: CENX) – Rated Hold. The price target has been raised from $6 to $7. Beristain expects the company to produce ~740k tons in 2016. Moreover, Century Aluminum has a carbon anode facility in Netherlands and a 40 percent stake in a plant in China. The analyst expressed concern, however, regarding an anticipated decline in the company’s earnings through 2016 to 2018, due to commodity price headwinds."
2016-03-26,U.S.-China Steel Price Spread At Multi-Year Low: Here's How To Play It,"In a new report, JPMorgan analyst Michael Gambardella takes a look at the shrinking U.S. price premium on steel versus China. According to the report, the hot-rolled coil (HRC) spread has dipped to only $54/ton, its lowest level in three years. “The main drivers of the narrowing are higher Chinese steel prices, which reflect a pickup in demand and lower supply with low steel output and inventors levels,” Gambardella explains. Related Link: IEA: The Next Oil Price Shock Could Be To The Upside The U.S./China HRC spread was as high as $233/ton as recently as 2014. Chinese steel prices have spiked 33 percent in the past week from $300/mt to $400/mt. A pickup in Chinese steel demand and improving sentiment are the primary reasons for the spike. In the U.S., JPMorgan expects that steel prices will continue to climb throughout 2016 due to domestic supply cuts and reductions in imports. Gambardella notes that, since China accounts for about half of global steel production, rising Chinese prices are certainly a boost for U.S. producers. However, he adds that high Chinese prices are not a critical part of the bull thesis for U.S. producers. JPMorgan names United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) as its top steel stock picks.

2016-04-05,"Major Steel Players Set For Better 2017, JPMorgan Says","Higher steel prices have set the stage for improved performances by the major players in the Steel industry. JPMorgan’s Michael F. Gambardell commented on four Steel majors, revisiting their estimates. US Steel Analyst Michael Gambardell maintained an Overweight rating for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), while raising the estimates for 2017 and the price target to $28. “We continue to believe that domestic steel sheet prices should be supported by U.S. supply cuts in the form of reduced imports from positive sheet trade case rulings as well as domestic capacity curtailments,” Gambardell wrote. AK Steel The analyst maintained an Overweight rating for AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), while raising the EPS estimate for 2017 and reinstating the price target at $6. He said that US carbon sheet steel prices were rising, backed by domestic production cuts, declining imports due to positive preliminary duties from the three sheet trade cases, and China’s improving steel metrics. “By themselves, we believe production cuts and lower U.S. imports are enough to push carbon steel sheet prices higher in the US, and we expect structurally higher prices going forward,” Gambardell commented. Nucor JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), while raising the EPS estimate for 2017 and the price target to $55. Gambardell believes mini-mills like Nucor would continue to witness margin expansion, with steel prices increasing faster than scrap prices. “US steel prices should continue to be supported by supply cuts in the form of reduced imports due to positive sheet trade case rulings as well as domestic capacity curtailments,” the analyst stated. He explained that although scrap prices are likely to rise, the increase will not be at the same rate as the rise in US steel prices, since the strong USD makes it more difficult for the US to export scrap. Steel Dynamics Gambardell maintained an Overweight rating for Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), while raising the 2017 EPS estimate and the price target to $29, citing higher steel prices."

2016-06-06,U.S. Treasury Secretary Blames Excess Steel Capacity For Global Markets' Distortions; Steel Stocks On The Move,"U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew blames the distortion in the global markets on excess steel production in China, according to an Associated Press report. Lew urged China on Monday to cut excess steel production, as the two sides opened a high-level dialogue overshadowed by tension over the South China Sea, reported the AP. The United States and trading partners are blaming China for flooding low-cost steel into their markets, threatening thousands of jobs. To counter the cheap steel influx, the United States has imposed anti-dumping tariffs, while European officials say they are looking further into the issue. Related Link: The Market In 5 Minutes: Float Like A Butterfly, Sting Like A Bee Excess capacity has a distorting and damaging effect on global markets, Lew said. And implementing policies to substantially reduce production in a range of sectors suffering from overcapacity, including steel and aluminum, is critical to the function and stability of international markets. The AP said Chinese President Xi Jinping, while speaking at the event's opening ceremony, promised action on reducing overcapacity but announced no new initiatives. The report said, The annual meeting of Cabinet-level foreign affairs, trade and other officials from both sides is meant to head off conflict. The sides also called for closer cooperation between the two biggest economies on climate, global finance, agriculture and other fields.

2016-06-08,Credit Suisse Upgrades Steel Stocks On Increasing U.S. Steel Price,"“We remain very bullish on the US steel industry,” Credit Suisse’s Curt Woodworth said in a report, while significantly raising the spot and contract price deck. The analyst expects the US flat rolled market to continue to tighten over the next several months. Analyst Curt Woodworth said that investors seem to be underestimating structural change in the US sheet market. He named the top picks as AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD). AK Steel Woodworth upgraded the rating for AK Steel from Underperform to Outperform, saying that the company had underappreciated spot leverage and was poised to benefit significantly from stronger contract prices in 2017. The price target has been raised from $3.50 to $7, reflecting higher EBITDA and FCF estimates. Previous concerns related to liquidity had been alleviated following the company’s recent equity offering. The analyst believes AK Steel is in a “strong position to de-lever the balance sheet over the next several years and selectively repurchase longer dated debt at a discount to par value.” He forecasted significant FCF generation over the next several years. US Steel Woodworth maintained an Outperform rating for US Steel, while raising the price target from $22 to $26. He expects the company to be able to “recapture most of the contract ASP headwind from 2016.” The analyst raised the 2016 and 2017 EBITDA estimates to $640mm and $1.2bn, respectively, reflecting the revised price deck, higher 2017 contract prices, and improved conversion cost metrics associated with higher utilization rate expectations. The FCF forecasts are at $281mm and $387mm, respectively. Steel Dynamics Credit Suisse maintained an Outperform rating for Steel Dynamics, while raising the price target from $27 to $33. “In our view, STLD has compelling upside over the medium term as the company continues to expand capacity and upgrade product mix within the US value add sheet market,” Woodworth wrote. Metal spreads for US flat rolled products are likely to remain above mid-cycle levels through 2018, while a significant jump in volumes for both sheet and long products is likely to result in a strong improvement in conversion cost metrics. The EBITDA estimate for 2016 and 2017 have been raised to $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. “Importantly, STLD has compelling future organic and inorganic growth potential and we expect STLD to announce incremental projects to fully utilize spare hot metal capacity across its steel facility base,” the analyst added. Nucor Woodworth maintained a Neutral rating for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), while raising the price target from $45 to $55. He commented, “While we recognize that EBITDA growth in 2016 might be underappreciated, NUE's lower exposure to the healthiest steel products in the near term makes this a less compelling story in the space in our view.”"

2016-07-12,"U.S. Steel, Other Metals And Mining Reviewed By Barclays","Heading into the 2Q earnings season, commodity price estimates for steel have been raised. This has improved the earnings outlooks for steel companies, and resulted in an increase in the price targets of four steel stocks, Barclays’ Matthew J. Korn said in a report. The performance of metal stocks has recently been strong, albeit highly volatile, with mixed macro data from China and uncertainly over the US interest rate policy. “Our sense is that investors are going into 2H pleased with metal companies' operations, anticipating upward estimate revisions, but still concerned with just how long current steel and copper prices can hold,” analyst Matthew Korn wrote. Updated Estimates And Price Targets AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) – Rating maintained at Equal-weight, while price target raised from $4 to $5. The EPS estimates for FY1 and FY2 have been raised from -$0.07 to $0.26 and from $0.23 to $0.54, respectively. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) - Rating maintained at Overweight, while price target raised from $52 to $55. The EPS estimates for FY1 and FY2 have been raised from $1.98 to $2.81 and from $2.84 to $2.88, respectively. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) - Rating maintained at Overweight, while price target raised from $27 to $28. The EPS estimates for FY1 and FY2 have been raised from $1.55 to $2.01 and from $1.93 to $1.99, respectively. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) - Rating maintained at Equal-weight, while price target raised from $15 to $16. The EPS estimates for FY1 and FY2 have been raised from -$2.86 to -$1.01 and from -$0.03 to $0.57, respectively. The price targets have been raised to reflect that domestic steel prices had held above $600 per ton. “Chinese steel prices have cycled up and down again, but in the U.S. reduced capacity, limited imports, and low inventories have kept sheet tags elevated,” Korn wrote. The analyst expects HRC to decline about 13 percent to an average of $545 per ton over 2017. He added that there were “some early signs of softening from weaker scrap, shrinking lead times, and a recent step up in imports.” Despite these factors, the mini-mills were gaining market share, achieving margin expansion, and growing via new projects and targeted M&A, Korn noted.

2016-07-19,Steel Dynamics Q2 Earnings Report Reviewed By Clarksons Analysts,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) reported better-than-expected results for the second quarter, despite a challenging industry environment. Earnings And Guidance Steel Dynamics reported adjusted EPS of $0.58, above the top end of management's guidance range of $0.53–$0.57 and the Street's $0.56 consensus. Exceptionally high mill utilization of 95 percent allowed for solid unit cost control, and masked generally challenged long product demand, Clarksons Platou analyst Lee McMillan wrote in a note. The company's steel production utilization rate rose to 95 percent in the second quarter, well above the domestic industry average of 74 percent and the 88 percent in the first quarter. Steel ops metal margin rose by $23/ton versus first quarter to $413/ton, as pricing rose faster than scrap. Related Link: Barclays Adjusts Price Targets On AK Steel, CONSOL Energy And Others Operating margins rose sequentially by $57/ton to $121/ton, due in part to a very solid unit cost performance buoyed by the high utilization. McMillan views the result as a narrow beat versus consensus and believes the sustainability of high utilization numbers will be a key area of focus for the investors. Looking Forward Looking ahead, commentary was somewhat mixed, citing moderated customer inventories and low import levels as reasons to expect improved flat roll metal spreads in the third quarter. However, long product steel demand was generally challenged with selling values under pressure from excess domestic production capability. McMillan has a Neutral rating and $24 price target on the stock, which, at time of writing, was down 5.43 percent on the day at $26.46. Did you like this article? Could it have been improved?

2016-07-20,Axiom Analyst Considers Steel Demand Headwinds As Chinese Home Prices Flatline,"Home price growth in China is now declining, and this is an industry-wide headwind for the steel sector. Gordon Johnson of Axiom, a research firm that specializes in metals, mining and mining equipment, commented in a note on Tuesday that the declining home price growth in China should give pause to commodity bulls. Johnson added that while China's home price data is important to follow, the more important metric in terms of commodity demand is new housing starts. The analyst added that China's June data indicates a strong year-to-date growth in housing starts at 7.3 percent year-over-year. However, this could be attributed to the culmination of a record first quarter 2016 credit deluge and should revert back into negative territory this year. Related Link: A Fundamental Case For The Steel ETF At this point, many investors are likely asking why this data set is vital to the steel sector. As explained by Johnson, China's residential real estate sector accounts for 36 percent of the country's steel demand. The analyst expanded that if China's new home figures start to fall 5 percent year-over-year throughout the entire 2016, then total steel demand in the country will fall by approximately 12 million mt of steel, or approximately 20 million mt of displaced iron ore demand. Bottom line, the analyst cautioned that the housing data out of China is a bad omen for steel demand. Did you like this article? Could it have been improved?

2016-07-20,"'As Good As It Gets' In Nucor, Bank Of America Says; Downgrades To Neutral","Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) to Neutral from Buy due to a more cautious view on second-half market conditions, fuller valuation and cautious comments from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) on long products. Justification The downgrade comes as Nucor is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on July 21. The Street expects EPS of $0.70 on revenue of $4.50 billion. We continue to think NUE represents a relatively attractive investment opportunity within our coverage, but expect limited catalysts on falling steel prices and more recent full valuation, analyst Timna Tanners wrote in a note. Related Link: Barclays Adjusts Price Targets On AK Steel, CONSOL Energy And Others On Thursday's second-quarter call, the analyst said investors will focus on how much spare capacity Nucor might be able to contribute to a relatively tight sheet market after the company reportedly operated at 105 percent of capacity at its sheet mills. We expect benign market commentary, similar to STLD, although our channel checks indicate gaps of $145–200/t on delivered sheet imports relative to domestic prices. We would be keen for an update on NUE's plans for cash use given its also substantial cash hoard of $2.3 billion as of Q116, Tanners noted. Meanwhile, the analyst added that Nucor has more long products exposure than Steel Dynamics, but less than Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) at about 39 percent of 2015 sales, and has also been growing volumes in its fabricated segment. Looking Forward NUE remains relatively defensive due to variable costs and LIFO earnings, which can help offset any hit from falling prices. It also tends to import scrap, so can benefit on the margin from a stronger dollar arbitrage on scrap costs, Tanners highlighted. That said, the analyst cut 2016 EPS view to reflect expected long product margin squeeze into the second quarter and lower volumes in the third. Tanners lowered 2016 EPS forecast to $2.40 from $2.45. The analyst also trimmed 2016 revenue estimate to $18.39 billion from $18.44 billion. Average selling prices can be supported for the near term from trailing contract prices, but we expect lower prices into Q4E on our view that lower global prices ultimately pressure a lofty U.S. premium lower, Tanners added. Tanners, however, maintained the stock's price objective of $56. At time of writing, Nucor shares were down 2.62 percent on the day, trading at $54.25. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

2016-07-21,Bank Of America Sours On Steel,"Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded steel stocks such as Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) on softer steel prices. Analyst Timna Tanners has cut the rating of Nucor shares to Neutral from Buy on the steel price outlook, cautious long product views and valuation. However, Tanners maintains a $56 price objective on Nucor shares. Related Link: As Good As It Gets In Nucor, Bank Of America Says; Downgrades To Neutral Tanners also downgraded Steel Dynamics to Neutral from Buy after a strong rise in share prices on the view that steel prices have run out of steam. The analyst also cut the price target on the stock by $1 to $28. Q2 results were a beat, but the outlook was softer than expected and we lowered estimates and see consensus at risk. We continue to like STLD on a relative basis, but expect discounted import tons to pressure sheet steel markets into Q4, Tanners wrote in a note. Tanners slashed 2016 EPS forecast to $1.90 from $2.00, compared with consensus of $2.13, and third-quarter EPS view fell to $0.57 from $0.66 versus consensus at $0.72. Aluminum Outlook Likewise Murky Meanwhile, analyst PT Luther has downgraded Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (NASDAQ: KALU) to Neutral from Buy on cloudier aerospace outlook. We downgrade KALU to Neutral on our view that key aero and auto end markets are in the latter stages of prolonged upcycles, Luther noted. The analyst, who also pointed to typically slower second half, cut 2017 EBITDA estimate to $207 million from $213 million. The analyst also lowered 2017–18 EPS estimates to $6.00/$6.40 from $6.20/$7.00. Luther also trimmed price objective on Kaiser shares by $2 to $92. At Time Of Writing... Kaiser closed Wednesday trading down 3.64 percent at $85.57 and showed no trades in Thursday's pre-market. Nucor closed Wednesday down 2.91 percent at $54.09. Steel Dynamics closed down 1.45 percent at $26.46. None of the three showed any trades in Thursday's pre-market. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Did you like this article?

2016-07-26,U.S. Steel Beats Estimates; Axiom's Johnson Fears Fundamentals Are Being Ignored In Steel Names,"After the close on Tuesday, United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) reported a Q2 adjusted loss of $0.32 per share versus estimates of a $0.53 loss. Revenues were $2.58 billion and the Street was looking for $2.67 billion. Steel names have reported better-than-consensus estimates this quarter, as many were expecting on the heels of surging steel prices: AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) beat by $0.10 Reliant Steel (NYSE: RS) beat by $0.08 Nucor (NYSE: NUE) beat by $0.03 Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) beat by $0.02 There's good reason for the recent slew of strong reports, according to Axiom's Gordon Johnson. Johnson spoke with Benzinga Tuesday and he said restructuring charges, which are backed out of Non-GAAP numbers and viewed as one-time charges (even though they are real costs), are showing that the business fundamentals are lacking for steel names in general as any benefits to the bottom line have been driven primarily through pent up spot price. Shares of U.S. Steel were up $0.68 or 2.96 percent to $22.95 in after-hours trading. During the day, shares rose $1.64 or 7.70 percent to $22.95."
2016-07-27,Axiom's Johnson Says U.S. Steel Mills Have Gone Too Far With Current Regulations; Maintains Bearish Outlook,"United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) reported its second-quarter results after Tuesday's market close, which proved to be better than expected. United States Steel wasn't alone in reporting a better-than-expected earnings report, and many of its peers also surprised to the upside. Benzinga reached out to Axiom's Gordon Johnson to discuss what is going on in the steel sector. Gordon Johnson On Steel According to Johnson, steel investors shouldn't hold on to an optimistic view moving forward. The analyst stated that the second quarter of a calendar year typically marks peak optimism in the steel space. Related Link: Credit Suisse Sees 26% Upside In U.S. Steel Meanwhile, auto demand (a key sector client of most steel clients) is weakening, imports are on the rise, oil prices are moving lower and there will be an impact from the Brexit vote — no matter how small. Johnson added that the market is ignoring all of these industry headwinds and it won't last forever. The analyst also suggested that the dividends offered by steel companies are not safe for the foreseeable future. Many steel companies are highly leveraged and operate with high fixed costs associated with plant maintenance. Finally, Johnson doesn't see any new regulation that could support steel prices. He stated that imported steel into the United States is now seen as on par with U.S. produced steel to the point where it is hard for steel mills not to buy imports. The US mills have went too far, and now there will be a flood of imports in 2H16 pushing steel prices lower yet again, the analyst concluded. Steel is a commodity, and the US is not the price setter. It is the price taker. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

2016-08-22,Steel Dynamics Has 33% Upside According To Citi,"According to Citi’s Alexander Hacking, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) “is one of the lowest cost operators in the US with its relatively younger and highly productive EAF mills that use a largely non-union labor force with pay tied to performance.” Hacking initiated coverage of the company with a Buy rating and price target of $33. The Positives The analyst pointed out that Steel Dynamics has been generating mill EBITDA margins 5 percent above the industry average over the last five-year and 10-year period. The company has also been investing internally in “smaller scale, lower-risk and short payback organic projects” in order to improve its value-added mix and also help up new end-markets, while supporting margins. Related Link: Steel Dynamics Completes Acquisition Of Vulcan Threaded Products Hacking also mentioned that Steel Dynamics has been focusing on M&A, especially downstream opportunities that can “generate pull through demand for their mills and have EBITDA margins above the company average.” The analyst pointed out that the company’s growth initiatives are being supported by the relatively low leverage, consistent track record of FCF generation and record liquidity. Some Negatives Too On the other hand, overall operating margins have decline from the 16 percent seen in 2004–2008 to about 5–7 percent since 2010. “In addition to a decline in Steel Mill segment margins across the industry, the purchase of OmniSource in 2007 and the Mesabi Nugget investment have been large contributors to declining margins and ROIC,” Hacking noted.

2016-09-15,"Jefferies Staying Defensive On Steel Sector, Highlights Expectation For A Weak End To The Year","Steel valuation multiples would likely compress further in the near term, until pricing bottoms out, Jefferies’ Seth Rosenfeld said in a report. Although the rise in steel prices would result in solid Q3 earnings and guidance, steel shares could remain under pressure due to “the recent inflection in steel pricing and bearish survey outlook,” the analyst commented. Analyst Rosenfeld expects the derating of steel valuations to persist through the second half of 2016. Recovery Likely In 2017 US steel prices have been following a downward trajectory through Q3 due to lower raw material input costs, higher flat rolled imports and a seasonally weak demand environment. Rosenfeld expects the downturn to continue through yearend due to “incremental weakness in raw material input costs as well as supply-side pressures from ramping capacity.” A revised analysis of the flat rolled market indicates opportunity for producers to regain pricing power in the first half of 2017. Top Picks The analyst named Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) has the top and most defensive picks. He maintained Buy ratings on both stocks, although reducing their price targets from $31 to $28 for Steel Dynamics and from $60 to $55 for Nucor. The companies have lower cost operating structures and less levered balance sheets. “We concede shares will likely remain pressured near term, but expect better relative performance and ultimately absolute upside when pricing stabilizes,” Rosenfeld wrote. Worst Affected The analyst stated that integrated mills United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) were highly sensitive to absolute steel prices and faced margin risk from surging coking coal prices. Thus, these stocks would likely “face the brunt of the downside pressure.” Jefferies maintained Hold ratings on the companies, while reducing the price targets for US Steel from $24.50 to $18 and for AK Steel from $5.50 to $4.50. Other Ratings Rosenfeld maintained Hold ratings for these stocks, with the following price targets: Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) – Maintained at $16.50 Olympic Steel, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZEUS) – Lowered from $25 to $20 Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE: RS) - Maintained at $72 Ryerson Holding Corp (NYSE: RYI) – Cut from $14.50 to $12 Timkensteel Corp (NYSE: TMST) – Lowered from $11 to $9.75 Worthington Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WOR) - Maintained at $37 Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga? Please email feedback@benzinga.com with your best article ideas.

2016-09-20,The Current Environment In The Steel Space,"Steel stocks may not live up to the phrase steely nerves if recent indications from some top companies in the sector are anything to go by. As recently as Monday, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) pre-announced an earnings shortfall for the third quarter. Earlier in the month, Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) also projected an earnings shortfall despite the metric suggesting strong year-over-year growth. Jefferies Sees Price Weakness In a note published last week, Jefferies said valuation of steel stocks will compress further as unit prices bottom out. The bearish outlook and the recent inflection in steel pricing could pressure stocks in the sector despite expectations of solid third-quarter earnings and forward guidance due to higher steel prices. Steel prices in the United States have dived, pressured by higher flat-rolled imports in recent months, low raw material costs and seasonal weakness in demand. Jefferies sees the weakness facing the steel industry as persisting through the year, as there is pressure from supply side to ramp up capacity. Related Link: A Surprise Among Utilities ETFs CLSA Also Cribs On Price Weakness CLSA said it sees steel prices dropping further as lead times shrink, boosting output, and raw material prices remain soft. Risk Preference May Help However, KeyBanc raised the sector rating of the steel sector to Sector Weight from Underweight Monday. The firm said it remains cautious on the group but believes the risk-reward in the steel sector is finely balanced. Investor proclivity toward risk, according to the firm, has become a positive factor for the sector. The firm also indicated that the sector experiences seasonal momentum in the fourth quarter of the calendar year and early first quarter. Are Stocks Wilting Amid Muted Opinions? Nucor has not had much movement over the last week, although it did slip to a low of $45.35 in the aftermath of the earnings warning. Since then, the stock has recovered and is currently trading around $46. Steel Dynamics also traded in a $23–$24 range, and Monday's pre-announcement issued after the market open is pushing the stock down by close to 1 percent to $24.09. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) has pulled back from above $17 over last week and is currently down about 1 percent at $16.64. Meanwhile, AKS Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) has seen its shares a constant above $4 since the middle of August. Since September 9, the Arca Steel Index (NYSE:GIS:STEEL) has lost about 1.5 percent, while during the same period, the S&P 500 Index has gained about 0.50 percent.

2016-09-21,Steel Dynamics Price Target Trimmed At CLSA On Weak Guidance,"CLSA lowered its estimates for Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) while also reducing its price target on the shares of the company. The reason behind the move is the company's recent negative pre-announcement. Margin Growth Vs. Lower Shipments Analyst Xiao Feng noted that third-quarter earnings are likely to see sequential improvement, as higher margins from steel operation helped overcome the impact of lower shipments. The improvement in steel realization, according the firm, may help counter higher scrap costs. Related Link: The Current Environment In The Steel Space Mixed End Markets CLSA highlighted Steel Dynamics' commentary of weaker heavy equipment, agriculture and energy markets, continued growth in the construction market, weak steel production hurting earnings of metals recycling operations and sequential margin compression impacting fabrication business. Low Demand To Hurt Steel Prices CLSA also noted that weak demand will weigh on steel prices. The firm noted that inventories at U.S. service centers measured in terms of months of shipments fell in August, seen a function extra shipping days in the month, and total shipments were higher month-over-month but down year-over-year. Estimates, Price Target Trimmed As such, CLSA lowered its third-quarter earnings per estimate to $0.65 from $0.70 and its 2016 earnings per share estimate to $2 from $2.13, premising the action on weak steel demand. The firm also reduced its 2017 earnings per share estimate to $2.10 from $2.20.

2016-09-22,Barclays Maintains Overweight On Steel Dynamics As Q3 Guidance Largely Expected,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) guided to lower flat-rolled volumes and a sequentially worse recycling performance for Q3. The guidance overall was largely as anticipated, Barclays’ Matthew J. Korn said in a report. He maintained an Overweight rating on the company, with a price target of $30. Steel Dynamics projected its Q3 EPS at $0.63-$0.67, lower than Barclay’s estimate of $0.69 and the consensus expectation of $0.71. “Most of the language given in this update matches the outlook given in the 2Q release,” analyst Korn noted. Lower Volumes The company did indicate weaker flat-rolled volumes, which was similar to the recent guidance provided by Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE). Recycling Performance The main change was the guidance of a weaker performance in Recycling, Korn mentioned. He added that Steel Dynamics has been witnessing a decline in ferrous and nonferrous volumes in this business during the quarter, while lower scrap prices are adversely impacting ferrous Recycling margins. Other Guidance “For core steel ops STLD expects “meaningful spread expansion” offset by lower volumes, in line with our prior expectations. End market commentary was unchanged as energy, agriculture, and heavy equipment remain weak while relative strength in auto and construction markets continues,” the analyst wrote. Estimates Revised The near-term outlook for steel stocks appears “quite soft,” with steel prices declining, scrap prices not providing much support, imports rising, and signs of weakening end-market demand, Korn stated. He lowered the EPS estimates for Q3 and 2016 from $0.69 to $0.66 and from $2.07 to $2.05, respectively. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

2016-09-27,"10 Notable Stocks Trading Ex-Dividend Wednesday, September 28","It’s critical to know whether a stock you plan on buying has an ex-dividend status, because in case it does, the dividend would be paid out to the seller. The person who owns the stock on the ex-dividend date will be awarded the payment, which means that you’ll have to wait for the next dividend cycle to receive your first dividend payout from the company. On the other hand, share prices typically decline just after the ex-dividend date is declared, and usually by an amount equal to the expected dividend. So, this may give you the opportunity to identify a good entry point. If you’re planning on selling shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you'll receive the dividend payout from the company.

2016-10-21,"A Rebound In Steel Prices Is Already Baked Into Steel Dynamics Value, Says Bank Of America","A rebound in steel prices is already priced into the shares of Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch note from Thursday. Analyst Timna Tanners noted that the company's CEO Mark Millet spoke of an approaching inflection point in steel prices. Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects third quarter peak-conditions metal margin performance of $489 per ton declining to $467 in the fourth quarter of 2016 and averaging at $457 per ton in 2017. Among the things the bank does like are its variable cost structure, steady margins, and exposure to growing non-residential construction market. However, the firm expressed discomfort at the high-margin, rail and engineered bar products. Citing weak volume outlook, the firm lowered its fourth quarter earnings per share estimate to $0.31 from $0.46. The 2017 estimate is reduced to $1.95 from $2. The firm attributed the Neutral rating to its view that steel prices are likely past the peak and volumes have also peaked. The price target was increased to $28 from $27.

2016-11-27,Trump Rally Keeps Shine On Steel Stocks,"The steely resolve that saw Donald Trump emerge victorious despite many writing him off seems to have caught on with the steel sector. The Market Vectors Steel (ETF) (NYSE: SLX) has been up over 18 percent since the November 8 elections. Most bellwethers stocks in the space are now either at or close to their multi-year highs. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) – Up about 58 percent and at its highest level in about two years. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) – Up about 25 percent and at an eight-year high AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) – Up about 51 percent and at its highest level since late 2014. Early 2016 – Inflection Point? Even before Trump's victory, steel stocks seemed to shake off the sluggishness that had plagued them since 2010. Steel stocks heralded 2016 by making a turn for the better, with the government's initiative to penalize dumping of steel by Asian countries proving salubrious for the stocks. The Commerce Department's initiative of imposing import taxes as high as 522 percent on some steel helped the U.S. companies gain a strong foothold on a level playing field. Trump's Victory Cements Stocks Trump's election victory only served to give a second wind to the rally that was already in the works in the steel space. Why is Trump positive for steel stocks? Under Trump, analysts see infrastructure spending getting a big thrust. Ahead of the election, the president-elect promised double of what Hillary Clinton proposed, which put his proposed spending at $550 million. This would mean more steel consumption, driving up the demand side of the equation, which in turn is positive for the top line performances of steel companies. Notwithstanding this, Trump, with his Make America great again slogan is seen to shun anything alien and support anything native to the core. Consequently, analysts see further trade protection accorded to domestic steel companies on top of what was done earlier this year. A sector that was shunned, dumped and deserted has seen patronage increasing this year. Analysts who predicted doom for steel stocks last year are reversing their stance and think now might be the time to buy. Now the next question that begs an answer is whether the steel rally has run its course -- the rally may last through the end of the year, as the year-end Santa Claus rally takes over. The sustenance of the rally depends on the policy moves Trump make and their efficacy. Until then, rise the rally and as the saying goes, enjoy it while it lasts."

2016-12-12,Steel Prices Should Rise Significantly Into First Half Of 2017,"Both U.S. and Euro steel prices will likely rise significantly into the first half of 2017, backed by a raw materials cost-push, seasonally stronger demand and lower imports, Jefferies’ Seth Rosenfeld said in a report. Rosenfeld commented that the steel markets seemed to be hitting “a cyclical sweet spot,” and prices were set to rise into H1 of 2017. The upturn would be driven mainly by: Virgin raw materials inflected in Q3, which supports Chinese and Euro steel prices. U.S. scrap has also recently “followed suit.” Moreover, cost-push steel price inflation seems to have more room to increase. The rise in Asian steel prices have been accompanied by a loss of import competitiveness, “while rising tariffs allow for expanded intra-regional price spreads,” Rosenfeld noted, adding that Trump could fill the emerging policy cracks in the United States, while the EC has launched a critical HDG (Hot-Dip Galvanizing) investigation. In the United States, steel inventories are sub-normal, and moderate in Europe. Thus, with a seasonal improvement in demand into Q1 and structurally growing in infrastructure, restocking is likely. “While 2H17 will see headwinds from growing US capacity and normalising raw materials, steel equities should continue to be supported in coming months by emerging price/vol momentum,” the analyst commented. Downgrades Rosenfeld downgraded the rating on Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) from Buy to Hold, while raising the price target from $20 to $24. He downgraded Worthington Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WOR) from Hold Underperform, and raised the price target from $42 to $45. Despite the upward revision in estimates for U.S.-exposed mills and distributors, there seems to be “limited upside for some equities” and there is risk of near-term pullback in view of the recent sector rally. Although Commercial Metals offers attractive construction exposure, valuation seems stretched and margins could come under pressure. Worthington Industries is trading at peak multiples, and upside is limited by autos appearing poised to plateau and low construction/O&G exposure, the analyst mentioned. Top Picks Rosenfeld cited the following as the top picks in the sector, while maintaining their Buy ratings and raising their price targets: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS): from $7.50 to $13.00. ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE: MT): from €7.25 to €9.50. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE): from $55 to $77. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD): from $32 to $45."
2017-01-12,"Credit Suisse Downgrades Steel Group, Shows Concern With Demand Side Fundamentals","With heightened supply-side concerns in the U.S. Steel Sector, there could be a steep decline in bulk material prices in H2 2017, while infrastructure stimulus is “unlikely to materially benefit US producers,” Credit Suisse’s Curt Woodworth said in a report. He downgraded the steel sector view to Market Weight, saying flat rolled prices could peak in Q1. Rating Changes Woodworth downgraded the rating on United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) from Outperform to Neutral. The price targets are at $30, $36 and $9.50, respectively. Neutral ratings are maintained for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC), with price targets at $56 and $19. The analyst has an Underperform rating on Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF), with a price target of $6. Increased Supply Commenting on the supply side, Woodworth mentioned that Big River, US Steel Granite City and potentially Acero Junction would be ramping capacity by Q2 2017. Steel Dynamics and Novolipetsk Steel would also add to U.S. supply. There would also be higher higher production levels at Bedrock. Demand Side Woes “US steel fundamentals have been supported almost entirely by supply side benefits and cost push inflation in Asia during 2016,” the analyst noted. Despite some positives, US sheet volumes rose merely ~3 percent in 2016, while total US production declined 1 percent year-over-year, despite severe weakness in the back half of 2015. US hot rolled coil apparent consumption has remained negative for the past five months and import penetration has continued to be high relative to historical standards. Also, the MSCI index has remained weak. “We are concerned the Trump boost to equity valuations is overdone, as our analysis suggests limited benefits from infrastructure spending growth and the fact that the heavy lifting on U.S. steel trade policy has been largely finalized following changes to injury laws and successful trade case outcomes in 1H-16,” Woodworth added."
2017-01-18,Steel Expert: Wilbur Ross Comments Give Investors Unfounded Hope,"President-elect Donald Trump proved he can move the market with a word, and on Wednesday, his appointed cabinet member demonstrated a similar power. During his confirmation hearing before Congress, Wilbur Ross, the nominee for U.S. Commerce Secretary, remarked on the steel industry — and saw concurrent shifts in relevant stocks. In two separate comments, Ross identified overcapacity, particularly in China, as the industry’s primary problem, and he said tariffs may be required to stop steel and aluminum dumping. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) shot up 4.1 percent, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) rose 3.3 percent and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) bounced 2.6 percent. But some in the industry claimed the market reactions were unfounded. Experts Assert Trade Tariffs Will Change Little In response to Ross’s comments, Axiom analyst Gordon Johnson told Benzinga that more restrictions on steel trade would have negligible impact on the industry given the many pre-existing restrictions on trade with China. “While there is a strong view that President-Elect Trump’s ‘getting hard on China’ stance will be a huge positive for the steel industry, based on the numbers, we would argue that this was accomplished during Obama’s two-term presidency,” said Johnson. Johnson, who has been negative on steel since early 2016, noted that steel imports from China plunged 63.4 percent over 2016. He expressed surprise that Ross and others in the market are now discussing the issue because it has long been a point of his concern. “We do not believe this dynamic is well understood by the lion’s share of market prognosticators at present,” he wrote. “To wit, unless more tariffs on Chinese imports are going to drive them into negative territory (at risk of stating the obvious, this is impossible), we see the market’s reaction today as misplaced.”"

2017-01-19,"Citi Steals The Thunder From Steel, Downgrades Sector","Citi in a note released on Thursday downgraded the U.S. steel sector to Neutral from Bullish, as it believes the 68 percent rally in the sector since mid-October captures the majority of the cyclical upside. The firm downgraded steel stocks AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X). Steel Prices To Decline In 2H07; Citi Not Outrightly Bearish Analyst Alexander Hacking noted implied EBITDA per tons are close to peak 2007–08 levels in AK Steel and U.S. Steel. The analyst expects steel prices to decline in the second half of 2017 based on increased domestic supply, limited demand growth, lower raw materials and import parity. That said, the firm said it would not turn outright bearish due to potential structural positives such as Chinese supply side reform and U.S. government policy, having the potential to generate further upside. Raising Price Forecast Citi raised its 2017 average hot rolled coil steel price forecast to $567 per ton from $514 per ton. Nevertheless, the firm said it is cautious about buying into the last price increase, with $100 per ton downside in prices expected in the second half. Citi also noted that the import arbitrage with Turkey and Black Sea exports is now at over $150 per ton. Demand To Rise Modestly The firm expects U.S. steel demand to rise 3.5 percent in 2017, with current capacity, plus, new supply from Big River sufficient to absorb the demand, even with structurally low imports. Policy Support May Be Long Time Coming Citi sees support from new policies on trade, taxes and infrastructure. Given that details on policies are short, the firm said it is hesitant to overpay without more clarity. According to Citi, incremental demand from infrastructure would be 6 mtpy, although it is not expected at least until 2018. Ratings/Price Targets AK Steel: Downgraded to Sell from Neutral/price target raised to $8 from $5. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC): Downgraded to Neutral from Buy/price target raised to $21 from $20. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE): Maintains at Neutral/price target raised to $65 from $50.

2017-02-16,Who's The Boss? It Could Be This New ETF,"The universe of niche exchange traded funds includes various products aimed at delivering exposure to stocks insiders are buying or those names that frequently appear in the 13F filings of widely followed investors. Add the Global X Founder-Run Companies ETF (BATS: BOSS) to the list of unique approaches to the equity market. The Global X Founder-Run Companies ETF, which debuted Wednesday, follows the Solactive U.S. Founder-Run Companies Index. BOSS focuses primarily on U.S. large- and mid-cap companies where the chief executive officer is also a founder. “Founders tend to have significant personal wealth tied to the companies they lead, and thus often focus on long-term value creation through innovation and entrepreneurialism,” according to Global X. Data suggest investors can be rewarded by founder-run companies. “For example, the average annual compensation for founder/CEOs is 32% less than that of the average S&P 500 CEO, as founders understand that maximizing their salary could come at the expense of deploying cash to fund long term growth opportunities, and thus hurt their equity value over the long term. In addition, these CEOs are careful to not take on excessive debt, as bankruptcy would wipe out the value of their equity stake. As a result, founder-run companies exhibit 52% lower debt-to-equity ratios than the S&P 500 as a whole,” according to Global X. BOSS allocates nearly 26 percent of its weight to technology stocks while the healthcare sector chimes in at 20.7 percent. The new ETF's top 10 holdings include some familiar names such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). BOSS charges 0.65 percent a year, or $65 on a $10,000 stake. Image: Who's The Boss? Season 2 Credits, Sony Pictures"

2017-04-20,Steel Companies Applaud Trump's Trade Practices Investigation,"Steel stocks surged higher than 8 percent Thursday after President Donald Trump launched an investigation into whether foreign steel imports hurt national security. Trump And Commerce Citing global concern distinct from any particular national agent, Trump ordered the U.S. Commerce Department to prioritize the inquiry. The president signed the memorandum under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which empowers him to restrict imports on national security concerns. The leading question is the correlation between unfair trade practices and compromised security measures, particularly the extent to which the former undermines the latter. Seeing Movement In Steel AK Steel particularly feels the ongoing impact of unfair electrical steel imports flooding our market, AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) CEO Roger Newport said in a press release. We cannot allow our nation's electrical grid, which is a critical part of the nation's infrastructure and vital to America's national security interests, to be dependent on foreign electrical steel, particularly in the event of a natural disaster or other crisis.” Newport added that the president’s actions will bolster the competitiveness of American steel makers and preserve domestic jobs. For too long, China and other nations have been conducting economic warfare against the American steel industry by subsidizing their steel industries, distorting global markets, and dumping excess steel into the United States, United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) wrote in a press release. The effects have been staggering. Tens of thousands of workers in the American steel industry, the industry's supply chain and the communities in which our industry operates have lost their jobs due to unfair and illegal practices by foreign producers. We have offered the Commerce Department our full cooperation during its investigation. U.S. Steel was trading up 8.1 percent, AK Steel 4.5 percent, Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE:CLF) 7.7 percent and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) 5.4 percent at the time of publication.

2017-05-23,Steel Stocks Outperform Ahead Of Wednesday's Commerce Department Hearing,"Steel stocks were up big on Tuesday ahead of the Department of Commerce hearing on the Section 232 probe. The DoC is set to come out with more details regarding the impact steel imports has on U.S. national security. Stock Movements United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X): Up 5.27 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS): Up 9.55 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Up 3.54 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD): Up 4.08 percent. Worthington Industries, Inc. (NYSE:WOR): Up 3.29 percent. A Jefferies research analyst suggested a high probability of the DoC institutes more incremental trade defense measures but noted most of the investigation remains unknown going into Wednesday. The report noted investors should expect “to garner a better understanding of the true breadth of the investigation with presenters likely to include domestic-international mills, industry groups, in addition to consumers/processors.” Ultimately, trade lawyers believe the hearing will offer steelmakers an opportunity to share what regulations they would like to see. Lawyers believe the final measures from this probe could involve tariffs, volume restrictions, quotas or license fees. The current administration is looking for a win, and signs are currently leaning towards a positive outcome according to the Jeffries report. Here’s what investors know so far: The DoC is taking a holistic view of “national security” This means they are looking at production/capacity, employment loss, displacement of domestic products by imports, etc. Secretary Wilbur Ross had indicated he is aiming for broad measures He has criticized antidumping/countervailing measures by calling them “porous” and stating that the measures could have more potential Section 232 is viewed as a probe that is meant to help steelmakers while also not permanently impacting other trade methods according to the Jefferies report How Has The Probe Impacted Buyer Behavior? Many participants expect the Trump administration to enact broader measures and have adjusted their buying patterns. Some foreign mills have already told “domestic buyers” they would be forced to pay the potential tariffs which has led to some cancellations. The DoC has 270 days to complete its investigation, but Ross has noted that the investigation could be finished by the middle of June. The hearing begins at 10:00 a.m. ET tomorrow.

However, it's difficult to determine what impact this will have on steel equities, Hacking said. Steel equities have lost value since President Donald Trump’s win in November, but this meeting potentially could provide them with an upside. Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, told the NASDAQ, The probe could result in broader protections that solve a whack-a-mole problem of shutting out unfairly traded imports from China or India only to see shipments increase from elsewhere or transshipped through third countries.” The hearing will be live-streamed starting at 10 a.m., according to the DOC website."
2017-05-24,"Steel Analyst Says The Market's Become Too Bearish On China, Upgrades Entire Sector","Credit Suisse analyst Curt Woodworth upgraded the U.S. steel sector from Market Weight to Overweight, citing an overly bearish view of Chinese hot rolled coil and the pending results of the Department of Commerce’s investigation into the industry. The analyst also upgraded United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) from Neutral to Outperform. A Look At Chinese Steel The analyst reiterated his forecast that hot rolled coil (HRC) will bottom out this summer at $580 per ton, noting that Chinese HRC prices are reverting to normalized levels, but now expects prices to recover in Q3. Rebar prices are also at multi-year highs. This data along with solid demand lead Woodworth to believe “the market has become too bearish on China.” See Also: Section 232 Public Hearing Wednesday Is 'Unlikely To Affect Steel Equities' Section 232 The Department of Commerce has been looking into the effects of steel imports on national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. “We believe the DoC will find some interrelationship between the health of the US steel industry and US national security, paving the way for [President Donald] Trump to implement additional layers of trade support for the industry,” said Woodworth. The analyst believes the market is underestimating changes in foreign producer behavior for five reasons: Presidential executive orders in support of steel. Trump’s proactive “steel triumvirate” of Wilbur Ross, Peter Navarro and Robert Lighthizer. The Department of Commerce’s Section 232 investigation. The Department of Commerce’s late invocation of the Particular Market Situation rule in the Korea oil country tubular goods (OCTG) ruling. Trump's mission to more aggressively enforce trade laws. Company Highlights Credit Suisse raised its price target for United States Steel to $29, and sees a pathway to approximately $1.3 billion of EBITDA by 2018 driven by oil country tubular goods. Steel Dynamics’ price target was upped $7 to $43 and the company is forecasted to see strong volume growth in the coming years as well as potential mergers and acquisitions. The analyst’s price target for Nucor was raised to $68, stating that the two main concerns — weak fundamentals in long products and excess HRC exposure — are fading."

2017-05-31,Nucor: The Best Shining U.S. Steel Stock,"Recent History of Steel Stocks The U.S. steel industry has been in a downtrend since the 2008 global recession due, in large part, to China's dumping of cheap steal into the market. The chart below illustrates just how much the imbalance of China's imports and exports of steel has widened since 2009. Source: Steel Industry Executive Summary: May 2017 This supply and demand imbalance has pushed steel prices lower which has weighed heavily on producers such as U.S. Steel Corp (NYSE:X), Nucor (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD). However, sentiment for this sluggish industry changed following the election of President Donald Trump and his “America First” focus. What Makes Steel Stocks Shine Now? Just last month, President Trump ordered a probe of foreign steel’s impact on U.S. security. The potential outcomes of this Section 232 investigation could be additional tariffs and (or) limiting imports of foreign made steel. This could help inflate U.S. steel prices which would ultimately help U.S. steel manufactures. Global demand also appears to be on the uptrend. The World Steel Association reported in April that the global steel capacity utilization is up by 26%, its highest level in nearly two and half years. More recently on May 24th, Credit Suisse upgraded the entire steel sector highlighting that its channel checks with U.S. traders and OEMs indicate that a structural change is taking place with respect to U.S. trade… which the market is underestimating. Tailwinds appear to be building in the U.S. steel market. Why Nucor? Nucor Corporation is an American steel and related products producer. It is the largest steel producer in the U.S. and also the largest minimill steelmaker. The use of minimills in steel manufacturing rather than traditional methods of melting the scrap steel adds more value to Nucor when compared with traditional manufacturers such as U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel (NYSE:AKS). Minimills are already experiencing a comeback and have been a bright spot in the industry. Bradford Research recently highlighted that profits for minimills are up 50% to 100% compared to this time a year ago. In addition, Nucor is a well diversified and well positioned U.S. steel company. Over the last several years, the company focused on expanding its business in new areas such as Canada and Mexico to help combat geographic specific downturns. These precautionary actions should pave the way for tremendous growth going forward in addition to any potential comeback in the U.S. steel market. The company's 2016 EBITDA and EBITDA margin of $2,116 and 13.1%, respectively, reached a level not seen since 2008. Furthermore, the company's unique profit sharing price structure helped Nucor stay profitable though the steel industry's downturn as shown below. Nucor summary financials source. Nucor’s profit and returns are also well above its industry peers and the materials sector as a whole as illustrated below. Peers include: X, CMC, AKS, WOR, RS, AP and HNH. Nucor peer chart source. Nucor's Quality Margin Of Safety Nucor shares also look attractive on a fundamental cash flow basis. When applying Wall Street projections to eleven separate valuation analyses, finbox.io calculates an intrinsic value estimate of $62.75 that implies 8% upside. View all 11 valuation models that derive NUE's fair value estimate. Nucor is a diversified, high-quality business with a consistent track record and looks to be trading at a discount. A potential increase in global demand coupled with President Trump's trillion dollar investment plan and section 232 investigation provide additional upside for Nucor shareholders. Value investors may want to take a closer look at this shining steel stock."

2017-06-20,Steel Dynamics (STLD) Provides Earnings Guidance for Q2,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD has provided guidance for the second quarter of 2017. The company expects earnings for the quarter in the band of 60 cents to 64 cents per share. This is a marked decrease from 82 cents per share recorded in the previous quarter, but an increase from 58 cents a share it earned a year ago.During the second quarter of 2017, Steel Dynamics modernized one of its galvanizing lines at the Butler Flat Roll Division and also expanded the annual value-added production capacity by additional 180,000 tons for roughly $15 million.Additionally, the company faced some issues related to the start-up of its new Galvalume and paint line at the Columbus Flat Roll Division. This resulted in increased costs and lesser value-added shipments, which the company expects to reduce pre-tax earnings by $15 million during the second quarter. However, the company said that the underlying issues have been distinctly identified and are being resolved.Steel Dynamics mentioned that its profitability from steel operations is estimated to decline in the second quarter on sequential basis because of higher average scrap costs and lower overall shipments. The average steel product pricing is also anticipated to rise in the second quarter but higher scrap costs could offset the improvement in sales price.The company also noted that about 40% of its flat roll volume is linked to indexed contracts that usually lag spot prices by one to two months. The remaining volume is spot price based, which is presently lower compared with the previous quarter.Steel Dynamics expects demand from automotive and construction sectors to remain strong. It expects the energy sector to strengthen, moving ahead. The profitability of metals recycling platform is anticipated to remain steady on sequential basis owing to higher average sales price offsetting lower shipments in some certain southeastern locations.The company's fabricated steel joist and deck products business is also expected to benefit from strong demand as non-residential construction market has been showing signs of improvement of late. This is anticipated to offset metal spread compression related to higher average steel input costs.Steel Dynamics' shares fell 3.2% in the last three months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Steel-Producers industry's decline of 15.3%. Steel Dynamics, in its first quarter earnings call, announced that it expects the demand from North American automotive steel market to remain steady. The company also anticipates growth in construction sector, which should benefit from large public sector infrastructure projects. The energy sector has also begun to strengthen. The company also achieved successful product and market diversification at its Columbus Flat Roll Division. The division is expected to benefit from numerous end markets and potential customers. The company has also completed the construction of a $100 million paint line facility in the fourth quarter of 2016, adding 250,000 tons of value-added painting capacity.The company is well-poised for growth as it remains focused on delivering shareholder value through strategic and organic growth opportunities.Steel Dynamics, Inc.

2017-06-23,"Catalysts On The Horizon For Metals & Mining Group; Deutsche Bank Upgrades, US Steel, AK Steel To Buy","After a rough start to 2017, steel investors may have a better go of it in the second half of the year. Deutsche Bank analyst Jorge Beristain has upgraded a handful of steel and aluminum stocks and is now constructive on steel prices following a sluggish second quarter. U.S. hot-rolled coil prices declined 9 percent in the second quarter, potentially masking a 4-percent year-to-date uptick in apparent steel demand based on increasing U.S. economic activity. In addition to rising demand, supportive trade policy could also serve as a positive catalyst for steel prices, Beristain said. “We believe underlying demand will recover and imports subside once Section 232 is formerly released (end-June last timeline) and signed into law by President Trump soon after (between 0 and 105 days),” Beristain wrote. Related Link: A Long-Time US Steel Bear Is Impressed With New CEO, But Not With Stock Deutsche Bank has cut its 2017 HRC steel price forecast by 2 percent to $620/ston but maintains its 2018 forecast of $600/ston. The firm also cut its 2017 forecasts for nickel by 7 percent to $9,832/t and is calling for iron ore prices to remain around $50/t. Now that Deutsche Bank sees steel prices stabilizing, the firm has upgraded several steel and aluminum stocks: Upgraded United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) from Hold to Buy. Upgraded AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) from Hold to Buy. Upgraded Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ:CENX) from Sell to Hold and raised price target from $10 to $15. Raised price target for Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) from $37 to $44. In addition to the upgrades, Beristain reiterated his top four Buy-rated stock picks in the space to be Arconic Inc (NYSE:ARNC), Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (NASDAQ:KALU), Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). At Time Of Publication United States Steel shares were up 4.63 percent at $22.05. AK Steel was up 4.68 percent at $6.59. Century Aluminum was up 5.12 percent at $14.57. Alcoa shares were up 2.11 percent at $30.43. Kaiser shares were up 0.69 percent at $85.08. Reliance Steel & Aluminum shares were up 0.41 percent at $71.26. Steel Dynamics was up 1.13 percent at $33.89. Arconic shares were relatively flat, down 0.04 percent at $25.29."

2017-07-11,"Citi Previews Steel Sector Earnings, Says US Steel May Outperform","With second-quarter North American steel earnings just around the corner, Citigroup analyst Alexander Hacking recently provided investors with a brief preview of what they should expect. While Citi isn’t anticipating industry-wide strength for steel stocks, Hacking said United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) could be a standout performer. U.S. Steel’s first-quarter results were weighed down by seasonable weakness and one-time charges that should have no impact on its Q2 results. U.S. Steel will also likely provide more details about its ongoing asset revitalization initiative, which Hacking said could be a positive for the stock. But while U.S. Steel could be on the upswing after it reports, Citi expects AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) earnings to decline in Q2, as higher maintenance and raw materials costs will weigh on the company’s bottom line. Iron ore and coking coal prices could also offset positive demand impacts for Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Hacking wrote. He said risk/reward is currently balanced for both stocks. A wildcard in the steel industry at the moment is President Donald Trump’s Section 232 investigation into steel and aluminum imports. However, Hacking cautioned investors about making assumptions about the impact of the investigation. “Section 232 could generate upside, but we are cautious about overpaying for this trade, which may have limited duration,” he wrote. Related Link: Catalysts On The Horizon For Metals & Mining Group; Deutsche Bank Upgrades, US Steel, AK Steel To Buy In June, Deutsche Bank upgraded U.S. Steel and AK Steel to Buy on expectations that Section 232 will help underlying U.S. steel demand and potentially limit imports.

2017-07-18,Morgan Stanley: Now Is The Time To Forge A Position In US Steel Names,"Wall Street got even more bullish on steel stocks on Tuesday when Morgan Stanley analyst Evan Kurtz recommended traders take the opportunity to buy a handful a steel stocks ahead of earnings season. Kurtz’s bullish note came after Morgan Stanley analysts met with steel and scrap buyers, traders and processors last week to discuss the outlook for the industry. According to Kurtz, U.S. steel prices will likely be on the rise in the second half of the year. “The key takeaways were that imports are likely to dip significantly in September/October since traders don’t want to take the risk of being an ‘importer of record’ with the threat of Section 232 penalties,” Kurtz wrote. Related Link: Citi Previews Steel Sector Earnings, Says US Steel May Outperform President Trump has ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, the groundwork for him potentially using his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. In light of the potential upcoming catalyst for domestic steel, Morgan Stanley has raised its forecast for hot rolled steel by about $55/st to around $625/st. Looking ahead to earnings season, Kurtz expects traders will be watching United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) closest since they haven’t provided updated Q2 guidance recently. For U.S. Steel, the critical issue will be whether or not Q1 headwinds carried over into the second quarter. For AK Steel, investors will be watching to see whether or not the company’s second have auto forecasts are adjusted to account for end-market weakness. Headed into earnings season, Morgan Stanley has Overweight ratings on the following metals & mining stocks: Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) Goldcorp Inc. (USA) (NYSE:GG) Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) U.S Steel"

2017-07-26,"Gordon Johnson: Delay Of Sec. 232 Trumps US Steel's Unexpected Earnings Beat, Justifies Sector Weakness","In spite of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X)'s positive earnings report Tuesday, the markets saw unusual weakness across the industry Wednesday, from AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) to Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). Gordon Johnson, managing director of Axiom Capital Management, attributed the phenomenon to President Donald Trump’s Tuesday announcement delaying the imposition of steel import tariffs. “The Section 232 was everything,” Johnson told Benzinga in an email, noting that all of his clients had been long steel because of it. “I don’t care what people tell you, the thought was it was going to get passed at yesterday’s Trump rally in Youngstown, OH.” But, as he had previously warned, it didn’t pass. “I can't believe folks were so nice on USS' call,” he added. “This is a disaster of an announcement for the steel mills by Trump.” Considering flat-to-weak demand, high output and the fact that “auto sucks,” he expects steel prices to continue lower. What The Steel Players Say Johnson believed U.S. steel mills had been pumping steel prices on the prospect of the 232’s passage. Following the announced delay, he consulted multiple industry players on the implications. The overall sentiment was the market could soften following the news. One industry source highlighted a market participant who resumed purchasing of Korean hot rolled coil recently. The source pointed out to Johnson the fact that traders are still using 232 clauses and that the fear factor is gone.

2017-07-27,"Trump Comments On Trade Caused This Analyst To Downgrade AK Steel, US Steel","United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) shares jumped 7.2 percent on Wednesday after the company’s second-quarter earnings topped Wall Street’s expectations. However, comments from President Donald Trump about his ongoing investigation into U.S. steel imports this week may have taken the wind out of U.S. Steel’s sails, according to Longbow Research analyst Chris Olin. On Thursday, Olin downgraded U.S. Steel and rival AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) from Buy to Neutral after Trump said potential restrictions on U.S. steel imports under his Section 232 authority would be put on the backburner for now while Republicans focus on higher-priority issues such as healthcare and tax reform. Olin now sees only a 50 percent probability of a positive outcome from Trump’s investigation, down from a 70 percent chance just a month ago. “The uncertainty on the Trump Administration steel import policy was reflected in modestly slower steel activity,” Olin wrote. “Over the past few days, industry contacts suggested the channel returned to ‘business as usual,’ with customer orders and price expectations turning flattish.” Related Link: What Moves US Steel Shares More, Earnings Or Trump Talk On Trade? With U.S. Steel already up 19 percent in the past month, Olin sees little room for upside unless Trump can provide a meaningful boost to domestic steel prices. In the meantime, Longbow suggests investors focus on mini-mill names, such as Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). Olin likes these two companies’ exposure to nonresidential construction, lower HRC cost structures, relative insulation from the auto industry and their strong balance sheets. Longbow maintains Buy ratings on both stocks with a $66 price target for Nucor and a $40 price target for Steel Dynamics. ______ Image Credit: By Jim Mattis - 170720-D-SV709-006, Public Domain, via Wikimedia Commons"
2017-09-05,"Predicting A Price Surge, Bank Of America Upgrades U.S. Steel","U.S. steel stocks have lagged the market so far in 2017, but the groundwork may be set for a strong finish to 2017. On Tuesday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners upgraded United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) to Buy and said steel prices are headed higher in the second half of the year. According to Tanners, reduction in Chinese production coupled with elevated demand will offset any pricing pressures that result from a disappointing resolution to the Section 232 investigation in the United States. After opening the investigation into steel imports earlier this year, President Trump recently said that a final decision on potential restrictions is not a priority for the administration at the moment. “We’re waiting till we get everything finished up between health care and taxes and maybe even infrastructure,” Trump said in July. Related Link: Morgan Stanley: Now Is The Time To Forge A Position In US Steel Names Tanners said some degree of trade protection should be possible for U.S. steel producers, even if it’s not as much as investors had initially hoped. Hurricane Harvey rebuilding could also provide a bit of a demand boost in the U.S., but Tanners said hurricanes have historically not moved the needle much. Bank of America has raised its year-end price forecast for hot rolled coil steel by about 5 percent to $700/st. “We think a rising steel price is not fully anticipated by steel buyers, with many holding off purchases, or investors, with the group underowned and still recovering from its wounds after Section 232 so far has disappointed,” Tanners wrote. In addition to the new Buy rating and $31 price target for U.S. Steel, Bank of America has Buy ratings on the following domestic steel stocks as well: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) ($9 price target) Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) ($73 price target) Steel Dynamics, Inc.

2017-09-15,Did Hurricanes Bend Steel Stocks' Strength This September?,"U.S. steel investors will be watching closely next week as two bellwethers for the domestic steel business are expected to release Q3 guidance. Jefferies analyst Seth Rosenfeld says Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) will likely disappoint Wall Street by guiding for Q3 EPS of around 80 cents, while Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) will come closer to consensus estimates by guiding for EPS of 65 cents. Update: On Friday morning, Nucor said it sees Q3 GAAP of 75 cents-80 cents, which doesn't compare to $1.02 estimates. Prior to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the U.S. steel industry was demonstrating surprising seasonal strength in the third quarter. Through early September, weekly U.S. production was up 4 percent year-over-year and up 1 percent compared to Q2. However, Rosenfeld says Harvey and Irma likely had a negative impact on the Q3 production and shipments of Nucor, Steel Dynamics and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC), all of which operate in the South. “Both NUE/STLD 3Q17 guidance expected next week may come below sell-side expectations, but likely match already cautious buy-side, with downside risks from recent hurricanes unknown,” Rosenfeld wrote. Despite headwinds from the hurricanes, the potential for an expanding metal spread into Q4 makes any guidance-related sell-off a buying opportunity next week. Jefferies anticipates United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) to maintain its previous full-year 2017 EBITDA guidance of $1.1 billion. Jefferies estimates Q3 U.S. HRC prices to average $626/ton, up $10 from Q2. Iron ore prices are also expected to jump $10 to $73/ton. HRC spreads are expected to decrease by $6 per ton to $262.

2017-10-02,Analyst Surveys Suggest Steel Stocks Will Soon Suffer,"Recent analyst surveys brought to light the brittle nature of steel stocks, leading Longbow Research to downgrade Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). Meanwhile, the firm maintained its ratings on AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Rating/Price Target Nucor: Downgraded to Neutral/Price target lowered from $62 to $56–$58. Steel Dynamics: Downgraded to Neutral/PT lowered from $40 to $35–$36. AK Steel: Maintained at Neutral. United States Steel: Maintained at Neutral. In Pre-Market Trading Monday Nucor was slipping 1.28 percent to $55.32. Steel Dynamics shares were losing 1.91 percent to $33.81. AKS Steel was adding 0.18 percent to $5.59. United States Steel was off 0.23 percent to $25.60. Demand, Pricing Weakness Analyst Chris Olin said he is cutting his fourth-quarter and 2018 earnings per share estimates for the entire steel coverage group, attributing the action to the incremental demand weakness evident in its latest carbon steel channel checks. The analyst noted that order activity slowed notably since the summer months, and industry contacts recently lowered the near-term pricing expectations on Hot Rolled Coil despite limited import availability. Accordingly, the firm noted that the year-end pricing forecast for HRC is down at $580–$590 per ton after holding in the $640 range for most of the summer months. See also: Did Hurricanes Bend Steel Stocks' Strength This September? Dissecting The Demand Weakness Giving anecdotes of demand weakness, Longbow Research said downstream volume growth fell 1–2 percent year over year, a reversal from the 2–3-percent positive comps performance in the second quarter. Additionally, the firm said 11 of the 15 individually-tracked end-markets are showing unfavorable comps versus the last quarter. The firm also noted that service inventories are balanced on the long product side but sheet distributors are aiming to cut holdings. Finally, the firm said speculation that hedge-buying created 2 million–3 million tons of excess invisible inventory is abounding, with about 20 percent of companies saying third-quarter volumes were coming in below plan. Supply-Side Dynamics On the supply-side, the firm noted there are very few lower prices imports, with 65 percent of sheet buyers seeing a pullback in foreign availability. The surveys also showed that 45 percent of contacts are sourcing imports, down from the normal 60-70 percent acceptance rate, the firm said. Also, the firm projects import market share loss over the next three to four months. Pricing Longbow Research noted that distributors have started to cut the near-term spot price expectations, which is down $40–$50 per ton from the estimate in late summer. The firm expects the excess scrap supply to pressure raw material prices in October/November. While noting that the past mill price increase attempts did not stick, the firm said the current quote for HRC is $610–$620 per ton, down $10–$20 per ton from the August level. Quoting the survey, the firm said, I think most people have gotten over their fears of supply drying up and that is why pricing has started to fall. All of the distributors we talk to really have no major concerns about the looming 232. Demand has definitely slowed. Fully Neutral The firm said it is now Fully Neutral on its steel coverage group, with 2017 and 2018 estimates at or below consensus estimates. The firm noted that downstream steel volumes are coming in below plan and most distributors are looking to liquidate inventories. While there has been investor speculation about potential benefits [associated] with cutbacks in global supply (and focus on Chinese reform), this impact is not evident within channel check data or distributor sentiment, the firm said.

2017-10-18,Gordon Johnson Calls ArcelorMittal Out On Steel Price 'Manipulation',"When it comes to steel, traders know product price movement correlates with stock price movement. Steel mills know it, too. According to Axiom’s Gordon Johnson, this understanding drove ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE:MT) to announce a $40- to $50-ton price increase. “These guys announce price hikes when there’s either real demand or things are very weak and they’re trying to stop prices from falling further,” Johnson told Benzinga. “I think in this case it’s the latter.” The timing is certainly suspect. By Johnson’s analysis, demand is weak, iron ore is down, scrap is down and falling, and inventories are high based on winter demand. A price surge “doesn’t make sense.” “I don’t see how these guys haven’t been accused of price manipulation,” he said. Industry To Follow? But the poor state of demand won’t deter competitors from following suit. Johnson said the ArcelorMittal announcement will prompt similar hikes at United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF). The mere expectation for peers to imitate ArcelorMittal's price increases inspired a pop across industry stocks, Johnson said. But the spike will only last as long as investors assume strong demand, which Johnson said doesn't exist. He expects a cursory investigation into demand to diminish the market's support of steel. “This [announcement] will maybe delay the price decline by a week, but if there is no demand, prices will continue falling,” he said. “We believe demand is weak.” The analyst expects “bad” earnings reports — although not necessarily misses — from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Cliffs this week, which could reverse Wednesday’s trends.

2017-10-19,Steel Dynamics: The Steel Sector Pace Car For Q3 Earnings,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reported in-line earnings Wednesday, but Axiom’s Gordon Johnson expects a Thursday sell-off on weak guidance. Management announced fourth-quarter outlook for earnings before interest and taxes below Street expectations and cited “maintenance” for the anticipated miss (see Johnson's track record here). Johnson interpreted waning confidence as confirmation of lacking steel demand. “Why take maintenance if demand is robust?” he told Benzinga. This assessment — coupled with drops in iron ore and steel prices, high seasonal inventory, declines in U.S. construction spending and cuts to auto production — reinforced his negative industry sentiment. In a Thursday note, Johnson lowered Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) estimates ahead of Friday earnings and predicted a miss and cut to full-year guidance. He expects third-quarter revenue of $632 million and earnings per share of 24 cents against Street expectations of $676 million and 32 cents. The steel industry will wrap up its reports with: Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) on Oct. 19. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) on Oct. 26. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) on Oct. 31. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) on Oct. 31. ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE:MT) on Nov. 11. Heading into the season, the Street appears ambivalent on industry players, with TipRanks reporting a general balance of ratings. As of Thursday, analysts had three Buys, three Holds and two Sells on Cliffs.

2017-10-20,"Earnings Catalysts, M&A Opportunities Earn Steel Dynamics An Upgrade","Earnings and M&A catalysts have added sheen to Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) shares. Citing these two catalysts, KeyBanc Capital Markets upgraded shares of Steel Dynamics and raised its earnings per share estimates for the company. As such, the firm upgraded shares of Steel Dynamics from Sector Weight to Overweight with a $44 price target. After adding 3.68 percent to $37.78 on Thursday, Steel Dynamics was up an incremental 1.96 percent at $38.52 in pre-market trading. Analysts Philip Gibbs and Tyler Kenyon said they are raising their earnings per share estimates for the period from 2017 to 2018, attributing the revision to better third-quarter cost performance, better appreciation of timing/magnitude of organic growth initiatives and completed share repurchase activity. The analysts raised their 2018 earnings per share estimate from $2.35 to $2.70. The analysts believe execution and organic growth levers are now enough to more than offset steel-marking consumable cost increases. Gibbs and Kenyon expect fuller realization of long products internal growth initiatives to add another 15 to 25 cents per share. See also: Analyst Surveys Suggest Steel Stocks Will Soon Suffer KeyBanc Capital Markets said it thinks the time is ripe for some meaningful, perhaps transformational M&A, with forward net debt-to-EBITDA, financed partly with cash and partly with debt. This, according to the firm, will lead to over 35 cents in earnings per share accretion. All else equal, the firm said M&A prospects give an aspirational 2019 earnings per share power of $3.25 to $3.50, supporting a share price near $50. On valuation, the firm said the shares appear reasonably valued at current levels, on a relative basis. The firm noted that the stock now trades at a discount to the carbon steel sector despite an industry-leading return on invested capital. The firm also said the U.S. sheet pricing recovery supports more constructive sector sentiment. At time of publication, shares of Steel Dynamics were up 2.12 percent at $38.58 in Friday's pre-market session."
2017-10-31,6 Stocks Dragged Down By AK Steel's Disappointing Q3 Report,"Shares of AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) fell more than 12 percent Tuesday morning after the company's third-quarter earnings report came in short of expectations. AK Steel reported a GAAP earnings per share loss of 2 cents on revenue of $1.49 billion. Wall Street analysts were expecting the company to earn 4 cents per share on revenue of $1.52 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter fell from $156.6 million, or 10.8 percent of net sales, a year ago to $69.2 million, or 4.6 percent of net sales. Total flat-rolled steel shipments fell 2 percent from a year ago to 1.3686 million tons due to softer demand from the automotive market, the company said. Average selling price per flat-rolled steel ton did rise 2 percent from a year ago to $1,021 due to the higher average selling price on contract and spot market sales and higher surcharges on specialty steels. Our financial results for the third quarter are in line with the guidance we provided in July. We are particularly pleased to have completed the acquisition of Precision Partners during the quarter as we execute on our downstream strategy, said Roger K. Newport, CEO of AK Steel. Our ongoing efforts to strengthen our balance sheet continued during the quarter with the successful refinancing of our 2022 senior notes and extension of our credit facility. These actions position us well for the future. Steel Stocks Lower AK Steel's poor earnings report was felt across nearly the entire steel and commodity sector although to various degrees. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X): down 4.99 percent at $25.12. Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST): down 2.91 percent at $14.37. Gerdau SA (ADR) (NYSE:GGB): down 1.63 percent at $3.32.

2017-11-24,KeyBanc On Steel Stocks: Take Profits In Your Outsized Gains,"Offering its take on the steel sector — comprising carbon-sheet mills, carbon sheet distributors and raw material suppliers — KeyBanc Capital Markets said in a Monday note it maintains its selective view on carbon sector equities. U.S. sheet supply-demand momentum appears more balanced into 2018, supporting improvements in pricing and demand into the first quarter of 2018, said analyst Philip Gibbs. See also: Analyst Surveys Suggest Steel Stocks Will Soon Suffer Steel Dynamics' Discounted Valuation Liked Among the individual stocks, Gibbs said he likes Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD)'s relative sector discount on 2018 expectations. The discount comes despite the company's industry-leading return on invested capital, or ROIC, and organic and inorganic catalysts, the analyst said. (See Gibbs' track record here.) Reliance Steel Sparkles On Execution Additionally, Gibbs said he likes Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS)'s strong third-quarter execution. KeyBanc raised its forward estimates for the company. Neutral On Ryerson Holding> The firm downgraded shares of Ryerson Holding Corp (NYSE:RYI) from Overweight to Sector Weight, with the action blamed on its downgraded view of competitive FIFO gross margin environment in the distributor segment for 2018. The firm also sees operating margin pressure and lower-than-expected FCFE generation. The firm reduced its estimates for Ryerson Holding, Olympic Steel, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZEUS) and Worthington Industries, Inc. (NYSE:WOR).

2018-01-11,KeyBanc Issues Stronger Forecast For 3 Steel Names,"The steel sector is looking more attractive than in the past, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The Analyst KeyBanc's Philip Gibbs: Upgraded Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST)'s from Underweight to Sector Weight with no assigned price target, but a $16 fair value price. Maintains an Overweight rating on Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) with a price target boosted from $84 to $95. Maintains an Overweight rating on Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD)'s stock with a price target boosted form $44 to $49. The Thesis U.S. steel demand in 2017 was forecast to have initially grown by 2 percent, but a more accurate figure is 5 percent, Gibbs said in an industrywide research report. (See the analyst's track record here.) Growth came from stronger energy and industrial demand and some implied restocking, Gibbs said. Toward the end of 2017, fourth-quarter shipments were likely stronger than distributors expected, while December shipments were much better than normal seasonality, he said. Given the strong momentum, KeyBanc lifted his 2018 HRC pricing estimate from $615/ton to $655/ton (versus 2017's $623/ton) with strength coming from the energy and industrial sectors, plus alignment in auto inventories, the analyst said. Related Link: This Big US Steel Bear Admits Opportunity For Near-Term Upside TimkenSteel's Upgrade SBQ, or special bar quality, steel represents around 60-65 percent of TimkenSteel's consolidated business and up to 80 percent of its value-added business, Gibbs said. Expectations for 2018 are that the annual SBQ contract price resets will boost the company's FIFO EBITDA from a prior estimate of $93 million to $117 million, he said. TimkenSteel will also see less impact year-over-year from a raw material spread hit and improvements in energy shipments with further upside to the company's annually priced billet arrangement, Gibbs said. Reliance Steel & Aluminum's New Demand Baseline Gibbs turned incrementally bullish on Reliance Steel & Aluminum due to higher than previously expected volumes in the fourth quarter, which he said creates a new demand baseline for 2018. The company will benefit from higher carbon and aluminum pricing expectations and an 80-cents-per-share benefit from tax reform. Incrementally Bullish On Steel Dynamics Gibbs' 2018 earnings per share estimate for Steel Dynamics moved higher from $2.67 to $3.50 due to higher sheet volumes and spreads along with stronger beam spreads, he said. The analyst's revision doesn't assume normalization in CRC-to-HRC spreads. At around $46 per share, Steel Dynamics' stock trades at an 8x EV/EBITDA valuation on 2018 estimates, in the middle of the stock's historic normalized range of 6x to 9x, the analyst said. A $49 price target implies an 8.5x multiple, which is justified given the company's industry growth momentum and strong recurring FCFE yield of around 8 percent, he said.

2018-02-12,KeyBanc Projects 17% Upside In Timkensteel Corp. Shares,"Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST) shares have pulled back about 26 percent since their Jan. 23 high, in contrast to a more modest 8-percent drop by the S&P 500 Index, prompting KeyBanc Capital Markets to upgrade the stock. The Analyst Analyst Philip Gibbs upgraded shares of Timkensteel from Sector Weight from Overweight with a $17 price target, suggesting about 17-percent upside from current levels. The Thesis An attractive valuation after the recent sell-off, modest incremental improvement in industry spot pricing and the emergence of a stronger free cash flow estimate were the drivers of the upgrade, Gibbs said in a Sunday note. The firm's 2018 HRC pricing estimate is now up from $655 per ton to $670 per ton, while the CRC view is maintained at $825 per ton, lowering the HRC-to-CRC spread to $155 per ton compared to $190 per ton in 2017, according to KeyBanc. The spread is now easing closer to the trailing 10-year average of $120 per ton, Gibbs said. The normalization is a function of positive HRC standard deviation and less relative tightness in downstream products amid new capacity and import persistence, the analyst said. We believe spot HRC mill spreads will grow strongly in 2018, while downstream products will be more muted, Gibbs said. KeyBanc modestly increased its estimates for Timkensteel, citing an improving U.S. SBQ, or special bar quality, pricing and mix backdrop. The firm sees Timkensteel and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) to be more affected relative to Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) if the Trump administration's infrastructure narrative becomes dragged or disappoints, Gibbs said. The Price Action Over the past year, Timkensteel shares are down about 13 percent, with a year-to-date drop of about 4 percent.

2018-02-14,"Analyst: Steel Investors Need Action From Trump, Not Words","President Trump on Tuesday said he is considering a number of options for actions he could take to improve the struggling U.S. steel market, including imposing tariffs or quotas on imported steel. Trump said the U.S. steel industry is getting “decimated by dumping” of foreign steel into the market. I look at it two ways: I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry, and we do need that for national defense, Trump said. Trump has ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, the groundwork for him potentially using his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. In January, Trump made a similar decision to implement a 30 percent tariff on imported solar panels. Height Securities said on Wednesday that, despite Trump’s tough language, investors shouldn’t expect immediate action. Height said the potential for negative economic fallout from steel tariffs or alienation of key U.S. allies are two factors holding back the White House from making a move. “We expect that yesterday's meeting was intended primarily as a messaging tool by the White House and that the President's remarks, much like his threat of a ‘reciprocal tax’ from Monday, represents a return to campaign-style rhetoric rather than a clear indicator of immediate action,” Height said in a note. If Height is correct, the gains in steel stocks on Wednesday morning may be unwarranted, at least at this point: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 2.2 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) up 1.3 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) up 2.5 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) up 0.8 percent.

2018-02-16,"US Steel, Aluminum Stocks Rally After Commerce Dept. Calls For Tariffs","Steel and aluminum stocks moved sharply higher Friday after the U.S. Commerce Department issued a recommendation to President Donald Trump to enact steep tariffs or quotas on foreign companies. What You Need To Know Trump's administration looked into the topic of steel and aluminum imports and any potential impact on natural security, CNBC reported. Steel imports are weakening our internal economy and pose a threat to national security, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a Friday letter. Ross recommends the White House take immediate action by adjusting the level of imports through quotas or tariffs. Why It's Important The report calls for a global tariff of 24 percent on all steel imports, with another option calling for a tariff of at least 53 percent on steel coming from a dozen countries including Brazil and China, CNBC said. Ross recommended a 63-percent quota of the countries' 2017 imports. The report also calls for a 7.7-percent tariff on all imported aluminum for most countries, but a higher rate of 23.5 percent on aluminum products from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam. A higher quota of 86.7 percent was recommended in the aluminum report. What's Next? The White House would be able to exempt certain countries from a tariff or quota, and individual companies can seek an appeal if they have any U.S. production facilities. U.S. steel producers should be able to operate at 80-percent average capacity utilization rates or better based on the available capacity that existed in 2017 if action is taken against foreign companies, Ross said. Stock Reactions AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) gained more than 12 percent. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) gained more than 10 percent and hit a new 52-week high of $43.97. Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ:CENX) gained 8 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) gained 4 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) gained 4 percent. Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) gained 0.6 percent.

2018-02-20,Analysts Break Down The Sec. 232 Steel Investigation,"U.S. steel stocks are surging after the U.S. Commerce Department recommended that President Donald Trump enact a 24-percent tariff on all steel imports. Trump had ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, laying the groundwork for him to potentially use his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. The Commerce Dept. laid out three possible courses of action for the president: A blanket 24-percent tariff on all countries. A 50-percent tariff on the 12 largest U.S. importers and a quota equal to 100 percent of 2017 imports on all other countries. No tariff and a quota of 63 percent of 2017 imports on all countries. Investors clearly see the announcement as good news for domestic steel stocks. Here’s what analysts had to say. Voices From The Street Trump will likely opt for a tariff-and-quota scenario, said Morgan Stanley analyst Piyush Sood. “We think that the tariff-plus-quota scenario, with [a] 53-percent tariff against [the] selected 12 countries and [a] quota set to 100-percent (of 2017 import levels) is most likely to be adopted, the analyst said in a Monday note. Citigroup analyst Alexander Hacking said any of the three potential proposals the Commerce Dept. suggested would generate a significant tailwind for the domestic steel industry. “Prices would rise sharply, likely $150/ton, with [the] potential for shortages in the quota-limit scenarios,” Hacking said. Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen said the potential tariffs will be short-lived and may actually be designed to use as leverage in negotiations with exporting countries. “We still see significant problems with the structure of the Section 232 process and anticipate pushback from the Defense Dept. and other factions within the administration, which may hamper efforts to accelerate this process,” Allen said. Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Terry said quotas would have more immediate impact than tariffs. “Quotas on all countries will likely have the maximum impact as it would immediately support higher domestic utilization,” Terry said. BMO Capital Markets analyst David Gagliano said the major impact of the recommendation is that U.S. steel imports will likely drop. “We believe this will result in higher U.S. production, higher U.S. prices and lower unit costs,” he said. Credit Suisse analyst Curt Woodworth said Trump has plenty of motivation to act at this point. “In our view the president will likely follow through on some of these recommendations, given pressure from steel industry executives and the win it would serve up for his political base,” the analyst said. Price Action Here’s a rundown of how steel stocks are reacting to the news since Friday: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) is up 18.1 percent.

2018-03-01,"Height Securities: Concrete Proposal Unlikely To Emerge From Trump's Tariff Meeting With Steel, Aluminum Execs","President Donald Trump will meet with steel and aluminum executives Thursday, leading some to speculate an import tariff announcement is imminent, according to Reuters. But Height Securities considers a final proposal on rates or quotas unlikely to be released. “We expect that ongoing opposition from foreign partners, Congressional leaders, industry representatives from manufacturing industries and the Defense Department will push any final proposal further into March,” Height analysts said in a Thursday note. “ ... If we do receive any announcement today, it will likely be short on detail and may ignore aluminum altogether, as we understand the DoD has significant concerns with imposing any restrictions on aluminum imports.” More likely: a reiteration of Trump’s commitment to strong action, according to Height. Trump tweeted about the topic Thursday morning: Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2018 Headlines from the meeting are expected to bolster sentiment around the steel industry — but not necessarily around the U.S. economy. RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas said tariff talk should not be considered positive. The imposition of tariffs on steel & aluminum is not just bad policy but the worst form of crony capitalism. This will lead to higher consumer costs on autos & transportation. Why protection for firms that just got large tax cuts? — Joseph Brusuelas (@joebrusuelas) March 1, 2018 Height asserted that no meeting outcomes or policy perspectives are certain, considering the president’s mercurial mindset amid the Mueller investigation, staff turnover and “infighting among his closest advisers.” At the time of publication, U.S. steel stocks were trading higher off the open. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 5.3 percent, AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) 8.3 percent, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) 2 percent and Steel Dynamics, Inc.

2018-03-01,"Trump's Comments On Steel, Aluminum Tariffs Shake The Markets","Steel and aluminum stocks are popping on Thursday while the rest of the market crashes after President Donald Trump said he will be announcing new steel and aluminum tariffs as early as next week. What You Need To Know Trump said Thursday the U.S. will implement a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports, but didn't specify whether the tariffs will be applied to all imports or just imports from specific countries. “People have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,” Trump said. “By people representing up who didn’t have a clue.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 500 points Thursday afternoon, sitting around the 24,500 level at time of publication. The S&P 500 slid about 43 points. Why It’s Important The new metal tariffs are on the high end of what some analysts expected after the U.S. Commerce Department recommended a 24-percent tariff earlier this month. Back in January, Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on imported panels, most of which are coming from Asia. China, which is the largest international U.S. trade partner, is a major importer of both steel and solar panels. Politicians in both the EU and China have already threatened to retaliate against the U.S. if Trump implements import tariffs. The EU has said it's prepared to act “swiftly and appropriately” to restrictive U.S. trade measures by potentially implementing its own restrictions on U.S. exports such as bourbon, cheese, orange juice tomatoes and potatoes. EU officials could also reportedly target iconic American brands, such as Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). China is also reportedly already prepping for a trade war, investigating the possibility of restricting U.S. grain imports. What’s Next Investors will now be watching and waiting for further details on the new tariffs and any indication the market sell-off could soften Trump’s stance. In the meantime, Height Securities said on Thursday the steel tariffs are great news for U.S. steel stocks, potentially providing support for domestic prices and increasing profitability. “It is possible that Trump could use this meeting to confirm his commitment to taking strong action, especially on steel tariffs, and we expect that headlines will be positive for the affected steel companies,” Height said prior to Trump's announcement. Here’s a rundown of how steel and aluminum stocks reacted to the news on Thursday: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 7.6 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) was up 4.2 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) was up 10.9 percent. Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) was up 1.7 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) was up 2.4 percent. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was down 1.0 percent.

2018-03-02,"Trump's Steel Tariffs Are Stronger Than The Market Expected, Says Longbow Analyst","President Donald Trump’s decision to enact a 25-percent tariff on imported steel took the market by surprise Thursday and left analysts scrambling to update their outlook for U.S. steel stocks. The Analyst Longbow Research analyst Chris Olin reiterated Buy ratings for the following four steel stocks and adjusted the price targets as follows: Protectionist policies were already baked into steel stock prices and earnings outlooks, but Trump’s decision to opt for a 25-percent tariff was more aggressive than the market was anticipating, Olin said in a Friday note. Despite a recent run-up in steel stocks, the latest news leaves room for further upside, the analyst said. “We still expect steel mills to benefit from rapid upward spot price movement throughout 2018 with a higher-than-expected floor in 2019,” Olin said. As a result, he said Wall Street earnings estimates will need to be adjusted much higher in the coming days. Longbow is valuing U.S. steel stocks using a long-term HRC price range of between $750 and $775/ton. However, Olin expects prices to range between $850 and $875 per ton by the second quarter. Olin made the following adjustments to his 2019 EPS projections: Nucor raised from $1.75 to $7.33. Steel Dynamics raised from $1.03 to $5. U.S. Steel raised from $2.15 to $7.27. AK Steel raised from 24 cents to $1.25. Price Action The prices of all four steel stocks surged between 3 and 10 percent Thursday following Trump’s announcement. The stocks are now up between 15 and 54 percent in the past three months.

2018-03-09,"After Trump's Announcement Of Steel, Aluminum Tariffs, The Sell-Side Reacts","President Donald Trump unveiled plans for steel and aluminum tariffs Thursday, and several Wall Street analysts weighed in on what the tariffs could mean for the market. Voices From The Street The tariffs are good news for steel and aluminum stocks, while the exemptions will ease broader market fears, Cowen analyst Novid Rassouli said in a note. “We think that the steel group could see material upside given that spot steel prices will move higher, in our view, and the stocks are trading at a discount to current spot prices,” Rassouli said. Cowen has Outperform ratings on Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST). JPMorgan analyst Michael Gambardella said he is doubling down on his bullish call for steel stocks. “Following yesterday’s announcement from President Trump, we continue to believe that the 232 case and the tone that has been set by the administration on steel imports will help to create a much more constructive environment for domestic steel prices by improving the supply situation in the U.S.,” the analyst said. JPMorgan has upgraded Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) from Neutral to Overweight and maintains an Overweight rating on United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Height Capital Markets analyst Clayton Allen said AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS), U.S. Steel, Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ:CENX) and Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) face negative market sentiment following exemptions for Mexico and Canada. “Expectations from the steel and aluminum industries were high headed into yesterday's announcement, and Trump's late-stage decision to offer specific exemptions to both Canada and Mexico and possible exemptions to other allies meant the final tariffs failed to meet them,” Allen said. Mexico and Canada are two of the five largest U.S. steel importers flooding the market with supply, he said. Price Action Here’s how key aluminum and steel stocks traded following the tariff announcement Thursday: AK Steel is down 8.2 percent. Alcoa is down 1.1 percent. Century Aluminum is down 9.4 percent. U.S. Steel is down 6.8 percent. Commercial Metals is down 2.8 percent. TimkenSteel is down 1.3 percent. Steel Dynamics is down 3.4 percent.

The Analyst Goldman analyst Matthew Korn set the following ratings and price targets for metals and mining stocks: Initiated Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) with a Buy rating and $23 target. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) with a Buy rating and $78 target. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) with a Buy rating and $59 target. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.

Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI) with a Sell rating and $26 target. The Thesis Overall fundamentals in the North American mining and metals markets are very strong, Korn said. “Commodity prices are high, the supply side for metals and bulks looks more rational than it has been in years, M&M balance sheets are healthy (or at least healthier), and consumption has momentum from coordinated global growth, even as China gradually slows,” Korn said in the note. Korn said copper is the most attractive metal for Goldman at the moment, and Feeport McMoRan has the most copper exposure of the names mentioned. In addition, Korn said U.S. steel mills are expanding capacity with the support of new trade policy and aluminum demand is strong driven by a booming transportation industry. Price Action Here’s a look at how the stocks now covered by Goldman were following the initiation Tuesday: Freeport McMoRan was up 2.1 percent. Nucor was up 0.6 percent. Steel Dynamics was up 0.2 percent. Schnitzer was up 1.3 percent. Constellium was up 1.9 percent. Commercial Metals was down 0.4 percent. Allegheny Technologies was down 1.2 percent.

2018-06-14,KeyBanc Urges 'Selective Bias' On Carbon Steel Stocks,"Investors should continue holding a selective bias on carbon and steel stocks despite an increase in 2018 and 2019 hot rolled coil steel, or HRC, estimates, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The Analyst KeyBanc's Philip Gibbs downgraded Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) from Overweight to Sector Weight with no assigned price target. The analyst maintained an Overweight on Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) with a price target lifted from $97 to $100. The Thesis An analysis of the commodities sector that included surveys with C-level carbon sheet product distributors led KeyBanc to lift its 2018 HRC pricing estimate from $750/ton to $800/ton. The firm also lifted its 2019 HRC pricing estimate from $660 to $675, which on a dollar basis is a smaller uptick compared to 2018 and reflects the eventual easing of tariff effects, a higher 2019 U.S. sheet supply and stronger year-end import supply potential, Gibbs said in a report. The 20 C-level executives surveyed by KeyBanc reported above-average seasonal shipment and volume momentum in the second quarter with strength across all markets, especially construction, industrial and energy, the analyst said. The survey also found a modest amount of customer hedge buying in the second quarter, in contrast with the first quarter, when nearly 50 percent of respondents pointed to some customer hedge buying. Despite what appear to be encouraging industrywide fundamentals, investors need to be selective in their carbon steel equities for valuation reasons, Gibbs said. Many names in the group are modeled to report stellar near-term results due to tariffs, but face the potential for tougher 2019 year-over-year EPS comparisons, he said. Related Link: Analyst: For US Steel, Tariffs Are A Sell-The-News Event Aggressive On Reliance Steel, Not Steel Dynamics Among the entire sector, investors should prioritize free cash flow-rich companies that are building long-term earnings per share power, like Reliance Steel, Gibbs said. The stock boasts exposure to potential infrastructure spending projects; unpredictable, M&A activity; and has a higher return on invested capital due to tax reform, the analyst said. Steel Dynamics' stock has gained around 30 percent since mid-October, and the valuation of 6.5x and 8.6x EV/EBITDA on 2018 and 2019 estimates implies minimal upside potential, Gibbs said. Expectations for excessive profitability in the second and third quarter will normalize into 2019 amid a sheet supply-side recovery, he said. Price Action Steel Dynamics shares were trading down 0.14 percent off the open Thursday, while Reliance Steel shares were trading nearly flat.

2018-06-19,"BofA Downgrades Commercial Metals On Supply, Valuation Concerns","Since hitting a low of $19.65 on April 5, shares of Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) have gained about 23 percent, prompting Bank of America Merrill Lynch to revisit its rating on the equity. The Analyst Analyst Timna Tanners downgraded Commercial Metals from Neutral to Underperform and lowered the price target from $24 to $23. The Thesis Commercial Metals' valuation already reflects its much better-than-normal earnings power and its proposed plan to acquire four Gerdau U.S. rebar mills that's scheduled to close by the end of the year, Tanners said in a Tuesday note. (See the analyst's track record here.) On the downside, the analyst projects potential antitrust challenges to the Gerdau deal due to excess concentration, as imports now face a 25-percent Section 232 tariff, Tanners said. Taking into account the weakness of the Turkish lira — which is down 24 percent year-to-date — the price of imported rebar has dropped, resulting in a $125/ton discount to U.S. prices even after tariffs were applied, the analyst said. BofA expects U.S. rebar imports to rebound in Q4 after a summer dip, along with additional volume from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). The U.S. rebar market was oversupplied before the Trump administration's tariffs, Tanners said. Utilization remains below 80 percent, indicating limited pricing power, the analyst said. In recent midquarter updates on peers NUE and STLD we revisit valuation to use 'normal' multiples on conservative benchmark hot rolled coil and still find upside. BofA prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics to Commercial Metals. The Price Action Commercial Metals shares were down 3.86 percent at $23.15 at the time of publication Tuesday afternoon.

2018-08-27,"Wedbush Double Downgrades AK Steel, Makes Bullish Turn On 2 Rivals","Investors may want to reposition their steel holdings, as prices have dropped 4 percent since their mid-July peak, according to Morgan Stanley. The Analyst Morgan Stanley's Piyush Sood made the following rating and price target changes: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) from Overweight to Underweight, price target from $44 to $30. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) from Equal-weight to Overweight, price target from $6 to $5.50. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) from Equal-weight to Overweight, price target from $50 to $52. The Thesis Steel stocks haven't fully capitalized on the run-up in steel prices through July, and now that prices are falling due to seasonality and capacity restarts, any potential tailwinds from pricing have passed, Sood said in an industrywide report. (See the analyst's track record here.) The benefits from Section 232 tariffs are likely to only last until mid-2019, which suggests that now is the time for investors to become defensive, as cheap stocks can become even cheaper in the near-term, the analyst said. Given the recent changes in sentiment, Morgan Stanley's 2019 HRC price forecast of $760/t and 2020's forecast of $655/t remain unchanged but stocks should now be valued on a base year of 2020, which is a defensible mid-cycle year, Sood said. US Steel Double Downgrade Morgan Stanley's expectations for US Steel heading into Monday's downgrade were for higher 2019 prices and a sharp decline in 2020 due to the costs associated with continued asset revitalization, Sood said. While 2021 and beyond should see improvements at the company level, investors are unlikely to be willing to invest in a steel company today based on catalysts that are so far out at the top of the price cycle, he said. US Steel's cost levels throughout 2018 are higher than previously expected, and consensus estimates for $1 billion in 2019 capex are likely short by $200 million, the analyst said. The company's ongoing maintenance work in asset revitalization could in fact lead to more unparalleled outages, he said. AK Steel: Out Of The Penalty Box AK Steel's stock has been stuck in the penalty box amid poor guidance and concerns over equity issuances, Sood said. Yet the stock has moved lower and investors may want to step up to the buy window for two reasons, the analyst said. The company should benefit from higher pricing for around 25 percent of contract volume — 60-70 percent of total output — in the fourth quarter, with another favorable reset in the first quarter, Sood said. Morgan Stanley forecast that an increase in free cash flow yield from 14 percent in the second quarter to north of 20 percent in 2019 and 2020 should bring down leverage from 3.7 times LTM Net Debt to EBITDA to 1.8 times, which may eliminate any need for future equity issuances. Steel Dynamics: Top Mini-Mill Pick Mini-mill stocks are more defensive in nature than integrated names when steel prices are showing weakness, the analyst said Steel Dynamics boasts a better track record and stability in earnings versus its mini-mill peers, and its conservative management style and reputation of buying low-performance assets to turn them around implies a better likelihood of value creation for investors, he said. Price Action US Steel shares were trading lower by more than 1 percent at the time of publication Monday, while AK Steel was up 3.15 percent higher and Steel Dynamics was 2.49 percent higher.

2018-10-11,Seaport Global Says The Steel Industry Is Due For A Bounce,"Steel stocks have been in focus in 2018 after the steel industry was one of the first to be dragged into the global trade war. Steel stocks have run out of steam in recent months, but one analyst says the steel industry is due for a bounce. The Analyst On Thursday, Seaport Global analyst Derek Hernandez initiated coverage of the following five steel stocks: Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) - Buy rating, $75 price target. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) - Buy rating, $55 price target. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) - Buy rating, $35 price target. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) - Neutral rating, $5 price target. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) - Neutral rating, $20 price target. The Thesis U.S. policy uncertainty and recent declines in forward steel pricing have outweighed the bullish outlook for long-term global steel demand as of late. “Despite elevated earnings in 2018, valuations have pulled back significantly in recent months as doubt and insecurity have followed the year’s early exuberance. We view this pullback as an opportunity to buy market leaders,” Hernandez wrote in the note. Hernandez expects the Trump administration to continue to support the U.S. steel industry via Section 232 tariffs through at least 2020, despite investor concerns that an end to the Section 232 tariffs are always only a tweet away. While Hernandez says the steel tariffs are certainly on the table as a trade war bargaining chip, Trump would likely replace the tariffs with quotas in the event he agrees to drop them. While Hernandez is bullish on the U.S. steel space overall, he said Nucor is his top stock pick given its strong balance sheet, organic growth initiatives and potential for acquisitions.

2018-10-15,"Credit Suisse Downgrades American Steel Sector On Supply, Interest Rate Concerns","The volatile steel sector has yet to obtain the stamp of approval from sell-side firms despite expectations that President Donald Trump's tariffs could lend support. Ahead of the third-quarter reporting season, Credit Suisse downgraded the U.S. steel sector from Overweight to Market Weight. The Analyst Analyst Curt Woodworth has the following ratings and price targets for some of the steel and mining stocks in Credit Suisse's coverage universe: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X): Maintained Outperform/price target reduced from $48 to $40. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target reduced from $77 to $74. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target reduced from $55 to $51. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target increased from $11 to $13. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS): Maintained Outperform/price target increased from $6 to $7. The Thesis Increasing supply into the sheet market and concerns over rising interest rates that are hurting demand are the twin reasons behind Credit Suisse's downgrade of the steel sector, Woodworth said in a Monday note. (See his track record here.) Even as additional capacity is expected to come online from U.S. Steel, ArcelorMittal SA (NYSE:MT) and others, domestic steel production recently hit a four-year high, the analyst said, citing AISI data. Production rates are up by an annualized 6 metric tons, he said. At the same time, HRC prices continued to slide, Woodworth said. Credit Suisse also sees risks stemming from a potential rollback of tariffs due to the likelihood of the U.S. and Canada's NAFTA deal winning approval in early 2019. Electric arc furnace capacity expansions are expected to flood the market by 2020-21, according to Credit Suisse. The firm also expects downstream rolling capacity to ramp up in 2019-20. Capital allocation by steel companies has disappointed relative to investors' wish lists, Woodworth said. The analyst noted a surge in capex in 2018 — with the possibility of more to come in 2019 — and an increase in M&A activity. Although the analyst is in favor of a higher internal rate of return growth spend, he said the companies should have more balanced capital returns. The pace of share buybacks could also disappoint, Woodworth said. These factors could temper investor excitement in the sector, limiting the potential for multiple expansion given the peak margins and cycle fears, the analyst said. Credit Suisse's upbeat stance on U.S. Steel and AK Steel is due to expectations for upside to Street estimates for those companies on the basis of better 2019 contract pricing and more attractive valuations relative to historical forward multiples, Woodworth said. The Price Action The VANECK VECTORS/STL ETF (NYSE:SLX) was up 0.38 percent at $44.37 at the time of publication Monday.

2018-11-27,Steel Stocks Have Wall Street's Attention,"The U.S. steel industry has had a volatile couple of years with fluctuations in steel prices and uncertainty surrounding the fate of steel tariffs in an ongoing trade war. This week, several Wall Street analysts weighed in on steel stocks ahead of the G20 summit of world leaders. New Steel Mill After Monday's market close, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) announced plans to build a new $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion electric-arc-furnace (EAF) carbon sheet steel mill in the U.S. KeyBanc analyst Philip Gibbs said Steel Dynamics investors may have mixed feelings about the new mill. “U.S. carbon sheet-based stocks will likely be weaker tomorrow on the potential for further U.S. supply growth, while STLD investors may be a bit disappointed via potential for less bandwidth to pursue full-out share buyback momentum ($729M left at September's end),” Gibbs wrote in a note. Gibbs said the prospect of more steel supply in the U.S. market will likely weigh on steel prices and maintains a Sector Weight rating for Steel Dynamics stock. Steel Price Forecast On Tuesday, Longbow Research lowered its 2019 HRC steel spot price target by $10 to $15/ton and is now calling for 2019 prices to range between $790 and $795/ton. The new target represents roughly 5 percent downside from 2018 average prices. Despite the bearish adjustment, Longbow analyst Chris Olin reiterated his Buy rating and $40 price target for U.S. Steel (NYSE:X). “We believe the shares are significantly undervalued, even after adjusting for potential market headwinds,” Olin said. Sentiment Falling UBS analyst Andreas Bokkenheuser said net sentiment for the steel group declined in the third quarter. “Average Net Sentiment for all producers remained above global peers (possibly on account of Section 232 support), but directionally still down. We note that Net Sentiment serves as a potential leading indicator for operational performance,” Bokkenheuser wrote in a note. He said U.S. Steel has the highest net sentiment in the quarter, followed by Steel Dynamics, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS). UBS has the following ratings and price targets for the U.S. steel group: Nucor: Neutral, $63 target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral, $48 target. U.S. Steel: Sell, $28 target. AK Steel: Sell, $3.25 target.

2018-12-03,"Insider Buys Of The Week: Macquarie, Steel Dynamics, Sotheby's","Insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors. A couple of notable insider buys last week came from CEOs. Shares of two of these companies have been trading near 52-week lows. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10 percent owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly during periods of uncertainty. Here's a look at a few notable insider purchases reported in the past week. Macquarie Infrastructure Macquarie Infrastructure Corp (NYSE:MIC) saw its chief executive officer, Christopher Frost, add to his stake this past week. At a per-share price of $39.73, the 25,160 shares reportedly acquired, via a trust, cost around $999,600. Note that a director purchased 12,000 shares earlier in the month as well. Higher costs associated with acquisitions were in part to blame for the disappointing most recent quarterly report. But the stock ended last week at $41.70 per share, so Frost's latest purchase seems well timed. Shares traded as high as $67.84 in the past year, but the 52-week low is $36.20 and the consensus price target is $49.17. See Also: Insider Response To Tech's Volatile Autumn Steel Dynamics One Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) director made a notable share purchase this past week. At $33.85 apiece, the 20,000 shares acquired cost him about $677,000. His stake was listed as more than 5.0 million shares, compared with approximately 236 million of them listed as outstanding. Steel Dynamics has announced plans to build a new electric-arc-furnace carbon sheet steel mill in the United States for up to $1.8 billion. Still, shares sank to a new 52-week low of $33.38. They ended Friday at $35.20, which is around 6 percent lower in the past week, compared to a 3 percent or so gain the S&P 500. The consensus price target on the shares is $51.71. Sotheby's President and CEO Thomas Smith Jr. of Sothebys (NYSE:BID) also stepped up to the buy window this past week. He picked up 15,250 shares at between $40.73 and $41.11 apiece. That cost him more than $624,600. Smith reportedly made a gift of 15,250 shares and then purchased the same number of shares so as to retain his prior level of investment. This New York-based auctioneer posted better-than-expected quarterly results at the beginning of the month. But the stock was trading at $39.99 a share on last look, lower than the above purchase price range but more than the recent 52-week low of $37.66. The stock has traded as high as $60.16 in the past year. Analysts have a consensus price target of $55.20."

2019-01-28,"Morgan Stanley Upgrades US Steel, Sees Near-Term Bounce In Steel Prices","Steel stocks have taken a beating in the past year, but one Wall Street analyst said Monday a seasonal ramp in U.S. steel demand should help boost prices in the near-term. The Analyst Morgan Stanley analyst Piyush Sood made the following changes to his steel coverage: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) downgraded from Overweight to Equal-Weight, price target cut from $5 to $3. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) upgraded from Underweight to Equal-Weight, price target cut from $30 to $21. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $10.50 to $10. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $26 to $21. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $73 to $62. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) reiterated at Underweight, price target cut from $26 to $22. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Overweight, price target cut from $52 to $42. The Thesis Market dynamics should stabilize steel prices and most steel stocks in the first half of 2019, Sood said. However, he wouldn’t be surprised to see downward pressure on steel prices resume in the second half of the year. “As tariffs are eased further in 2019 and supply/imports increase, steel prices will once again come under pressure, beginning in 2H19,” Sood wrote in a note. He said buyers have mostly stayed on the sidelines in recent in anticipation of lower prices down the road. That dynamic drove hot rolled coil steel prices down from a peak of $920/t in summer 2018 to recent levels of between $640/t and $690/t. Morgan Stanley forecasts late Q1 and Q2 HRC prices of around $700/t driven in part by China stimulus demand. In the longer term, the firm is forecasting 2020 and 2021 HRC prices of $660/t and $640/t, respectively. Price Action Here’s how the steel stocks mentioned reacted to the new commentary Monday: U.S. Steel was down 0.1 percent. Steel Dynamics was down 0.4 percent. Schnitzer Steel was down 2.4 percent. Nucor was down 1.2 percent. Commercial Metals was down 1.1 percent. Cleveland Cliffs was down 1.9 percent. A.K. Steel was down 6.4 percent.

2019-04-11,Bank Of America Gives US Steel A Double Downgrade As Steel Prices Soften,"U.S. steel pricing is not where analysts had anticipated this spring, and one analyst says lower steel prices are bad news for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). The Analyst Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners downgraded U.S. Steel from Buy to Underperform and cut her price target from $31 to $18. The Thesis Steel prices typically peak during the spring season, but Bank of America’s latest pricing checks indicate hot rolled coil prices recently hit their lows for the year. Despite higher international iron ore prices, scrap prices dropped $25/t in April from March levels. Tanners says without a solid pricing environment, it will be very difficult for U.S. Steel to gain any traction in the market. “Our X downgrade reflects a view that without a near-term pricing catalyst, shares face headwinds from anticipated cash burn of $150-200M for 2019E-2021E amid elevated capex needs,” Tanners wrote in a note. U.S. steel typically prices between $50 and $100/t above landed import prices, but mills have recently been pricing sheets at or below import prices. After meeting with steel buyers, Tanners said U.S. mills are competing for market share by oversupplying the market and driving prices down. Bank of America cut its 2019 HRC price estimate from $730/t to $699/t, including a price forecast of $710/t in the second quarter. Tanners says given the difficult environment, she much prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD) over U.S. Steel given their near-term cash flow outlook. Price Action Following the downgrade and additional downgrade from Credit Suisse on Tuesday, U.S. Steel shares are down 15.8 percent on the week. The stock traded around $16.80 at time of publication.

The industry reacted to the report with stocks spiking higher for several U.S. steel and aluminum producers. What To Know Bloomberg cited unnamed sources as saying the tariffs will be dropped, with federal officials instead taking a stronger stance on enforcement, opening the door to ratification of USMCA.

2019-05-31,Bank Of America Double Downgrades Nucor Ahead Of 'Steelmageddon',"On May 14, U.S. President Donald Trump credited hit tariffs on imported steel with rebuilding the U.S. steel industry, which he said is now “booming.” However, shares of North Carolina steel producer Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) are down 25.9 percent in the past year, and one analyst double downgraded the stock on Friday. The Analyst Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners downgraded Nucor from Buy to Underperform and lowered her price target from $68 to $50. Tanners also made the following price target changes to steel stocks under her coverage: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $1 to $1. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $18 to $13. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $98 to $90. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $40 to $30. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $12 to $8. The Thesis Tanners said Nucor will likely be one of the first victims of what she calls a “steelmageddon” supply glut that will persist through 2021. As a result of oversupply concerns, Bank of America cut its 2022 benchmark hot rolled coil steel price forecast from $590/ton to just $475/ton. “Given a worse 2019E price view, risks of peak demand, and a looming supply glut in 2020-2021E, we see limited catalysts for the group and expect little incrementally positive from its June 20 investor day,” Tanners wrote in the note. Tanners said the supply glut will hurt all U.S. steel companies, but Steel Dynamics will be most immune given its attractive valuation, strong balance sheet, and near-term expansion opportunities. Price Action Nucor shares traded lower by 2.7 percent to $47.94 on Friday.

2019-06-04,Goldman Sachs Downgrades US Steel To Sell,"For the second time in a week, a Wall Street analyst has downgraded a major U.S. steel stock. This time, it’s United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) on the chopping block. The Analyst Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Korn downgraded U.S. Steel from Neutral to Sell and lowered his price target from $17 to $11. Korn also made the following adjustments to his steel price targets: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) reiterated at Sell, target dropped from $2.25 to $1.50. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $96 to $93. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $44 to $36. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $70 to $59. Stelco Holdings Inc (OTC:STZHF) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from C$18 TO C$17. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $27 to $25. The Thesis Less than a week after Bank of America downgraded Nucor, Korn said Tuesday weakening demand and plentiful supply are creating a drag on steel prices that will weigh on the steel stock group. “Weakening demand crossed with stubbornly high output from domestic mills has dragged steel sheet prices down to their lowest levels since 2016, and recent moves by the Trump Administration to weaken the Section 232 tariffs have contributed to expectations of ample available supply in the US market,” Korn wrote in a note. For U.S. steel specifically, Korn said lower steel prices will likely lead to additional earnings cuts and could even put pressure on the company’s bloated balance sheet. U.S. Steel recently announced a $1.2 billion investment in its Mon Valley Works facility that is being funded almost entirely by new debt. Korn is projecting $1.5 billion per year in capex for U.S. Steel from 2019 through 2021 versus just $645 million per year in operating cash generation. Price Action U.S. Steel shares traded around $12.78 at time of publication.

2019-07-22,Steel Dynamics Q2 Earnings Preview,"Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) will be releasing its next round of earnings this Monday, July 22. For all of the relevant information, here is your guide for Monday's Q2 earnings announcement.

Quarterly sales came in at $3.09 billion. The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 41.83% decline in the company's EPS figure. Sales would be down 8.77% from the year-ago period.

The strength of this rating has maintained conviction over the past 90 days."
2019-07-23,Steel Dynamics Analyst Projects Q3 Performance Decline,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reported second-quarter results after the close Monday and announced a new mill site. The earnings call scheduled for Wednesday is likely to focus on recent steel order trends and the company’s capital allocation, including the planned mill investment in Texas, according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The Analyst Philip Gibbs commented on Steel Dynamics’ second-quarter print and third-quarter prospects. The Thesis Steel Dynamics reported second-quarter FIFO adjusted EPS at 87 cents, missing KeyBanc’s estimate of 90 cents and the Street's expectation of 89 cents, Gibbs said in a Monday note. (See his track record here.) The company recorded adjusted EBITDA of $366 million, beating KeyBanc’s estimate of $360 million, while FCFE of $276 million fell short of the estimate of $333 million due to changes in net working capital, the analyst said. The results were driven by the steel segment, which delivered higher-than-expected shipments and ASPs, he said. The performance of fabrication, metals recycling and other segments was disappointing, Gibbs said. Steel Dynamics continues to expect strong underlying demand in the U.S. and an easing of customer de-stocking pressures, the analyst said. KeyBanc expects a strong sequential decline in third-quarter results due to lag pricing effects in sheet and lower spreads in SBQ products, although this could be partially offset by an expansion in spreads at raw materials and fabrication, he said. Steel Dynamics’ new greenfield mill site at Sinton, Texas is expected to cost $1.9 billion and begin construction in early 2020, according to KeyBanc; construction should ramp up in mid-2021. Price Action Steel Dynamics shares were trading up 1.05% at $31.87 at the time of publication Tuesday.

2019-07-23,"Budget Deal, Earnings Strength From Lockheed, CocaCola, United Technologies Lift Spirits","One thing Wall Street arguably never wants is uncertainty about the U.S. government paying its bills and keeping the lights on in Washington. Some of that worry flickered out on news of a budget deal between the White House and congressional leadership, so that could be helpful as trading gets started today. Meanwhile, the earnings treadmill rolled on Tuesday, getting an early jolt from The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) reporting better-than-expected results. Strong sales of its signature beverage helped things along. KO also raised its revenue forecast, something that might be an even better development than strong earnings because it’s forward-looking and says something positive about the economy. In other earnings news, United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) beat expectations and lifted guidance, while Travelers Companies Inc (NYSE:TRV) beat on revenue but missed on earnings per share. UTX shares rose 2% and TRV fell about 1% before the opening bell. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) shares rallied 2% in pre-market trading after the defense company surpassed analyst estimates on top- and bottom-lines and raised its forecasts for both. So far, about 18% of S&P 500 companies have reported Q2 results. Of those, 78.5% have surpassed analyst expectations on the bottom line, while 67% have reported better-than-expected revenues, according to FactSet. Earnings growth is 3.6% so far, but we’re really just getting started. Most analysts expect overall earnings to fall in Q2. Overseas, things looked solid overnight, and might give U.S. markets some traction. Growing hopes for more economic stimulus when the European Central Bank (ECB) meets this week appear to be helping stocks in Europe. There was also some talk about the U.S./China trade situation early this week, with media reporting the chance of face-to-face talks resuming between negotiators. That story goes day-to-day, so maybe consider not getting too up or down about any media reports. Still, people are paying very close attention. Earnings Tide Rolling In Monday felt like the calm before the storm as investors geared up for this week’s flood of earnings reports. The rest of the week’s schedule is hyperbolic. Only a few major firms posted results on Monday, but the list grows as the week continues. Today’s action began with LMT, KO, Biogen Inc (NASDAQ:BIIB), and Kimberly-Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB), among many others. After the bell today, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) and Visa Inc (NYSE:V) are on the list, followed tomorrow morning by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA), and Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT). The market could be driven by short-term events, as it often is during earnings season, and the hot sector one day might not be so hot the next. If you’re a long-term investor, it could be prudent not to get too caught up in the day-to-day noise. Some of the trends to consider watching as earnings continue include not just whether companies beat Wall Street’s expectations, but also the quality of their earnings and what executives say about the coming quarters. It’s a judgment call when it comes to “quality” earnings, but if revenue rises from a year earlier and bottom line growth reflects more than one-time events like a tax benefit, that could be a sign. Expectations among analysts are generally low, so a lot of companies are probably going to beat and get a 9th-place “participation” trophy. If earnings beat but they’re down from a year ago, that’s sometimes a signal that all might not be well despite the headline being positive. It’s important to consider digging a bit deeper at times like these to sound out which companies are truly doing well and which ones only seem to be. Technology Ignited as Week Begins One sector where analysts’ expectations are relatively high is Technology, which has been leading the way all year. That didn’t change Monday, with Technology climbing more than 1% to pace all sectors as many of the chip stocks had a great day. These chip names certainly could be among the hardest hit if the China tariff situation goes south, but even if it does, you could make an argument for the chip sector. We know these products are needed. Gamers, especially, want the fastest chips, so there is demand. Chips appeared to get their latest boost from an analyst upgrade to Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) and a few other names. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index rose 2%. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) was another beneficiary of an analyst report Monday as Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) raised its price target on the stock. AAPL is up 30% year-to-date, and the upgrade was based on what MS called “improving” iPhone and services data points. MS said it sees “multiple catalysts” beyond earnings for AAPL. We’ll have to wait and see, but it looks like strength in AAPL was another factor aiding Technology early in the week. Apple reports next week and its results often have a big impact on the market. Apple is in advanced talks to buy Intel’s smartphone modem-chip business, the Wall Street Journal reported, another step in what could be a major push for internal modem development. Treasury yields held pretty much steady early Tuesday, with some analysts wondering how long the 10-year Treasury note can hold above 2%. It’s at just below 2.05% now. As some point out, this week’s ECB meeting is widely expected to result in a rate cut or some other type of stimulus, maybe leading to even more negative rates in Europe when they’re already at all-time lows. U.S. interest rates don’t operate in a vacuum, so even if economic data here look supportive, yields could stay under pressure from overseas developments. There are data this week sprinkled among the dozens of earnings reports, and today brings June existing home sales. New home sales come tomorrow. There’s also the Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index this morning, which might get a closer look than normal because of concerns about business confidence. A two-year Treasury note auction is also on today’s calendar. Healthy Consumer in Focus Ironically, the dollar is rising lately despite the looming chance of a rate cut next week. There wasn’t a big move Monday, but the Dollar Index is back near 97.3 after falling well under 97 earlier this summer. This could be a reflection of solid U.S. jobs and retail sales data last month, both of which pointed to potential economic strength. Early results from earnings also seemed to show a healthy U.S. consumer, which isn’t too surprising when you consider how low borrowing costs are and the fact that we’re arguably near full employment. Geopolitics retreated a bit early in the week, but that doesn’t mean they can’t jump right back in the way they did last Friday. The Iran situation is still fluid, but the lack of a major rally in crude probably speaks to how the world is less dependent on Persian Gulf oil than it used to be, media reports reminded us. That said, U.S. crude production could start easing back a little as producers have been reducing the number of active rigs for some time. Crude prices gave back some ground early Tuesday after some initial gains.

Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Gear Up for Boeing Tomorrow: Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) will likely be front and center tomorrow morning as investors gear up for the latest update on the troubled 737 MAX. One thing to consider is that this isn’t just the story of one company. The grounding of the MAX has far-reaching implications. Let’s not forget all the other companies that contribute parts that go into a plane. We might not see an impact from the MAX grounding in this week’s Q2 gross domestic product (GDP) report, but it could end up affecting future GDP numbers and have a wider impact on the economy. For BA itself, this is looking like a long road. When a company has smoke—whether it’s a Department of Justice investigation, unusual taxes, or product safety—these stories always seem to take longer than you think to resolve. Look at Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC). They’re three years out from the fake accounts scandal and still getting asked about it on their earnings calls. It still haunts them. Failure to Thrive: While its cousin gold basked in the headlines last week at six-year highs, copper hid behind the scenes, unable to escape the range-bound trading it’s been locked in since mid-May (See Figure 1 above). Copper might not be the shiniest metal on the block, but many investors watch its progress to get a sense of demand for the industrial metal used in so many technology products. Copper stirred some excitement in mid-2018 when moved above $3 a pound for the first time since 2015. It’s been stuck in the mud since then and recently traded at $2.71, well under the 2019 high of just under $3. That’s about where it was back in 2006 before everyone had a smartphone in their pockets made partly from copper. Copper isn’t the only industrial commodity under the weather this year. Natural gas futures fell to their lowest levels since 2016 recently, and crude just hasn’t made much traction above $60 a barrel for U.S. futures. Lumber market action isn’t too solid, either. The bearish takeaway might be that all this points to low industrial demand, but a bullish view would say low prices could make business less costly for companies and maybe spark some growth. Producer prices for industrial commodities have leveled out over the last few months, according to government data. Steel Yourself: Last week and the week before featured company reports from a few less-closely followed firms that provided insight into wider economic demand. Yesterday’s earnings from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) is another one that fits into that mold. The company, with around $12 billion in annual revenue, is one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers in the U.S. Though its earnings are already out, it might be interesting to tune into this morning’s earnings conference call to get a sense of how executives feel about the fundamental environment looking ahead to Q3 and Q4. Sometimes it’s less about the numbers and more about the feeling you get on the conference call.

2019-07-26,Steel Dynamics To Build $1.9 Billion Mill In South Texas Near Gulf Of Mexico,"Indiana-based Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) announced it will build a $1.9 billion mill in Sinton, Texas, about 25 miles northwest of the Port of Corpus Christi. The site for the new mill is strategically located for the southwestern United States and Mexican markets, the company said in a statement July 23. Steel Dynamics is one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers in the U.S. We have been developing a flat roll steel business strategy for this region and Mexico for several years, said Mark Millett, president and chief executive officer of Steel Dynamics. We believe a majority of the customer base will experience a significant freight savings compared to their current supply-chain configurations. The mill will use electric furnaces to turn scrap metal into sheets and strips of steel for the energy, automotive, construction and appliance industries. The mill project could generate between $113 million to $223 million a year, Steel Dynamics reported in a filing with the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts. Millet said the new mill site will provide access to several markets where the company believes demand for steel will grow, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and the West Coast. The site already has transport access to railroads and highways, and the Port of Corpus Christi and is less than 200 miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. Sinton is a town of around 5,000 people located in a region of Texas known as the Coastal Bend. The Gulf of Mexico is less than 30 miles away. Steel Dynamics said there will be around 600 full-time jobs at the new mill. Workers at the plant could earn up to $80,000, according to the Corpus Christi Regional Economic Development Corp. The new steel mill could be finished and operating by 2020, Millet said. This is a wonderful employer that will have a major positive impact that will be felt throughout the region, said Iain Vasey, president and chief executive officer of the Corpus Christi Regional Economic Development Corp. Fort Wayne, Indiana-based Steel Dynamics currently operates six steel mills, including facilities in Indiana, Michigan, Mississippi and Pennsylvania. Three of Steel Dynamics' mills are located in Pittsburgh. The company employs around 8,000 workers. Image Sourced by Pixabay"

2019-09-04,Bank Of America Cuts Steel Earnings Estimates Across The Board,"Bank of America has cut its forecast for U.S. steel prices and dialed back its earnings expectations for American steel stocks across the board. On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners cut her price target for U.S. hot-rolled coil in the second half of 2019 from $628 per short ton to $572. Tanners also issued the following 2019 EPS cuts for popular U.S. steel stocks: Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) cut from $2.05 to $1.95. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) cut from to $4.65 to $4.60. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) cut from $9.20 to $8.99. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) cut from $3.25 to $3.19. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) cut from 79 cents to 75 cents. “On Q2 calls, mills were constructive on demand improving in H2E, but we see risk of weaker volumes and prices, based on our channel checks and recent macro data,” Tanners wrote in a note. No Major Catalysts Ahead Fortunately, Tanners said steel prices could find some near-term support from planned maintenance outages at major mills in coming months. While lower imports would theoretically boost domestic demand, Tanners said many buyers loaded up on inventory after producers announced price hikes over the summer. She said slowing economic growth in China also runs the risk of flooding the market with excess steel given China increased its production by 10% in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, Tanners remains pessimistic about the steel group given more supply cuts are likely in the cards. Bank of America’s top picks in the group are Neutral-rated Reliance and Steel Dynamics. Benzinga’s Take A Neutral rating is far from a vote of confidence. Buying shares of Reliance or Steel Dynamics at this stage would be akin to buying the best house in a bad neighborhood. Investors may want to consider steering clear of steel until the market shows signs of improvement. Do you agree with this take? Email feedback@benzinga.com with your thoughts.

2019-09-06,BMO: Limited Near-Term Upsides For Steel Dynamics,"While Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) has good long-term prospects, there are limited company-specific catalysts that could lend meaningful upside to shares in the near term, according to BMO Capital Markets. The Analyst BMO’s David Gagliano downgraded Steel Dynamics from Outperform to Market Perform while lowering the price target from $40 to $30. The Thesis Steel Dynamics’ long-term growth prospects seem underappreciated, especially after the company announced plans to construct a greenfield flat-rolled mill in Texas, Gagliano said in the downgrade note. He added, however, that between 2019 and 2022, Steel Dynamics has higher exposure to near-term spot steel pricing volatility. The analyst cited two reasons for this. First, the company’s free cash flow buffer is currently lower than it has been historically, given the planned increase in capital expenditure during 2020-2022. And second, Steel Dynamics has much higher-than-peers near-term EBITDA sensitivity to changes in underlying spot sheet prices. Although Steel Dynamics could generate healthy volume growth in the longer term, there is more downside risk than upside potential to underlying spot prices till the end of 2019, Gagliano said. Price Action Shares of Steel Dynamics had declined more than 1.46% to $27.65 at the time of publishing.

2019-09-16,"Nucor Lowers Q3 Earnings Guidance, Sees 'Softening' In Some Markets","Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) lowered its earnings guidance for the third quarter ending Sept. 28 on Monday and said it expects earnings to be in the range of 75 cents to 80 cents per diluted share. The news sent shares of steel companies trading lower. Nucor's second-quarter earnings were $1.26 per diluted share, and the guidance also represents a year-over-year decrease from earnings of $2.13 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. The performance of the steel mills segment in the third quarter of 2019 is expected to decrease compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower prices for sheet and plate steel. “Although we still see stability in most of the end use markets that we serve, there has been some softening in automotive, agricultural products and power transmission markets,” the company said in a statement. Outlook By Segment Nucor said it expects the profitability of the steel products segment to improve sequentially in the third quarter, as nonresidential construction market conditions remain strong. In addition, recently enacted efficiency initiatives in rebar fabrication and metal buildings are enhancing performance from those businesses, the company said. Nucor said the performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the third quarter due to further margin compression in the company's direct reduced iron businesses. Price Action Nucor shares were trading down 1.06% at the time of publication.

2019-09-18,Steel Dynamic's Q3 Guidance Comes In Worse Than Expected,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) issued third-quarter earnings guidance Tuesday in the range of 66 to 70 cents per diluted share vs. a Street estimate of 71 cents. The company said it expects third-quarter earnings from the company's steel operations to decrease sequentially from the second quarter. Steel Dynamics cited lower profitability from the company's sheet steel operations, as shipments and average steel pricing declined in the quarter, more than offsetting lower scrap costs. The underlying demand for domestic steel remains principally intact for the primary steel-consuming sectors, according to Steel Dynamics, with the construction segment being particularly strong. The company also expects lower third-quarter profits in its metals recycling platform. Earnings from the steel fabrication business are expected to improve sequentially, according to Steel Dynamics. The company continues to experience strong steel fabrication order backlogs and customers remain optimistic concerning non-residential construction projects. Steel Dynamics shares were trading down 1.07% at $30.63 in Wednesday’s premarket session. The stock has a 52-week high of $48.17 and a 52-week low of $25.02.

2019-09-19,US Steel Joins Chorus of Steelmakers Warning Of Q3 Underperformance,"The steel industry's cup of woes overflows, as evidenced by a string of warnings from a few of the biggest players in the sector. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) became the latest to warn of worsening fundamentals when it made a third-quarter pre-announcement late Wednesday. U.S. Steel shares were sinking 13.455 to $10.78 at the time of publication Thursday. Way Off The Mark The steelmaker said in a release it expects third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million, which excluded a $53-million impact from a fire at its Clairton coke making facility and estimated restructuring charges. The Pittsburg-based company now expects an adjusted third-quarter loss of 35 cents per share, notably wider than the 7-cent per share loss estimated by analysts, on average. Brittle Fundamentals After the strength witnessed in the summer, the flat-rolled steel market has softened, U.S. Steel said. The combination of falling steel prices through the second quarter and a bigger-than-expected drop in scrap prices will negatively impact flat-rolled earnings in the second half of the year, according to the company. U.S. Steel now expects full-year flat-rolled shipments to third-party customers to be 10.7 million tons, as it expects to idle two of its U.S. blast furnaces to match supply with demand forecasts. U.S. Steel also warned of a continued deterioration of market conditions in Europe, with the incongruence between steel selling prices and raw material costs pressuring margins. In line with its labor productivity strategy announced earlier, the company has thus far eliminated 1,800 positions of the planned 2,500 cuts planned by the end of 2021. Pressured by high import levels and weakening market conditions, the company's Tubular segment is expected to remain under pressure for the remainder of the year, U.S. Steel said. Not Alone In The Quagmire U.S. Steel's predicament is not company-specific, as two other big giants sounded the alarm in their guidance as well. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) pre-announced a third-quarter shortfall earlier this week, citing weakness in its steel mills and raw materials business. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) said Wednesday it expects third-quarter earnings of 68-70 cents per share, below the 71-cents-per-share consensus estimate, as shipments and average steel pricing of its sheet steel operations declined in the quarter.

2019-09-19,PreMarket Prep Recap: Buybacks Add Fuel To Rally Ahead Of Quadruple Witch Expiration,"At the top of Thursday's PreMarket Prep show, the likelihood of follow-through from the late rally in Wednesday's session was debated. Two factors increasing the chance of that were the overall reaction from the Fed's action, a buyback from Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) and a dividend raise and buyback by the S&P 500 index top component Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). From the premarket action, it appeared that Microsoft was more likely to make a new all-time high than Target, which turned out to be the case. Overstock, Steel Sector Guidance And Good News From RH The impact of the former CEO of Overstock.com Inc (NASDAQ:OSTK) dumping all of his shares was discussed. The only major support level that could halt the decline would be its Sept. 3 low of $14.72, Dick said. Off the open, the issue continued lower but found support a few pennies above that low and has rebounded back into the mid-$15 handle. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) followed the lead of Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) in lowering third-quarter guidance, and it was deep in the red in premarket trading. The warnings came at a bad time for investors in the sector, as the issues had distanced themselves from recent lows. On the opposite end of the guidance spectrum was Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc (NYSE:RH), which raised its 2019 guidance just one week after upbeat second-quarter results. Buyers were able to nudge the issue to a new all-time-high, but the stock surrendered all of those gains and has gone red on the session. Chaikin Bullish, Johnson Bearish Once again, Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU) made a move during the show. This time it was to the upside, as the company announced a new streaming player line-up. This helped end the slide instigated by Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The two companies announced Wednesday that they were entering the streaming fray. Roku's rally from the premarket session carried over into Thurdsay's regular session, but it has come nowhere near Wednesday's high ($145.75). Surely, investors caught in the issue's massive sell-off are lightening up into the rally. A pair of guests joined the show with differing views of the markets. Marc Chaikin of Chaikin Analytics exuded optimism for the rally to continue, while Gordon Johnson of GLJ Research pointed out several negatives with respect to the U.S. and Chinese economies and a not-so-favorable outlook for the steel. electric vehicle, solar and cannabis sectors. Schwartz Joins Friday's Show On the final show of the week, Jerremy Schwartz, director of research at Wisdom Tree Investments Inc (NASDAQ:WETF), will comment on Fed's recent action, oil and the return of small-cap value.

2019-10-10,US Steel's Stronger-Than-Expected Preliminary Q3 Results Send Sector Higher,"United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) shares were trading higher Thursday after the company reported preliminary third-quarter results that outperformed gloomy guidance issued last month. The company expects a preliminary net loss in the range of $84 to $94 million, or a loss of 49-55 cents per diluted share. U.S. Steel reported a preliminary adjusted net loss of approximately $35 to $45 million, or a loss of 20-26 cents per share. Third-quarter preliminary adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $134 to $144 million. Stronger shipments and better than expected manufacturing performance in our flat-rolled segment, as well as a contingency gain from recovered claims arising out of the bankruptcy of a supplier drove better than expected results, the company said in a statement.

2020-07-06,What A Biden Victory Could Mean For US Steel Industry,"U.S. steel stocks have had a tough run under President Donald Trump, but Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners says things might not get much better for steel stocks if presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House in November. Biden now has a 20-point lead over Trump, according to the online prediction market PredictIt.org. While steel investors may assume a Democratic victory in November would result in the rollback of Trump’s Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, Tanners said tariffs have historically been a nonpartisan issue. Both sides of the political aisle voiced concerns about Trump’s steel tariffs. While the tariffs seemingly haven’t done much to improve steel prices and margins during the Trump presidency, Tanners said Monday that removal of the tariffs at this point would have a negative impact on prices during a critical period for the industry in which it is overbuilding capacity. Other Political Factors One potential partisan headwind for the steel industry could be the fate of Trump’s border wall with Mexico. Most of the pipe for the proposed border was expected to be delivered by the end of 2020. Tanners said Democrats would likely halt construction of the wall, but whether or not they would tear down and scrap what has already been built could have a major impact on near-term steel prices. Two additional major political catalysts could have a significant impact on the US steel industry, according to Tanners. First, Biden’s plan to raise corporate tax rates from 21% to 28% would hurt steel stocks is Democrats gain control in Washington. However, a clean sweep by Democrats could also improve the chances that an infrastructure spending bill will be passed, a potential positive tailwind for steel demand. How To Play It For now, Tanners said investors should be careful in the U.S. steel space. “Ultimately, a potential Democrat win would add to our already cautious thesis on most U.S. steel names,” Tanners wrote in a note. Bank of America has Underperform ratings on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Bank of America has a $34 target for Nucor, a $23 target for Steel Dynamics and a $3 target for U.S. Steel. Benzinga’s Take At this point, the U.S. steel group is a highly speculative space given the tremendous political risk and uncertainty regarding the election and the potential outlook in 2020 and beyond. Add in the uncertainty created from the COVID-19 outbreak and the trade war with China, and there are simply too many unknowns for investors to have much confidence in steel stocks these days.

2020-12-29,Understanding Steel Dynamics's Ex-Dividend Date,"On November 19, 2020, Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) announced shareholders can expect to receive a dividend payable on January 15, 2021. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Steel Dynamics has an ex-dividend date planned for December 30, 2020. The company's current dividend payout sits at $0.25. That equates to a dividend yield of 2.81% at current price levels. The Significance Of An Ex-Dividend Date Ex-dividend dates signal when company shares cease to trade with their current dividend payouts. There is a small intermission period before companies announce new dividends. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. Steel Dynamics's Dividend History Over the past year, Steel Dynamics has experienced an overall upward trend regarding its dividend payouts and a downward trend regarding its yields. Last year on December 30, 2019 the company's payout was $0.24, which has since grown by $0.01. Steel Dynamics's dividend yield last year was 3.02%, which has since decreased by 0.21%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market.

2021-01-08,Here's How The US Steel Industry Is Getting Greener,"The U.S. steel industry is leading the world in turning its business green. In a note out on Friday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said U.S. steel producers like United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) already produce some of the world’s greenest steel, and their shift to electric arc furnace (EAF) production will reduce their carbon footprints even further. Steel Emissions Targets: EAFs are about 75% more emissions-efficient than traditional blast furnace steel mills, according to Tanners. Today, only 28% of global steel production comes from EAFs. The International Energy Agency has said the global steel industry should aim to boost that percentage to 40% by 2030. Related Link: Cleveland-Cliffs' ArcelorMittal Asset Purchase Could Help Combat 'Steelmageddon' However, the U.S. steel industry is already paving the path to a greener future, on track to produce more than 80% of its total output via EAFs by 2023. In addition to lessening its impact on the planet, Tanners says public steel companies have major financial incentives to go green. “Our equity strategists in early 2020 estimated $20T of asset inflows would be directed into impact investing over the next few decades, with $3T of assets already using climate change in their investment decisions,” she wrote the note. How To Play It: Steel stocks are going green, but Tanners said that doesn’t necessarily mean steel stock investors will be seeing green in the near future given the pricing pressures the industry is facing. Bank of America has the following ratings and price targets for U.S. steel stocks: U.S. Steel: Underperform rating, $8 target. Commercial Metals: Neutral rating, $22 target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral rating, $40 target. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Underperform rating, $45 target. Benzinga’s Take: The best hope for U.S. steel stock investors in the near-term would be an aggressive infrastructure spending plan from the Biden administration. President-elect Joe Biden has floated the idea of a $2 trillion Build Back Better infrastructure plan that could provide a shot in the arm for steel industry demand."

2021-03-31,"3 Steel Stocks Heating Up This Week: US Steel, Steel Dynamics, Nucor Technical Levels","Steel stocks have been heating up this week, with bullish moves in a few tickers. United States Steel Corp. (NYSE:X), Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Nucor Corp. (NASDAQ:NUE) are three steel movers. These stocks may be potential long-term investments. Below is a daily chart analysis for each of the three stocks. US Steel Daily Chart Analysis: The daily chart above shows there are three potentially key levels on the U.S Steel chart. The stock may have broken out of a channel. The stock was previously trading in a channel between the price levels of $20 and $25 before the stock broke above the $25 level. This $25 level needs to hold for the stock to see higher moves. Below the $25 level, the stock may not find support until the $20 level, and below $20 not until $16. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support. Steel Dynamics Daily Chart Analysis: The chart shows the stock has been in an uptrend throughout the last year, which can be shown by connecting the lows with a line. The stock recently broke above $44, an area it struggled to get over in the past. The stock then found support at this level. This is an area the stock may stay above in the future. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support. Nucor Daily Chart Analysis: Nucor stock has taken off over the last week, making new highs. The chart recently broke above resistance of $67.50 and was able to retest it as support. This is an area where the stock may find support again in the future. If the stock were to fall below $67.50, it might not find support again until $57.50. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support."
2021-04-07,Record Steel Prices Create Investment Opportunities For These 4 Stocks,"U.S. hot-rolled coil steel prices recently hit all-time highs of $1,300 per short ton. Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said Wednesday that record prices will generate huge profits for steel mills in the first half of 2021. Heading into first-quarter earnings season, Tanners said investors will be watching closely for indications from management about how steel companies will be spending their excess cash. Excess Cash: Tanners said some companies will obviously use the near-term cash windfall to pay down debt and improve unhealthy balance sheets. However, she said companies with healthy balance sheets, such as Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) and Ternium SA (NYSE:TX), have several options for how to allocate that extra cash. Related Link: Gordon Johnson On 'Perfect Storm For The Steel Mills': Why He's Bullish On US Steel, Cleveland-Cliffs One likely scenario is they will use a significant portion of it to fund working capital growth for downstream operations, Tanner said. She added that management may be hesitant to spend the cash on buybacks given the steel market appears to be at or near a cyclical peak. That same line of reasoning could discourage M&A deals in the near future given the current steel environment is a seller’s market. “While we think M&A could heat up, aided by low interest rates and plentiful cash, we see limited options for mills and likely more downstream processing and bolt-on growth, such as NUE’s recent pipe mill or a new galvanizing or paint line, typically ~$250-300M,” Tanners said. How To Play It: Tanners is projecting steel prices will trend “sharply lower” in the second half of 2021. Bank of America has the following ratings and price targets for the steel stocks mentioned: Nucor: Underperform rating, $56 price target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral rating, price $49 target. Reliance Steel: Buy rating, $167 price target. Ternium: Buy rating, $44 price target. Benzinga’s Take: All four steel stocks mentioned are up at least 45% in the past six months, so the excess cash flow Tanners is expecting in the first half of 2021 may already be priced into the stocks to a large degree. The big question for steel stock investors is when steel prices start to pull back and how deep that pullback will be. (Photo: Ternium)"

2021-04-16,Steel Dynamics Earnings Preview,"Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) releases its next round of earnings this Monday, April 19. Here is Benzinga's essential guide to Steel Dynamics's Q1 earnings report. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see Steel Dynamics reporting earnings of $1.89 per share on sales of $3.39 billion. In the same quarter last year, Steel Dynamics reported earnings per share of $0.88 on sales of $2.58 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the consensus estimates; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an earnings surprise, which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Monday, earnings would be up 114.77%. Revenue would be up 31.65% on a year-over-year basis. Steel Dynamics's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q4 2021 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate 0.83 0.47 0.32 0.79 EPS Actual 0.97 0.51 0.47 0.88 Revenue Estimate 2.53 B 2.21 B 2.06 B 2.56 B Revenue Actual 2.60 B 2.33 B 2.09 B 2.58 B Stock Performance Shares of Steel Dynamics were trading at $50.89 as of April 15.

2021-04-20,"BofA Upgrades Steel Dynamics, Nucor Amid Record Steel Prices","U.S. steel prices remain at record highs. One analyst says investors shouldn’t fight the trend and upgraded two steel stocks. The Analyst: Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners upgraded Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD) from Neutral to Buy and raised her price target from $49 to $61. Tanners also upgraded Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) from Underperform to Neutral and raised her price target from $56 to $80. In addition to the upgrades, Tanners reiterated ratings on the following steel stocks: Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS): Buy rating, price target raised from $167 to $182. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC): Underperform rating, price target raised from $24 to $25. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Underperform rating, price target raised from $12 to $14. Related Link: Record Steel Prices Create Investment Opportunities For These 4 Stocks The Thesis: Tanners said the U.S. steel market has bucked multi-decade downward pricing trends and set new record in 2021. Tanners said steel prices will normalize once the industry works through the current patch of temporary undersupply produced by COVID-19 related production disruptions. However, she said the near-term earnings windfall for steel companies as a result of the spike in steel prices could have a positive impact on the balance sheets of the top steel stocks through at least the first three quarters of 2021. “STLD and NUE not only have better balance sheets as a result of this unprecedented steel environment, but in our view are well positioned to continue to dominate and operate capacity even assuming oversupply down the road,” Tanners wrote in the note. She said U.S. Steel will likely get the least benefit from the near-term windfall profits given it needs more than $2 billion in major repairs to existing assets. Benzinga’s Take: Record steel prices may not last, but both Nucor and Steel Dynamics appear to already be pricing in a pullback in steel prices at some point. Nucor shares trade at just 18.8 times forward earnings, while Steel Dynamics has a forward earnings multiple of just 14.9."

2021-04-20,A Look Into Steel Dynamics Debt,"Shares of Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) increased by 32.55% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Steel Dynamics has. Steel Dynamics's Debt Based on Steel Dynamics's financial statement as of March 1, 2021, long-term debt is at $3.02 billion and current debt is at $106.55 million, amounting to $3.12 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.37 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $1.75 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Steel Dynamics has $9.27 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.34. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, interest-payment obligations can have an adverse impact on the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-04-28,'Unprecedented Steel Bubble': Here's How To Play It,"Record U.S. steel prices have steel stocks soaring, but Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said Wednesday the steel stock party won’t last forever. Tanners recently did a deep dive on past steel price peaks and found a history of sharp drops in steel prices and stocks. History Lesson: So far, Tanners has seen no evidence that U.S. steel prices have reached the current cycle’s peak given new capacity has been delayed until late 2021. Hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel prices recently ranged between $1,400 and $1,500 per ton, more than double their 10-year average of $641. Prior steel price peaks in 2004, 2008, 2016 and 2018 suggest steel stocks will peak roughly a month before steel prices do, suggesting investors should be watching stock prices more closely than steel prices. Related Link: BofA Upgrades Steel Dynamics, Nucor Amid Record Steel Prices How To Play It: Tanners said past steel market corrections have hit higher-levered stocks hardest, which doesn’t bode well for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Instead, she prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), both of which should be able to offset the negative impact of falling steel prices by ramping up capacity. No matter what, Tanners said investors need to understand the risks in the steel space these days. “A cautious and nimble approach is best navigating cyclicals late in the price cycle amid an unprecedented steel bubble, in our opinion,” she wrote in a note. Benzinga’s Take: Record steel prices may not last, but both Nucor and Steel Dynamics appear to already be pricing in a pullback in steel prices at some point. Nucor shares trade at just 17.6 times forward earnings, while Steel Dynamics has a forward earnings multiple of just 13.7."

2021-06-16,Price Over Earnings Overview: Steel Dynamics,"Looking into the current session, Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) is trading at $61.10, after a 3.29% decrease. Over the past month, the stock fell by 1.78%, but over the past year, it actually went up by 128.24%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 8.64%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of the 16.94 in the Metals & Mining industry, Steel Dynamics Inc. has a lower P/E ratio of 16.89. Shareholders might be inclined to think that the stock might perform worse than its industry peers. It's also possible that the stock is undervalued. There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings."

Analysts work in banking and financial systems and typically specialize in reporting for stocks or defined sectors. Analysts may attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish analyst ratings for stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter. Analysts may suggest actions like buy, sell, hold, or similar verbage for each stock based on research compiled from the corresponding company. Analysts who suggest buy are telling traders to purchase the stock based on forecasted growth. On the flip side, analysts who suggest sell are telling traders to dump the stock because of a similarly forecasted decline. Analysts who suggest hold are telling investors that they see short-term or mid-term stagnation and to maintain their positions on the stock. Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders."

U.S. benchmark hot rolled coil spot prices recently reached near $1,700 per ton, about 2.5 times higher than their historical level. How To Play It: Tanners is projecting HRC steel prices will fall to an average of $1,075 in the second half of 2021 and all the way back down to $600 in 2022. “Our conviction of falling prices is supported by our Steelmageddon oversupply thesis, which was delayed to 2022E due to 2021’s COVID-inspired supply squeeze and some delayed capacity startups,” Tanners said. The analyst said steel stocks typically correct before steel prices do in past bubbles, making timing the trade very difficult. For now, she said investors need to be selective within the steel group. Her top stock picks include Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF), Reliance and Steel Dynamics. Benzinga’s Take: The VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX) is already up 38.3% year-to-date, so the excess cash flow Tanners is expecting in coming quarters may already be priced into the stocks to a large degree. The big question for steel stock investors is when steel prices start to pull back and how deep that pullback will be."
2021-07-07,Unusual Options Activity Insight: Steel Dynamics,"On Wednesday, shares of Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $61.21. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-07-16 Strike Price: $55.00 Volume: 94 Open Interest: 546 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-07-16,A Preview Of Steel Dynamics's Earnings,"Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) releases its next round of earnings this Monday, July 19. Here is Benzinga's essential guide to Steel Dynamics's Q2 earnings report. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Based on Steel Dynamics management projections, analysts predict EPS of $3.42 on revenue of $4.22 billion. Steel Dynamics EPS in the same period a year ago totaled $0.47. Sales were $2.09 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the consensus estimates. A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an earnings surprise and may move the stock by a considerable margin. If the company were to match the consensus estimate, earnings would be up 627.66%. Revenue would be up 101.53% on a year-over-year basis. In comparison to analyst estimates in the past, here is how the company's reported EPS stacks up: Quarter Q1 2021 Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 EPS Estimate 1.89 0.83 0.47 0.32 EPS Actual 2.10 0.97 0.51 0.47 Revenue Estimate 3.39 B 2.53 B 2.21 B 2.06 B Revenue Actual 3.54 B 2.60 B 2.33 B 2.09 B Stock Performance Shares of Steel Dynamics were trading at $61.62 as of July 15. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 131.27%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably satisfied going into this earnings release.

Revenue of $4,465,000,000 rose by 113.23% from the same period last year, which beat the estimate of $4,220,000,000. Outlook Steel Dynamics hasn't issued any earnings guidance for the time being.

It also processes and sells recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals and operates a steel fabrication business that manufactures products for the nonresidential construction industry."
2021-07-29,Return on Capital Employed Insights for Steel Dynamics,"After pulling data from Benzinga Pro it seems like during Q2, Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) earned $955.74 million, a 60.84% increase from the preceding quarter. Steel Dynamics also posted a total of $4.46 billion in sales, a 25.95% increase since Q1. Steel Dynamics earned $594.20 million, and sales totaled $3.54 billion in Q1. Why ROCE Is Significant Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in Steel Dynamics's Return on Capital Employed, a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q2, Steel Dynamics posted an ROCE of 0.19%. It is important to keep in mind ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but several factors could affect earnings and sales in the near future. Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. For Steel Dynamics, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies. Upcoming Earnings Estimate Steel Dynamics reported Q2 earnings per share at $3.4/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $3.42/share."
2021-08-09,Understanding Steel Dynamics's Unusual Options Activity,"Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) shares experienced unusual options activity on Monday. The stock price moved up to $63.31 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-08-20 Strike Price: $60.00 Volume: 580 Open Interest: 3795 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Why Insider Transactions Are Important? Insider transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however an insider transaction can be an important factor in the investing decision. In legal terms, an insider refers to any shareholder who owns at least 10% of a company. This can include executives in the c-suite and large hedge funds. These insiders are required to let the public know of their transactions via a Form 4 filing, which must be filed within two business days of the transaction. When a company insider makes a new purchase, that is an indication that they expect the stock to rise. Insider sells, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean that the seller thinks the stock will go down. Transaction Codes To Focus On Investors prefer focusing on transactions that take place in the open market, indicated in Table I of the Form 4 filing. A P in Box 3 indicates a purchase, while S indicates a sale. Transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option, and transaction code A indicates the insider may have been forced to sell shares in order to receive compensation that had been promised upon being hired by the company."

2022-01-19,Steel Dynamics: Debt Overview,"Shares of Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) moved lower by 10.90% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Steel Dynamics has. Steel Dynamics's Debt Based on Steel Dynamics's financial statement as of November 2, 2021, long-term debt is at $3.02 billion and current debt is at $88.60 million, amounting to $3.11 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.10 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $2.01 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Steel Dynamics's $11.54 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.27. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2022-01-24,Ominous Death Cross Forms On Steel Dynamics's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Steel Dynamics, which is trading around $51.38 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at Steel Dynamics's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q3 2021 Q2 2021 Q1 2021 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 4.57 3.42 1.89 0.83 EPS Actual 4.96 3.40 2.10 0.97 Revenue Estimate 4.98B 4.22B 3.39B 2.53B Revenue Actual 5.09B 4.46B 3.54B 2.60B Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2022-07-15,Will Strong Demand Drive Steel Dynamics' (STLD) Q2 Earnings?,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. STLD is set to release second-quarter 2022 results after the closing bell on Jul 20. Steel Dynamics' earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 2.5%, on average. The company posted an earnings surprise of 7.9% in the last reported quarter. Its second-quarter results will likely reflect the benefits of strong end-market demand. Shares of the company have gained 7% in the past year compared with 23.9% decline of the industry. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Zacks Model Our proven model predicts an earnings beat for Steel Dynamics this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earning beat. Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Steel Dynamics is +8.23%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is currently pegged at $5.68. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Steel Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. What do the Estimates Say? Steel Dynamics envisions second-quarter earnings in the range of $6.33-$6.37 per share, which suggests a record quarterly performance. Adjusted earnings have been forecast in the band of $6.61-$6.65 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for Steel Dynamics for the to-be-reported quarter is at $6,066 million, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 35.9%. The consensus estimate for average external product selling price for the company's steel operations is pegged at $1,471 per ton, indicating a year-over-year increase of 13.9%. The same for total external steel shipments stands at around 3.2 million tons, up around 9.7% year over year. A Few Factors to Watch The company's second-quarter results are likely to have benefited from demand strength across key markets. Strong demand across automotive, construction and industrial markets is expected to have aided its performance. Strength in the non-residential construction sector continues as reflected by strong order activities. Strong demand is expected to have driven its shipments in the to-be-reported quarter. Steel Dynamics, last month, said that it sees second-quarter profitability from steel operations to be historically strong but lower than first-quarter 2022 levels. The downside reflects lower earnings from the company's flat roll steel operations, as average flat roll pricing more than offset projected higher shipments. Strong demand for long product steel products supported higher average realized pricing in the quarter. The company witnessed solid overall steel demand during the second quarter, notwithstanding softening hot roll coil steel pricing. U.S. steel prices witnessed a significant downward correction during the second quarter. After surging to nearly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war, the benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices are on a downward trend and have retreated to levels before the conflict. HRC prices have fallen below the $1,000 per short ton level. The downward drift partly reflects shorter lead times. Mills are also negotiating lower prices for new orders. Fears of a recession have also impacted prices. Nevertheless, Steel Dynamics is expected to have benefited from higher year over year average selling prices in the June quarter. The impacts of higher selling prices are likely to reflect on its revenues and margins in the quarter. Steel Dynamics, Inc.

2023-01-27,A Look Into Basic Materials Sector Value Stocks,"What Defines a Value Stock? A value stock traditionally has a lower price when compared to stock prices of companies in the same industry. This indicates that the company may be undervalued, as investors are not expressing as much interest in such companies. The most commonly used way to check for value is with the price-to-earnings multiple, or P/E. A low P/E multiple is a good indication that the stock is undervalued. The following stocks are considered to be notable value stocks in the basic materials sector: Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD) - P/E: 5.37 Cemex (NYSE:CX) - P/E: 1.4 Nexa Res (NYSE:NEXA) - P/E: 7.45 Reliance Steel & Aluminum (NYSE:RS) - P/E: 7.45 Huntsman (NYSE:HUN) - P/E: 5.9 Steel Dynamics saw a decrease in earnings per share from 5.46 in Q3 to $4.37 now. Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 1.48%, which has decreased by 0.18% from last quarter's yield of 1.66%. Cemex looks to be undervalued. It possesses an EPS of $0.18, which has not changed since last quarter (Q2). Nexa Res's earnings per share for Q3 sits at $-0.37, whereas in Q2, they were at 0.61. Reliance Steel & Aluminum's earnings per share for Q3 sits at $6.48, whereas in Q2, they were at 9.15. The company's most recent dividend yield sits at 1.86%, which has decreased by 0.03% from 1.89% last quarter. Huntsman has reported Q3 earnings per share at $0.71, which has decreased by 44.53% compared to Q2, which was 1.28. Its most recent dividend yield is at 3.18%, which has increased by 0.23% from 2.95% in the previous quarter. The Significance: A value stock may need some time to rebound from its undervalued position. The risk of investing in a value stock is that this emergence may never materialize."

2023-04-20,Why Steel Dynamics Shares Are Soaring Today,"Steel Dynamics Inc (NASDAQ:STLD) shares are gaining around 8% today, following its mixed bag of first-quarter 2023 results. The company remains confident that market conditions are in place for solid domestic steel consumption. STLD reported Q1 revenues of $4.89 billion, down 12% Y/Y, missing the consensus of $5.00 billion. The company reported a record shipment of 3.3 million tons in Q1 versus 2.9 million tons a year ago. Operating income declined to $835.4 million in Q1 from $1.49 billion a year ago due to a significant Y/Y decline in operating income from Steel operations. Operating income from Steel operations was impacted by higher metal spread compression (up around $50 million) due to increased raw material costs, given the deployment of the remaining higher-priced pig iron ordered in early 2022 on the Ukraine and Russia supply-chain disruptions. Operating income from Steel Fabrication business rose to $551.3 million from $466.9 million a year ago on solid order entry from non-residential construction sector. Adjusted EPS of $4.01 came above the consensus of $3.52. Cash flow from operations stood at $733.8 million as of March 31, 2023. Steel Dynamics repurchased shares worth $354 million in Q1. The company witnessed operations ramp up at its newly started Sinton Flat Roll Steel Division and expects 2023 shipments to be around 80% of the plant's annual capacity. Order entry activity continues to be strong across all of our businesses. We believe North American steel consumption will increase in 2023, and that demand for lower-carbon emission, U.S. produced steel products coupled with lower imports will support steel pricing. We believe the automotive, non-residential construction, and energy sectors will remain solid steel consumers this year, said Mark D. Millett, Chairman and CEO. He further added, We are pleased to further diversify our end markets with plans to supply aluminum flat rolled products with high recycled content to the countercyclical sustainable beverage can industry, in addition to the automotive and industrial sectors. Price Action: STLD shares are trading higher by 7.97% at $114.69 on the last check Thursday."

2023-05-15,Retail Sales Preview: Will Consumer Demand Fall? How Markets Reacted To Prior Reports,"The Census Bureau is expected to publish U.S. retail sales data for April prior to the start of Tuesday's trading session. Here are five key takeaways for investors ahead of the report and analyst reactions to past releases. What Investors Need To Know Economists expect retail sales to rebound 0.7% month over month in April, after falling 0.6% in March. In annual terms, retail sales jumped 2.3% in March — the smallest surge since May 2020. Core retail sales (excluding automobiles) will likely increase 0.4% in April, rebounding from a 0.4% drop in March. Retail sales fell for the second consecutive month in March Increasing interest rates and cost concerns are weighing on consumers' propensity to spend. If retail sales fall in April, it would mark the third consecutive month of reductions. The last time three consecutive negative retail sales reports occurred was from August to October in 2015. How Did Markets React To Prior Retail Sales Reports? On April 14, preliminary retail sales for March delivered a 1% decline, then revised higher to a 0.6% drop, significantly lower than estimates of a 0.4% fall. Both the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSE:SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) fell 0.2% on that day.

Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC) outperformed as weaker-than-expected retail sales and troubles in US regional banks boosted expectations of lower Fed interest rates later in the year.

2023-06-12,A Bearish Sign Appears On Steel Dynamics's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Steel Dynamics, which is trading around $100.53 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at Steel Dynamics's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q1 2023 Q4 2022 Q3 2022 Q2 2022 EPS Estimate 3.52 3.79 5.02 6.34 EPS Actual 4.01 4.37 5.46 6.73 Revenue Estimate 5.00B 4.73B 5.44B 6.07B Revenue Actual 4.89B 4.83B 5.65B 6.21B Also consider this overview of Steel Dynamics analyst ratings: Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2023-06-16,Why Steel Dynamics Shares Are Sliding Today,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) shares are down Friday morning following its lackluster guidance for the second quarter 2023. The company expects second-quarter EPS of $4.78-$4.82, significantly lower than $6.44 a year ago. The Street view stands at $4.93. In the quarter to be reported, the company sees delays in some customer projects related to continued supply-chain constraints due to steel fabricators' extended backlogs, coupled with lack of construction materials and labor. Steel Dynamics expects metal margins to be lower than near-record first-quarter results. However, second-quarter profitability from the company's steel operations is expected to be significantly stronger than sequential first-quarter results. Steel order activity remains solid in the automotive, construction, industrial, and energy sectors. Second-quarter steel fabrication shipments are expected to be steady compared to the first quarter, partially offset by delays in some customer projects related to continued supply-chain constraints. Repurchase: The company repurchased $364 million, or 2%, of its common stock during the second quarter through June 9, 2023. Dividend: The company's second-quarter cash dividend of $0.425 per share is payable on or about July 14 to shareholders of record on June 30. Price Action: STLD shares are trading lower by 3.32% to $102.44 on the last check Friday."

2023-07-19,"Stocks Extend Gains, Dow Tops 35,000, Dollar Rebounds: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?","U.S. stocks are continuing their rally Wednesday, with the S&P 500 index on track for its seventh positive session in the last eight, reaching levels last seen in early April 2022. The Dow crossed the 35,000 milestone, on track for its fourth straight session of gains. Strong earnings remain the driving force behind the stock market, while investors eagerly await quarterly results from Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NYSE:UAL), all of which are scheduled to report after the closing bell. The market is now entering a light week in terms of macroeconomic releases, with only the S&P Global Flash PMI on Monday being in the spotlight before the pivotal event of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday, July 26. A lower-than-expected U.K. inflation rate, combined with increased speculation that the ECB may stop raising interest rates after July, created pressures in both the euro and the pound, fueling a rebound in the U.S. dollar index. Cues From Wednesday’s Trading: After officially entering a bull market on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to outperform other U.S. major averages on Wednesday, rising 0.4% for the day. The S&P 500 Index gained 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 inched 0.1% higher. Small caps in the Russell 2000 edged 0.2% higher.

The results on the surface probably won't offer much to write home about given consensus estimates imply a 7% year-over-year decline in S&P 500 earnings per share, said Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist, and Quincy Crosby, chief global strategist. “However, the key question is always what's priced in, which at least offers an opportunity for markets to react positively.” LPL's best guess, according to the analysts, is “typical upside surprises and guidance reductions,” giving this rally a convenient excuse to take a breather. Carson Group's Ryan Detrick, who is in the bullish camp, noted a historical trend that is positive for the market. The Russell 2,000 Index, comprising of small-cap stocks, had a gold cross technical move, i.e. the 50-day simple moving average crossing over above the longer-term 200-day moving average.

2023-09-25,"US Stocks See Modest Gains, Energy Outperforms, Bond Carnage Deepens: What's Driving Markets Monday?","In midday trading on Monday, U.S. stocks attempted a rebound following sharp losses experienced Friday. The bond market continued its downward spiral, with Treasury yields soaring to levels not seen in over a decade across maturities ranging from 10 to 30 years. The energy sector continued to outperform, driven by oil giants capitalizing on crude prices that have remained at or above $90 per barrel. The U.S. dollar surged to its highest point in the past 10 months, on track for its eleventh consecutive week of gains. This remarkable ascent has been propelled by the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance and deteriorating economic prospects in Europe. Cues From Monday’s Trading: The S&P 500 rose 0.4% on Monday, following a 1.6% decline on Friday and a nearly 3% drop last week. The Nasdaq 100 gained 0.4%, reacting after a 3.6% decline last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat for the day, while small caps in the Russell 2000 soared 0.6% after sinking 3.8% last week.

Technically, the S&P 500 has broken to the downside of a symmetrical triangle formation, Turnquist said. He flagged the sub-4,330 level as downside support in the 4,200-4,300 area, followed by the 200-day moving average at 4,189. Despite the recent pullback, there have been no major signs of a sustainable flight to safety, the analyst said. “Overall, we believe the market is down but not out,” he said. “Pullbacks are completely normal within the context of a bull market, and while the jump in rates is concerning, the S&P 500 remains in an uptrend, and above its rising 200-DMA.” Source: LPL Financial Monday’s Trading In Major US Equity ETFs The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.4% higher to $431.89.

Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders.

2023-10-16,"Tesla, Netflix Grab Earnings Spotlight This Week As Analysts Divided On Q3 Reporting Season: What's On Investors' Radar?","The third-quarter reporting season starts in earnest this week, with some high-profile names from the financial and tech spaces in the earnings mix. Mixed Expectations: S&P 500 earnings will likely increase for the first time in a year, according to FactSet. The blended year-over-year earnings growth for the S&P 500 companies is estimated at 0.4%, marking the first earnings growth for the index since the third quarter of 2022, the firm said in its weekly earnings insights released Friday. With 6% of the S&P 500 earnings in so far, 84% of them have reported positive earnings per share upside, while 66% turned in a positive revenue surprise, it added. LPL analysts Jeffrey Buchbinder and Quincy Krosby see “what has already been priced in” as the question in the mind of market participants. This offers an opportunity for the markets to react positively, they say. “Our best guess is we get the typical upside surprises and guidance reductions, giving this rally a convenient excuse to take a breather,” Buchbinder and Krosby said. The views were echoed by Commonwealth Financial Network analyst Ron Swanke. “While companies may be able to beat the easy expectations for the third quarter, the guidance they provide for the future will be key to supporting S&P 500 valuations, which are still slightly above their long-term averages,” the analyst said. Swanke said he will pay close attention to profit margins in the third quarter and beyond, as companies will likely find it more difficult to pass on cost increases to consumers amid rising interest rates, tight job market, and the continued cooling off of inflationary pressure. The analyst expects net profit margins to fall from 11.9% a year ago to 11.7% in the third quarter. The key to achieving the 8.2% earnings per growth expected for the fourth quarter and 12.2% growth forecast for 2024 is whether companies can maintain high margins, he said, adding that revenue growth will likely be muted at 4.6% in the fourth quarter and 5.5% in 2024.

2023-10-18,"Stocks Dip As Yields Hit 5%, Oil Soars Amid Middle East Turmoil: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?","Wall Street tumbled during midday trading, with all major stock indices in the red, and only the energy sector showing gains for the session, while 30-year Treasury yields breached the 5% mark, hitting the highest level in over 17 years. The recent developments in the Middle East have weighed on risk sentiment after President Joe Biden defended Israel and condemned the ‘other team’ for the attack on the Gaza’s hospital on Tuesday which caused over 500 casualties. The president also pledged “unprecedented package support” for Israel to be approved by Congress as early as this week. Tech heavyweights, such as Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will report their third-quarter earnings after the market close. Meanwhile, Iran’s threat to impose an oil embargo on Israel has reignited a rally in oil prices, with the WTI benchmark up 1.2%. This surge was further propelled by a larger-than-predicted draw in U.S. crude oil inventories last week, with a decrease of 4.491 million barrels compared to the expected 0.3 million. Cues From Wednesday’s Trading Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 fell 1%, while blue chip stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.7%. Small caps suffered substantially, with the Russell 2000 index down 1.7%.

For calendar year 2023, the analyst models essentially flat EPS of about $220.00 for the S&P 500 Index. Comerica’s preliminary 2024 S&P 500 EPS projection of $237.50 is about $10 less than the consensus forecast, Lynch said. “Of course, the combination of liquidity and hopes for an easing of Fed policy can play a role in valuation,” he added.
