2018-01-22,What You Need To Know About TD Ameritrade's 24-Hour Trading,"TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:AMTD) continued to press all-time highs Monday after announcing it would become the first U.S. retail broker to enable 24-hour trading. The offering supports the 70 percent of TD Ameritrade clients known to research trades during off-hours, and it allows immediate reaction to overnight news, such as federal government shutdown or global elections. “Very frequently, they’re making investment and trading decisions, but they have to wait until the next day to put that order into the market,” Steve Quirk, executive vice president of Trading and Education at TD Ameritrade, told Benzinga. The 24-hour capabilities also appease an expanding client base in Asia. “With a 14-hour time difference, during their waking hours, they’re very limited in what they can trade, and they have a very large appetite to trade U.S. equities,” Quirk said. “This gives them the ability to do so.” Quirk said the goal of the innovation isn’t to poach market share from rival retail brokers, but rather to answer the demands of existing customers who want to compete with institutional players. “We’re on a constant quest to level the playing field, and this would be another step in that journey,” he said. In the off-hours between 8 p.m. EST Sunday and 8 p.m. EST Friday, investors on the Thinkorswim or mobile platforms can trade 12 exchange-traded funds: iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index (ETF) (NYSE:FXI) SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Indx (ETF) (NYSE:EEM) SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD) iShares Silver Trust (ETF) (NYSE:SLV) SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (NYSE:UNG) iShares Barclays 20+ Yr Treas.Bond (ETF) (NASDAQ:TLT) iShares Russell 2000 Index (ETF) (NYSE:IWM) PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ:QQQ) United States Oil Fund LP (ETF) (NYSE:USO) ProShares Short S&P500 (ETF) (NYSE:SH) Quirk said more tickers could be added as volume ramps up and the marketplace becomes more robust. “It’s always our primary concern to make sure that we make it a good experience for people before we start expanding on it,” he said. In its announcement, TD Ameritrade warned that extended-hour trading is subject to unique conditions, including lower liquidity and higher volatility. The service makes trading undoubtedly more expedient, although not necessarily more profitable. “I don’t know that I would say that they are going to make any more money,” Quirk said. “I would just say it’s going to make it more convenient for them. For us and for our clients, it’s more just knocking down one more barrier that says it’s an electronic marketplace.” At time of publication, TD Ameritrade's stock was up nearly 1 percent at $55.64.

2018-02-01,This Gold Mining CEO Thinks Cryptos And Gold Are Both 'Here To Stay',"The cryptocurrency craze has been likened to a gold rush mentality, but some see a relationship beyond the comparison. “The mania in the cryptocurrencies out there has definitely taken some of the speculative fervor out of the junior gold exploration companies, where these things have incredible runs on bull and bear market cycles,” US Gold Corp (NASDAQ:USAU) CEO Edward Karr told Benzinga. But Karr’s outlook on both assets is curiously consistent: “I think both are here to stay.” The Merits Of Cryptos For a gold guy, Karr speaks fairly thoughtfully of the ostensible enemy. “Cryptos have had this incredible rise over the last couple years,” he said. “Last year was just amazing. The younger generation, the 25- to 30-year-old millennials, they’re all very comfortable with cryptos, they like trading them and they see still very big potential upside.” He does anticipate the hype will dissipate, though. It's really interesting for the short-term phenomenon, but there’s definitely a speculative amount to it,” Karr said. “Like what we went through with the dot-com bubble going into the late 1990s ... probably the cryptocurrencies will have a little bit of a wash-out.” The Defense For Gold Cryptocurrency's stature isn’t seen to diminish the appeal of gold. As Karr sees it, the tangible asset has withstood the test of time both in substance and in value. An ounce of gold in the Roman Empire bought a custom-made suit of high-quality chainmail just as an ounce of gold today, at $1,350, buys a custom-made suit of high-quality fabric. “Over 2,500 years, that one ounce of gold gets you the same custom suit,” Karr said. “You can’t really say that yet for cryptocurrencies.” At the same time, Karr said the shiny brick will endure economic cycles, wars, geopolitical crises, computer crashes and grid failures, while the incipient cryptocurrencies haven’t yet proven their staying power. His confidence in gold echoes that of Goldman Sachs, which assured that the limited, unhackable resource is and will remain a relevant asset class in spite of cryptocurrency trends and its own lack of yield.

2018-02-05,Gold Miners Celebrate A Weakening Dollar: 'Inflation Is Coming',"The U.S. dollar continued its 2017 decline through the first month of the new year, and some expect no immediate relief. The trend is welcomed by US Gold Corp (NASDAQ:USAU) CEO Edward Karr. “It should be a really good year for gold,” Karr told Benzinga in a recent interview. “I think gold’s going to go higher.” Why The Correlation? Historically, commodities have risen with inflation. As equity markets weaken, investors diversify into “safe havens” like gold, the value of which remains globally steady. “Gold has been a good long-term inflation hedge, and as the dollar declines, inflation will increase, especially through energy input costs because the price of oil becomes more expensive,” Karr said. “ ... I think inflation is coming.” What Affects The Dollar? The dollar’s value is relative to those of competitors, so strength in global currencies reduces the power of the dollar. Some economists attribute recent weakness to growth, particularly in Asian economies. The Federal Reserve can also drive a value change. Increasing interest rates incentivizes saving or bond investing, which causes deflation and increases the dollar’s value. Lowering interest rates triggers spending and economic growth, which causes inflation, reduces the dollar’s value and increases the appeal of non-yield-bearing assets like gold. A New Gold-Dollar Relationship Citigroup analysts recently argued the inverse correlation between commodities and the dollar has dissipated. “Commodity prices have traded in a strong inverse relationship with the U.S. dollar over the past decade or so, but this relationship broke down in late 2016 and the breakdown looks here to stay, the Citi analysts said. Merrill Lynch recently acknowledged the trend but said the correlation between commodities and the dollar remains. It's absolutely true that even though in the course of 2017 the correlation between oil commodities generally, and the dollar, has weakened, it is still a very very big driver,” Sabine Schels, head of fundamental commodities research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told CNBC. “And the causality really goes from the dollar to commodity prices.” Related Links: Where Experts Stand On Bitcoin After 40% Plunge This Gold Mining CEO Thinks Cryptos And Gold Are Both 'Here To Stay'"
2018-02-06,"When Markets Crash, What Do People Google?","The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) are recovering from 7.7-percent and 6.2-percent dips. The market moved down quickly over the last few sessions, leaving many on the Street surprised. People are waking up shocked — January was a very good month and suddenly you hit February and it’s all flipped, Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told Bloomberg. Craig said his email inbox flooded with clients asking what on Earth has happened? But concern seems slow to settle in. Early Tuesday, the world had more pressing inquiries about SpaceX and Oprah Winfrey, according to Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s Google Trends. Financial market terms like “S&P 500 Index” and “Dow Jones Industrial Average” started the day with third-place rankings in the search engine’s most popular queries until late morning, when they rose to No. 1. “VIX” has claimed peak traffic since August as iPath S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures TM ETN (NYSE:VXX) faded off an 88.2-percent spike. Volatility” fielded average interest for the year. Here's how global traffic on other relevant terms has changed as the markets shake: “Stock market” struck its highest traffic since the 2016 election. All preceding periods within the last year registered less than 75 percent of the interest seen in recent days. “Bitcoin” saw 38 percent of its peak mid-December popularity. Despite the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD)’s sharp sell-off, “gold” searches were relatively consistent with year-over-year traffic and marginally lower than the time of most intense interest at the end of December. Throughout the day, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange and Federal Reserve were also trending.

2018-02-07,"The Overlooked Relationship Between Gold And Bitcoin, Explained","Bitcoin bulls have long argued the cryptocurrency is a new store of value for investors thanks to its protection from inflation and its deregulated nature. In fact, even some bitcoin analysts have compared the currency to gold. Historically, there has been no clear indication of any correlation between bitcoin and gold prices, but UBS now says a very weak correlation has started to emerge. The surprising part about analyst Chris Louney’s findings is that the correlation is actually negative. “Toward the end of last year, we started to notice that correlation turned at least mildly negative,” Louney said on CNBC. “When we saw interest in bitcoin peak as measured by Google trends, that's really when we saw this marginal negative relationship between gold and bitcoin develop.” Flight From Safety? An inverse correlation suggests bitcoin prices tend to rise when gold prices fall and vice versa. So far in 2018, the most popular bitcoin fund, the Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC:GBTC) is down 38.4 percent. The most popular gold investment fund, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD), is up 1.1 percent. Standpoint Research analyst Ronnie Moas says bitcoin is a legitimate alternative to gold and could eventually compete with the $7 trillion value of the global gold supply. “An argument can be made that Bitcoin will be equal to Gold within 10-15 years,” Moas said in November. Standpoint has a $28,000 price target for bitcoin. Gold Is The Dependable Choice Other experts argue that bitcoin will never compete with gold on a large scale. The extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency market makes it too much of a risk for “flight to safety” investors. The past week, at least, suggest there’s very little safety in bitcoin at all. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) tumbled 3.3 percent in the past week, but the price of bitcoin crashed 20.5 percent in that time. US Gold Corp (NASDAQ:USAU) CEO Edward Karr recently told Benzinga gold has an unparalleled history of reliability for investors that cryptocurrencies can’t come close to matching. “Over 2,500 years, that one ounce of gold gets you the same custom suit,” Karr said. “You can’t really say that yet for cryptocurrencies.” Related Links: 12 Cryptocurrencies To Watch In 2018 (Besides Bitcoin) Mark Yusko Explains 'The Miracle Of Bitcoin'"
2018-02-08,State Street Strategist: Every Portfolio Can Benefit From Gold,"Gold prices tend to move lower at the early stages of a stock market sell-off, according to one gold expert. The Expert George Milling-Stanley, head of State Street Global Advisors' gold strategy. The Thesis When faced with the prospect of margin calls, many investors and traders aren't interested in selling their stock positions at depleted levels, Milling-Stanley said during CNBC's Worldwide Exchange. Investors are instead turning to gold, or the thing that comes in useful when other things go down, Milling-Stanley said. Gold does its job, which implies investors will return to buy it back — so the current weakness in gold and gold-related products like the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD) is likely to reverse, he said. While there never is a bad time to be buying gold, now is certainly a perfect to be buyers of the commodity, he said. The pressure in gold has been to the upside, which creates an ideal scenario for investors, Milling-Stanley said. Every portfolio would benefit from a small strategic allocation to gold, and I don't think that the particular entry point is necessarily the thing to focus on. Some experts are saying there is a relationship between bitcoin and gold, but Milling-Stanley said he isn't seeing any evidence of that. Gold is among the least-volatile instruments, but bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have proven to be exponentially bigger, which implies none of the cryptocurrencies are serious competitors to gold, he said. Price Actione Shares of the Gold Trust ETF were up 0.29 percent to $125.15 at the time of publication Thursday afternoon.

2018-02-09,One Crazy Week In The Stock Market,"U.S. stocks had another volatile day of trading Friday, capping off one of the wildest weeks for the market in years. The S&P 500 and the Dow made a huge comeback Friday afternoon, but the indices still experience their most volatile week since October 2008. Once the dust settled on the week, the Dow had traveled more than 20,000 points, according to CNBC. The Dow closed Friday around 24,100 and the S&P 500 closed around 2,619. Know What You Own The consensus opinion among market experts is that investors shouldn’t panic after being blindsided by the sell-off. “The economy is doing better now than it has any time in the past decade,” Bankrate.com Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride said Thursday. “This is just some healthy, and overdue, volatility to wring out any excess.” Unfortunately, Stifel chief economist Lindsey Piegza said “stay calm” doesn’t provide much comfort for investors who took huge hits this week. “From a longer-term view, or arguably a more level-headed perspective, advisors recommend knowing what you own and the reasons behind it, period,” Piegza said. Related Link: Correction Territory: Putting It Into Perspective Inverse Volatility Loop So where were all the selling pressure and wild market swings coming from? Inverse volatility funds, including the Credit Suisse AG – VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN (NYSE:XIV) and the ProShares Trust II (NYSE:SVZY), have taken much of the blame for the historical spike in stock market volatility this week. These inverse volatility ETNs are designed to be reverse-levered to the VIX volatility index. This leverage creates a unique situation where the assets under management of the funds decrease as the VIX rises. As the value of the VIX contracts being shorted increases, the fund also becomes “more short” the VIX, a phenomenon that must be offset by reducing short holdings, which once again involves buying underlying VIX futures contracts. “This buying pushes the volatility higher still, reducing AUM further, and making the issuer's hedging portfolio notionally more short, inducing further VIX futures buying to resize the portfolio to shrinking AUM,” Bernstein analyst Noah Weisberger said Thursday. In fact, things got so far out of control during Monday's after-hours trading session that the XIV dropped 80 percent from its previous day’s close, triggering an “acceleration event” that prompted Credit Suisse to liquidate the fund. Rising Bond Yields The other major culprit this week was rising bond yields. The bond market has definitely got the stock market's attention, said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. Is the bond market telling us something we don't know? Is there more inflation down the road than we're expecting? Gorilla Trades strategist Ken Berman said the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates so low for so long that it has created some imbalances in the market. “The tough part of this market decline is that it has occurred against the backdrop of a strong government jobs report on Friday, which showed 200,000 new jobs,” Burns said Friday. Silver Linings Despite the major sell-off, there were still some silver linings for traders this week. Dennis Dick, co-host of PreMarket Prep, said traders using the right strategies made a lot of money this week. Days of extreme volatility often create short-term divergence among highly correlated stocks, Dick said. “These are your best days as relationship traders, because they're throwing everything everywhere,” Dick said. Brokers also had a great week. “Friday [Feb. 2] was the second busiest trading day in Fidelity’s history, and Monday was THE busiest trading day ever,” Robert Beauregard, director of public relations at Fidelity Investments, told Benzinga in an email. Robinhood and TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (NYSE:AMTD) also had big weeks.

2018-02-15,Can Bitcoin Be Used As A Safe Haven During Stock Market Volatility?,"Bitcoin bulls arguing that the popular cryptocurrency could surpass gold as a flight to safety investment have gotten some discouraging market feedback in the past several weeks. When the S&P 500 experienced its largest sell-off in years this month, it coincided with bitcoin’s lowest price dip in months, indicating investors don’t yet see cryptocurrency as a safe way to preserve value. A longer-term picture of the correlation between the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and the Bitcoin investment Trust (OTC:GBTC), however, suggests if volatility ever dies down in the cryptocurrency market, bitcoin might emerge as a compelling flight to safety investment. The Good News For Bitcoin Bulls Here’s a look at the Portfolio Visualizer daily return correlation matrix for the SPY, the GBTC, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD), the United States Oil Fund LP (ETF) (NYSE:USO), the iShares Barclays 20+ Yr Treas.Bond (ETF) (NASDAQ:TLT) and the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures TM ETN (NYSE:VXX). The correlations are calculated based on daily returns since May of 2015. Low Correlation With Other Asset Classes The numbers suggest that the GBTC bitcoin fund does have a relatively low 0.07 correlation with the SPY ETF. In fact, the GBTC ETF has even less of a correlation to stocks than the GLD ETF, which has a negative 0.19 correlation. The negative correlation likely comes in part by the fact that investors tend to buy gold on days of market weakness. Those arguing for bitcoin being its own asset class would point to the fact that the GBTC has very low correlation to stocks, gold, oil, treasury bonds or even market volatility, according to the table. Internal Volatility Is The Problem Unfortunately, there’s one key component of a safe haven investment that bitcoin is sorely lacking—stability. Traders use a metric called average true range (ATR) to determine daily asset volatility. Over the past 14 days (as of Feb. 13), amid all the stock market turmoil, the ATR of the SPY ETF as a percentage of its trading price has been about 1.7 percent, according to Stockcharts.com. In that same period, the ATR of the GLD as a percentage of its share price has been a relatively stable 0.8 percent. The ATR of the GBTC as a percentage of its share price, however, has been an incredibly volatile 14.2 percent. With a volatility that high, investors simply can’t feel safe in bitcoin-related investments in the near-term, even if the cryptocurrency has near zero correlation with stock prices. For now, bitcoin traders can feel good knowing that the stock market doesn’t appear to be influencing bitcoin prices in any major way. But stock investors will likely stick to the relative stability of gold and other traditional safe-haven plays until the cryptocurrency market settles down.

2018-02-19,The Luster On Gold ETFs Is Still Intact,"Major gold-backed exchange traded products, such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), are sporting solid year-to-date showings. Some market observers, however, are voicing concerns about the yellow metal after it declined during the volatility spike earlier this month. Gold's lack of positive response to the surge in the CBOE Volatility Index, also known as the VIX, vexed investors and led some to question the precious metal's safe-haven status. “With the CBOE Volatility Index reaching as high as 37 over the last two weeks, a level not seen since August 2015, it was agreed upon that fear had reentered the market,” said CFRA Research analyst Lindsey Bell in a note last week. “However, the price of gold, which is often considered a safe haven asset in times of uncertainty, declined just over 3 percent from its recent high on Jan. 25 through last Friday.” Remaining Steady Although gold disappointed a bit earlier this month, GLD and IAU are still up 3.5 percent this year and spot gold prices have remained above the technically important $1,300 per ounce level. “There are several outside factors that affect the direction of gold, which has steadily remained above the $1300 level since the start of 2018,” said Bell. “In actuality, the VIX has a low correlation to the direction of gold. The dollar on the other hand, has a significant correlation with gold prices. Inflation and interest rates also have an impact. The US Dollar Index is currently about 7 percent lower than its average price in 2017, while gold has appreciated by 5 percent over its average price in 2017.” The PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSE:UUP), which tracks the dollar's performance against the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc, is down 3.1 percent this year. An Inflation Hedge Rising inflation could be a catalyst for GLD, IAU and rival gold ETFs because the yellow metal is historically a favored hedge against rising consumer prices. “Gold has a negative correlation of 48 with the dollar, explaining the opposite moves. Inflation has a negative 17 correlation and the Federal Funds rate has a negative correlation of 57,” said Bell. “In other words, most simply put, the best environment to own gold is one in which the dollar, inflation and interest rates are declining.” “The January reading on consumer prices released on Wednesday showed prices rose more than expected, up 0.5 percent versus the 0.3 percent expectation,” reports Reuters. “The core reading rose 0.3 percent against the 0.2 percent forecast. Both numbers increased from the 0.2 percent reading for December.” Related Links: A Dividend Surprise in This ETF Vanguard Gets Active With New Factor ETFs Disclosure: The author owns shares of IAU."
2018-03-09,Jobs Report Blows Expectations Out Of The Water,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics released employment data for the month of February, and the jobs report blew expectations out of the water. Here’s a rundown of everything you need to know. What You need To Know The nonfarm payroll number came in at +313,000, and the private payroll number was +287,000. Both numbers were blowouts, topping consensus economist expectations of +205,000 and +195,000, respectively. The unemployment rate remained at 4.1 percent, missing the consensus target of 4.0 percent. The so-called “real” unemployment rate, which factors in those out of the workforce and those who are underemployed, remained steady at 8.2 percent. Manufacturing payrolls were up 31,000, well above the consensus target of 17,000. The construction industry added the most jobs of any industry on the month, adding 61,000 new positions. Wages increased just 0.1 percent month-over-month in February, missing the consensus target of 0.2 percent. Wages are up 2.6 percent in the past year. Markets React Investors breathed a sigh of relief following Friday’s report, as the numbers suggest the economy is on firm footing but inflation seems to be in check for now. Fears over ramping inflation sent the Dow tumbling 666 points on the day of the January employment data release. Investors seem to believe the February numbers will keep the Fed on track to raise interest rates slowly and steadily. Expert Take Bankrate senior economic analyst Mark Hamrick said there was both good news and bad news on the wages front. The gain in average hourly earnings of 2.6% over the past year is less-than-stellar for workers, but also helps to calm inflation fears, Hamrick said. Having said that, if we see the February payrolls number sustained, which seems unlikely, that keeps the inflation question very much in play. Hamrick said the Fed now has the green light for a March rate hike. Barring the truly unforeseen between now and then, the Federal Reserve remains set to raise interest rates at this month’s meeting, he said. Once we get past that initial likely announcement, more important are the signals about the future trajectory of interest rates. RSM chief economist Joseph Brusuelas said lackluster wage growth may not be enough to deter the Fed from a foourth rate hike in 2018 The 313,000 job gain is more than triple that necessary to meet the demand of new entrants into the work force, which if it sustained will continue to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate, Brusuelas said. This will not be lost among a FOMC that leans hawkish in 2018 and points towards an increasing probability that the central bank will hike rates four times this year. Price Action Here’s a look at the market’s initial reaction to the report: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was up 0.5 percent. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD) was down 0.4 percent. The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures TM ETN (NYSE:VXX) was down 1.6 percent. The ProShares Trust Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF (NYSE:UVXY) was down 2.7 percent. The Credit Suisse AG VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term ETN (NASDAQ:TVIX) was down 3.5 percent.

2018-03-13,Rex Tillerson Out As Secretary Of State; CIA Director Mike Pompeo To Fill Role,"The list of notable departures from the White House grew Tuesday after President Donald Trump ousted Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, as first reported by The Washington Post. What Happened Trump asked Tillerson to resign from his post last week. CIA Director Mike Pompeo will assume the title of Secretary of State and Gina Haspel, the deputy director of the CIA, will become the first woman to lead the spy agency in its history. I want to thank Rex Tillerson for his service, Trump was quoted as saying in a statement. A great deal has been accomplished over the last fourteen months, and I wish him and his family well. Why It's Important Trump, according to The Post, believes the former ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) CEO was too establishment in his thinking and a new diplomat with a background in running the CIA may be a prudent move. Specifically, the White House appears to be gearing up for direct talks with North Korea's regime and Pompeo may be better suited to advise the President compared to Tillerson. Mike [Pompeo] graduated first in his class at West Point, served with distinction in the U.S. Army, and graduated with Honors from Harvard Law School, Trump said. He went on to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives with a proven record of working across the aisle. On Monday, Tillerson said he agreed with Britain’s assessment that Russia was “likely responsible” for the poisoning in England of a Russian double agent and his daughter. What's Next It's not immediately clear what the next step for the White House would be or what changes in foreign policy will happen from the change which caught many off guard. According to AP's State Department correspondent Josh Lederman, there was zero indication early Tuesday morning that Tillerson's ouster was imminent. The Secretary did not speak to the President and is unaware of the reason, but he is grateful for the opportunity to serve, said State Department Under Secretary Steve Goldstein.

2018-03-14,Rethinking The Bitcoin-Gold Comparison,"Digital currencies are a rapidly growing asset class and bitcoin is the primary driver of that growth. Bitcoin has been compared to gold during its meteoric rise, but some market participants believe the cryptocurrency has a long way to go before comparisons to bullion are relevant. One of the obvious sticking points comes from the world of exchange traded funds. U.S. regulators have yet to approve ETFs related to bitcoin — or any cryptocurrencies for that matter. Earlier this year, the Securities and Exchange Commission forced several ETF sponsors to scuttle applications for bitcoin-related ETFs. On the other hand, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), is the 20th-largest U.S.-listed ETF and has $35.4 billion in assets under management. The iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) is home to $11.2 billion in assets. There's an age factor as well: bitcoin has only been part of the investment lexicon since 2009. By some estimates, gold has been part of human history for 6,000 years. A Long Road Ahead Gold has a lengthy head start on digital currencies when it comes to relevancy in the international monetary system. On a large scale, gold is bought and sold by many of the world's largest central banks. Bullion is also a favored asset among many retail investors who are looking for ways to diversify portfolios away from bonds and equities or those looking to guard against inflation. Bitcoin has yet to develop a significant reputation on those fronts. “Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency developed and it only emerged on the scene as recently as 2009,” said George Milling-Stanley, head of gold strategy at State Street Global Advisors in a Tuesday note. “Until bitcoin has demonstrated over time that it can effectively transfer and preserve wealth, I don’t think it’s responsible to call it Gold 2.0.” SSgA, the third-largest U.S. ETF issuer, markets GLD. Concerns And Similarities Cryptocurrencies are volatile, making the asset class difficult to deploy in portfolios for many advisors and investors. Not only are digital currencies speculative, but the accessibility of cryptos is difficult for many investors relative to ETFs such as GLD and IAU. Yet there are similarities shared by bitcoin and gold. For example, neither is controlled by a central bank in the way the dollar is supposedly controlled by the Federal Reserve. “The other similarity is scarce supply. Bitcoin is engineered to slowly decline to zero growth around the year 2140, where it will reach maximum capacity of 21 million digital coins,” said Milling-Stanley. “Gold doesn’t have a set date or maximum capacity, but on average approximately 3,200 tonnes of gold have been mined every year, adding about 1.7 percent of the total stock of gold ever mined.” Related Links: A Convincing Commodities ETF Young, But Strong ETFs Disclosure: The author owns shares of IAU."
2018-03-21,"Federal Reserve Hikes Interest Rates, Sees 3 More Hikes Coming In 2018","Federal Reserve officials met for the first time under new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell this week. What Happened The Fed raised the benchmark interest rate by one-quarter of a point to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. The discount rate was raised from 2 percent to 2.25 percent. The Fed sees three rate increases this year, three next year and two in 2020. Fed officials project 2-percent GDP growth In 2020. Why It's Important Based on the data inside the summary of economic projections and the dot plot forecast, investors and firm mangers should anticipate a fourth rate hike added to the scoreboard at the June 2018 FOMC meeting, said RMS Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas. The committee acknowledged the improvement in the outlook on growth by boosting its forecast to 2.7 percent for the year and bringing its forecast on the unemployment [rate] to 3.8 percent in the summary of economic projections, both of which imply upside risk linked to the impact of the Trump tax cuts and the roughly $320 billion in spending via the two-year budget agreement passed earlier in the year. A 10-year rate at 2.91 percent is seriously mispriced given the Fed’s dot plot forecast, Brusuelas said. Either the market does not believe the Fed and will pay a price, or the Fed is seriously overestimating the underlying strength in the economy. Either way, the volatility in the fixed income market is about to get very interesting. What's Next S&P 500 futures ticked higher about 6 points heading into the Fed release and remained higher after it was released. The bottom line ... is that the economy is strong enough to absorb the rate hikes amidst a tight labor market and a modest acceleration in inflation, Brusuelas said. The likelihood of strong wage growth and an increase in overall economic activity linked to a late-cycle fiscal boost from the federal government should broaden the distribution of economic benefits in a manner that was not apparent early in the business cycle.

2018-03-22,"Trump's $60B Tariff Plan Rattles Markets, Chinese Tech Stocks","President Donald Trump implemented a new round of tariffs on imported Chinese goods. What Happened The Trump administration is imposing up to $60 billion of new tariffs on imported Chinese goods in response to the U.S. trade deficit with China. Trump also accused China of stealing U.S. intellectual property. The new tariffs are focused mostly on technology-related goods, but the full list of specifically-targeted goods won't be released for another two weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down nearly 500 points (1.9 percent) less than an hour before Thursday's close, while the S&P 500 was down about 40 points (1.4 percent). Why It’s Important The latest tariffs on Chinese goods come after Trump already imposed tariffs on imported steel, aluminum and solar panels earlier this year. Investors are increasingly concerned these isolationist policies will trigger retaliation from China and even an all-out trade war. American companies that rely on international sales could be hit particularly hard by such a trade war. Trump isn’t afraid of China’s potential retaliation and has previously said trade wars are “easy to win.” Height Capital Markets analyst Clayton Allen said the new measures are simply intended to create negotiating leverage for the U.S. “It’s the next step in a continuing process to push forward the stalled negotiations with the Chinese,” Allen said in a research note. “Trump wants to make quite a show of it, and his goal is to gain negotiating leverage with the Chinese.” What’s Next Investors will be watching closely to see which products will be targeted in the new tariffs and how China will react. Trade experts expect China to focus on U.S. agricultural exports if it chooses to retaliate. In addition, investors will be keeping a close eye on how a potential trade war escalates in coming weeks. Here’s how the market reacted to Thursday’s news: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was down 1.7 percent; The SPDR Gold rust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD) was down 0.5 percent; The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures TM ETN (NYSE:VXX) was up 9.3 percent; The PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE:UUP) was up 0.2 percent; and The Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC:GBTC) was down 3.9 percent. Several Chinese technology stocks were also hit: Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA) fell nearly 5 percent; JD.Com Inc(ADR) (NASDAQ:JD) fell 2.3 percent; Vipshop Holdings Ltd - ADR (NYSE:VIPS) fell 8.8 percent; and Baidu Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU) fell 4.7 percent.

2018-03-27,Investing Basics: How To Reduce Tail Risk In A Diversified Portfolio,"When building a portfolio, retail investors typically seek to generate the highest possible return at a certain desired risk level. More often than not, people try achieve this by acquiring diverse stocks from companies with varied market capitalizations that operate in different economic sectors. Sometimes, bold investors also diversify geographically, placing some bets on European, Asian or Latin American stocks. For their part, risk-averse investors often go for bonds, fixed-income mutual funds and other safe harbor investments. Diversify None of these strategies are truly diversified: when the markets sell off, they can all go down together, said Don Steinbrugge, Managing Partner at Agecroft Partners. “A portfolio comprised by 60 percent equities and 40 percent bonds is not really diversified. Institutional investors get a little bit more sophisticated in building out their asset allocation. So, most large pension funds or endowment funds will try to create an asset allocation with a high risk-adjusted returns,” he told Benzinga. In the process of constructing a strong portfolio, investment advisors consider three items, Steinbrugge said: The returns different sectors of the equity and fixed-income markets offer, assessing valuations. The risks associated with different investments, as measured by volatility or the standard deviation of returns over time. How these factors move in relation to one another, expressed as market correlation. Once these factors are determined, software can unravel what the optimal asset mix, Steinbrugge said: What will give you the highest return for the desired level of risk? This strategy tends to generate strong returns until there is a major sell-off. Returns are suddenly and unexpectedly negative; volatility increases substantially; and correlations tend to rise, meaning that asset classes investors expected to move in different directions start moving in the same direction. Tail Risk The worst-case scenario is when all three vents occur simultaneously, causing a portfolio to decline significantly more than expected, Steinbrugge said. “This tail risk is what we saw in 2008.” It's fundamental to understand what the tail risk in a portfolio looks like. You don’t want to have to sell when everything else has already sold off,” Steinbrugge said. “The key to a strong portfolio is being able to ride out any major, prolonged market selloff.” But, how can investors reduce tail risk? There are a couple of methods, Steinbrugge said: Build a more conservative portfolio. Create a portfolio with diverse strategies to ensure correlations don’t surge when markets sell off; some of these are CTAs, direct lending, market neutral equity strategies, volatility arbitrage and reinsurance.

2018-04-02,"April, Come She Will? Markets Kick Off Q2 On A Rough Note","After snapping a nine-quarter winning streak in the first quarter of 2018, U.S. stocks stumbled out of the gate in the second quarter as well on Monday. The Dow plummeted 458 points to close at 23,644.19, down 1.9 percent. The S&P 500 closed at 2,579.27, down 2.3 percent. The index closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 27, 2016. The Nasdaq fell 2.7 percent and entered correction territory, closing at 6,870.12 Investors seem increasingly concerned that politics will bring an abrupt end to the nine-year market rally. President Trump once again attacked Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) on Monday. In recent years, Trump has slammed Amazon for its U.S. Postal Service subsidies and what he says is preferential tax treatment. Amazon and its FANG brethren have been the market leaders throughout most of the nine-year rally. FANG stocks Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are dealing with their own problems with Washington, as investors fear regulators may soon crash down on the two advertising giants’ use of customer data following Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal. Trade War Fears Linger Following Trump’s recent series of tariffs on imported Chinese goods, China has demonstrated it's not afraid of a trade war, slapping its own tariffs on 128 different U.S. products. Investors of U.S. companies that do business overseas are now uneasy about the impacts of a potential trade war. On Monday, Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Wilson said U.S. stocks are a great value following the sell-off. “We think many of the risks that have rattled markets of late (inflationary fears, Fed, rolling economic surprise indices, trade concerns, fears of potential regulatory backlash to internet stock leaders, a flattening curve, and rising vol) have been priced fairly and we could see a modest rerating as fundamentals come through in earnings season,” he said. Price Action Clearly, investors are not yet convinced the dip is a buying opportunity. Here’s a look at how the market finished a volatile Monday: The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was down 2.1 percent. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was down 2.1 percent. The PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ:QQQ) was down 2.7 percent. The iShares Russell 2000 Index (ETF) (NYSE:IWM) was down 2.1 percent.

2018-04-04,13 Stocks And ETFs To Watch Amid China's 25% Tariff Threat,"China has responded to the latest round of U.S. tariffs by announcing its own set of 25 percent tariffs on 105 categories of U.S. exports, including soybeans, airplanes and automobiles. The news sent the S&P 500 and Dow Jones falling on Wednesday, and Height Capital Markets analyst Clayton Allen said investors were likely not the only ones caught off guard by China’s strong response. “We believe that China's response to President Trump's proposed list of tariffs was more rapid and substantive than Trump expected, leaving the president in a less favorable negotiating position,” Allen said. Trump Responds True to form, Trump didn’t back down in a pair of tweets on Wednesday morning: When you’re already $500 Billion DOWN, you can’t lose! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 4, 2018 We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 4, 2018 U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross also downplayed the impact of the new tariffs, suggesting all the goods covered represent only about 0.3 percent of U.S. GDP. Trump economic advisor Larry Kudlow said it’s possible the tariffs never even go into effect if the U.S. and China can reach a trade agreement in the near future. “He wants to solve this with the least amount of pain,” Kudlow said of Trump. “This is a growth action. I can’t emphasize that enough.” Silver Lining The good news for investors? Allen said China’s aggressive response was likely intended to gain negotiating leverage and put pressure on Trump to have to deal with angry investors and business leaders. Allen said it's still likely the U.S. and China will moderate their trade policies during a negotiation process, but China’s latest action demonstrates it's more determined than many had anticipated. “While we continue to view moderation of both sides' proposals as possible in the coming months, we are reducing our expectations for the scope of US benefits,” Allen said. Market Action Until investors get some clarity on the situation, impacted Chinese and U.S. stocks will likely continue to experience volatile trading. Soybean futures fell about 2 percent, while auto and airline stocks traded down more 3 percent early in the morning before paring those losses as the day went on. Here’s a look at 13 stocks and ETFs impacted by the tariff news: Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) was up 0.2 percent after falling more than 2 percent General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) was up 0.1 percent.

2018-04-06,March Non-Farm Payrolls Trail Expectations; Economist Sees Healthy Normalization,"After a strong start to the year, the labor market showed symptoms of normalizing, allaying some concerns of an overheated economy. The below-consensus job gains for March — along with intensifying fears of a brewing U.S.-China trade war — spooked the markets, as the major averages all opened lower for Friday. The U.S. economy added 103,000 jobs in March, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number was far below the 175,000 job additions that were expected, on average, by economists. The February number was upwardly revised by 13,000 to 326,000, while January's was downwardly revised by 63,000, with the net revision for the first two months of the year being 50,000. The BLS non-farm payrolls data was at odds with the ADP report released earlier in the week, which showed an addition of 241,000 jobs by the private sector in the U.S. The numbers should be taken in a broader context, said Bankrate economist Mark Hamrick. The job market is widely regarded to be close to full employment. So, hiring gains should be slowing at this point in the expansion, he said. Notwithstanding the soft March number, the first quarter's average monthly hiring pace of 202,000 is above the average for all of last year, Hamrick said. If we begin to see signs that momentum is truly slowing in coming months, that's something different [and] more worrying, Hamrick said. The unemployment rate, calculated based on the household survey, held steady at 4.1 percent for the sixth straight month in March vis-à-vis expectations for 4 percent. Source: BLS The labor force participation was little changed at 62.9 percent, and the employment-population ratio stayed put at 60.4 percent. The employment market has been robust in recent times, with the economy adding more than 2 million jobs in 2017 and the jobless rate plunging to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent. The average workweek for private payroll employees remained unchanged at 34.5 hours. The average hourly earnings for employees on private payrolls rose by 8 cents to $26.82. The metric is considered a measure of inflation. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by 71 cents, or 2.7 percent, the BLS release said. The 2.7-percent year-over-year increase is not so hot as what was seen a few months ago, said Bankrate's Hamrick. See also: China ETFs Dealing With Trade Tensions In a tweet on the March jobs report, Mohamed El-Erian of Allianz said the soft headline number and subpar labor participation should ease concerns about an overheated economy. Takeaway from a March #jobs report that met expectations for #wage #growth, undershot on monthly #employment creation & somewhat disappointed on labor participation: Should serve to reduce #markets concerns about an overheating #economy that increases the risk of a policy mistake — Mohamed A. El-Erian (@elerianm) April 6, 2018 A Breakdown By Sector Manufacturing jobs climbed 22,000, with durable goods manufacturing being the standout performer in the sector. Health care jobs also rose by a similar magnitude, in line with the sector's average job gains over the past 12 months. About 9,000 jobs were added by the mining sector, while professional and business services jobs expanded by 33,000. On the other hand, retail jobs contracted by 4,000, and the construction sector lost 15,000 jobs following February's gain of 65,000. Economic, Monetary Implications The softness of the March data along with the geopolitical storm kicked off by the Sino-U.S. trade standoff introduces uncertainty into the economic outlook. Beyond the latest employment data, risks appear to be rising in both the short and long-term. The president is upping the ante in a war of words over trade that threatens to turn into something damaging to global growth, which has been one of the positive dynamics lifting the nation's manufacturing sector of late, Bankrate's Hamrick said. The economist forecast the potential of rising inflation risks if tariffs are fully enacted, making the Fed's job more challenging. Even under a better case scenario, a high degree of uncertainty has been injected into the business environment, which is never a plus, Hamrick said. The March report has not done much to change the Fed's outlook for an ascending trajectory of interest rate hikes, the economist said. As monetary policy eventually ceases to be lifting U.S. economic activity, consumers (and borrowers), business and government will all feel the impacts of surging interest rates.

2018-04-09,Market Technician Lays Out An Important Level To Watch In Gold,"Gold surged in value throughout Friday's trading session while stocks were hard hit. Should this trend continue, it will serve as an ultimate test for stocks, according to Piper Jaffray. The Analyst Piper Jaffray chief market technician Craig Johnson and Susquehanna market strategist Stacey Gilbert. The Thesis The price of one ounce of gold was trading slightly higher Monday morning at $1,333.49 on top of a strong performance last week. But the price of gold needs to break above the $1,365 mark before thinking it's starting a new leg higher, Johnson said during Friday's CNBC Trading Nation segment. If the commodity does break above the key level, however, it would be seen as a real negative event for the overall market. The negative surrounding stocks is the economy is growing and aided by tax cuts, Johnson said. But gold's next leg higher would be seen as a defensive move as gold historically outperforms stocks only when there is excess fear in the market. Meanwhile, gold itself is showing no signs of significant fear, Gilbert added. There's no volatility in the gold options market, which may imply that investors are merely looking at gold right now as a just in case alternative to stocks and a major sell-off in equity is not highly anticipated. We are starting to see money move into gold but, amazingly, with the volatility in the market… gold actually hasn't responded as positively as you would expect if there were true market fear out there, Gilbert said. Price Action Shares of the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) ETF were trading nearly flat Monday at $126.32.

2018-04-11,A New ETF Of ETFs For Diverse Asset Allocation,"A new exchange traded fund aimed at providing diverse asset allocation while limiting volatility debuted Tuesday. The VanEck Vectors Real Asset Allocation ETF (NYSE:RAXX) provides exposure to real assets using the ETF-of-ETFs model. RAXX “seeks to maximize real returns while seeking to reduce downside risk during sustained market declines by allocating primarily to exchange-traded products that provide exposure to real assets, which include commodities, real estate, natural resources and infrastructure,” according to VanEck. The new ETF debuted holding 10 other ETFs, six of which are VanEck funds. RAXX can hold up to 12 ETFs and can go to 100-percent cash in the event of elevated market stress. The RAXX Report RAXX allocates over half its weight to just two ETFs: the PowerShares Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 Portfolio (NASDAQ:PDBC) and the VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE:MOO). The actively managed PDBC features exposure to a broad basket of commodities, including West Texas Intermediate crude, Brent crude, wheat, natural gas, zinc, aluminum, corn, soybeans, gasoline and gold. Speaking of gold, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), the two largest gold ETFs, combine for about 20 percent of RAXX's roster. RAXX holdings “provide exposure to agribusiness, coal, infrastructure, real estate, steel, oil services, unconventional oil and gas and gold mining companies, as well as diversified commodity futures exposure and physical gold,” according to VanEck. Income And Adventure RAXX provides some income-generating potential with modest exposure to master limited partnerships via an almost 5-percent weight to the Global X MLP&Energy Infrastructure ETF (NYSE:MLPX). The new ETF also debuted with some higher beta sector and industry plays, including the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSE:OIH) and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). “RAAX performance is dependent on the performance of underlying funds and is subject to the risks of the underlying funds’ investments,” according to the issuer.

2018-05-07,A New Low-Fee Gold ETF Is Coming,"Home to $36.58 billion in assets under management as of May 3, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) is the world's largest exchange traded fund backed by physical holdings of gold. While GLD remains the go-to choice among gold ETFs for many professional investors due to robust liquidity and tight spreads, it has been losing market share to lower costs rivals, such as the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU). The World Gold Council, which sponsors GLD, is looking to make its presence felt in the low-fee gold ETF tussle with a cheaper product of its own. “The World Gold Council, owner of the world’s largest gold-backed exchange traded fund, is launching a new fund with a cut-price management fee to fend off rivals with lower charges, Reuters reported, citing an unidentified source close to the issue. What Happened GLD debuted in November 2004 as the world's first ETF backed by gold, giving it a significant advantage over later-arriving rivals. The fund even spent a brief period of time as the world's largest ETF of any type. Today, GLD is the 18th-largest U.S.-listed ETF, but by far the largest commodities ETF. Investors have also widely preferred GLD to gold miners equity ETFs, as GLD is more than six times larger than the biggest gold miners fund. Why It's Important The WGC's move to compete on fees is notable because GLD charges 0.4 percent per year, or $40 on a $10,000 investment. That is 15 basis points higher than the annual fee on IAU. IAU debuted two months after GLD and has $12.21 billion in assets under management today. The GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR) debuted in August and charges 0.2 percent per year. The ETF has $14.44 million in assets. It is expected that the new WGC fund will charge in the area of 0.25 percent annually, according to Reuters. What's Next Fees matter across the ETF landscape and that is true with gold ETFs as well. In recent years, IAU has been growing at a far more rapid rate than GLD due in large part to the former's significantly lower fee. “The source said the council’s two funds were designed to appeal to different audiences, with the new product targeted at investors looking to buy and hold gold who want a low management fee, and GLD aimed at financial investors who use its scale and liquidity to trade in and out of positions cheaply,” Reuters reported.

2018-05-07,Demand Challenges Linger For Gold ETFs,"Gold exchange traded funds were decent performers in the first quarter, as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) each gained 0.5 percent. Those performances were arguably impressive in the face of slack demand. Recent data points from the World Gold Council confirm first-quarter gold demand was tepid. “Gold demand of 973.5t was the lowest Q1 since 2008,” said the WGC. “The main cause was a fall in investment demand for gold bars and gold-backed ETFs, partly due to rangebound gold prices.” What Happened Specific to gold ETFs, products such as GLD and IAU were resilient to tepid demand in the first three months of 2018 as investors embraced gold ETFs amid increased equity market volatility. The U.S. dollar was weak for much of Q1, providing an assist to dollar-denominated commodities like gold. In Q1, investors allocated nearly $399 million to GLD, the world's largest gold-backed ETF. IAU saw $1.19 billion in Q1 inflows. Investors favored gold funds even as the Federal Reserve boosted borrowing costs in March, a move that is often seen as punitive to gold because the yellow metal does not offer coupon payments or dividends. Why It's Important “Jewelry demand was steady at 487.7t, as growth in China and the U.S. compensated for weaker Indian demand. Central banks bought 116.5t of gold (42-percent-plus year-over-year),” according to the WGC. “Technology demand extended its recent upward trend, growing 4 percent year-over-year to 82.1t. The total supply of gold increased by 3 percent to 1,063.5t, primarily due to a modest increase in producer hedging. Mine production was fractionally higher at 770t.” Q1 marked the fifth straight quarter of inflows to gold ETFs, but in the first three months of the year, major gold buyers such as China, the U.S. and Germany pared demand for bullion. What's Next Gold is off to a rough in the second quarter. The dollar is surging to start the current quarter, sending GLD and IAU lower by more than 2 percent. Still, investors remain fond of GLD and IAU. The two largest gold ETFs have added $850 million and $760 million, respectively, in Q2.

The North also threatened to cancel the upcoming summit between Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, citing ongoing Max Thunder drills between the U.S. and South Korean air forces. Military drills are a regular complaint by North Korea, which sees them as rehearsals for an invasion. The news is a reversal of North Korea’s recent conciliatory behavior. Just Tuesday morning, the country’s ambassador to the United Nations announced it will join global efforts to ban nuclear weapon tests and Monday analysts reported that satellite imagery seems to show nuclear test sites being dismantled in an apparent gesture of goodwill. What This Means For Investors Without further details, it's hard to say how the markets will react, but so far the news doesn’t seem to be cause for concern. The S&P 500 ticked down by less than half a point following the news while the price of gold held flat. The S&P 500 closed at 2,711.45, down 18 points. The Dow closed at 24,706.41, down 193 points or 0.8 percent. The VIX did rise about by 3.5 percent to a daily high of 14.95, suggesting some traders were spooked by the news, but the volatility index has been creeping slowly for most of the day prior to the news. Generally, volatility isn't considered a concern until the VIX breaches 20, making Tuesday's level still fairly low. Investors should continue to watch for the introduction of headline risk as the week progresses, particularly on further news on the Kim-Trump Summit.

2018-06-13,Federal Reserve Raises Interest Rates For Seventh Time Since 2015,"The Federal Reserve concluded its June meeting by hiking interest rates a quarter percentage point. The seventh raise in two and a half years brings the federal funds rate to a range between 1.75 percent and 2 percent. “The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation,” therelease read. Why It’s Important The decision reflects intel touting continued strengthening of the U.S. labor market, a solid rise in economic activity, strong job gains, a declining unemployment rate and growth in household spending and business fixed investment. The rate tightening indicates federal expectations for continued economic strength. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) rose sharply on the news, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were relatively unfazed. What’s Next As the Wall Street Journal pointed out, international threats, including trade tension and European political instability, may inspire dovish Fed officials to push for a softer rate strategy going forward. Under current conditions, however, the Fed is expected to continue to raise rates. “The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,” the release read.

2018-06-13,Economists Weigh In On Interest Rate Hike,"The rate hike came as no surprise. The Federal Reserve was widely expected to announce a 25-basis-point pop after its Wednesday meeting. Instead, it was the nuance of the policy statement that piqued reactions. “Seemingly comforted by domestic economic dynamism, and confident enough to brush aside the more uncertain international context, the Fed is seen by markets as more hawkish than consensus expectations,” Allianz chief economist Mohamed El-Erian told Benzinga. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said in a press conference that the Fed is strongly committed to 2 percent inflation, and barriers to changing that are very high. How To Read The Release RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas said the language signals the Fed “intends to tolerate temporary deviation away from its inflation target in the near term.” The Fed’s favorable economic outlook was equally revealing. “The upgrade to the summary of economic projections implies that the Fed recognizes it will soon face a monumental decision,” Brusuelas said. The additional announcement that every meeting beginning in January would be followed by press conferences “clearly signaled that change to monetary policy is in the offing,” he added. Traditionally, only four of the monthly meetings preceded conferences, as they alone were considered likely to birth policy change. Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst, similarly deduced preparation for accelerated action. “The labor market is getting tighter and price pressures are picking up,” McBride wrote in an analysis. “The Fed is prepared to be quicker about pushing rates higher – and markets aren’t going to like it.” What’s On The Horizon He expects two more rate hikes in the second half of the year, which are seen to burden borrowers with tight budgets and stunt buying power if not coupled with comparable wage increases. Brusuelas, however, inferred a “growing probability” of just one more hike in 2018, likely in December, as the Fed pursues a perceived optimal policy of 2.55 percent. “While, the remainder of 2018 will be defined by the late cycle fiscal boost in train and risks around the outlook linked to US trade protectionism and political risk in the Eurozone connected to the new government in Italy, the major policy decision by the Federal Reserve that will define the final innings of the business cycle likely arrive in the March to June period of 2019,” Brusuelas said.

2018-06-26,"GLD's Mini-Me Launched By World Gold Council, State Street Global Advisors","Fee wars permeate nearly every corner of the exchange traded funds universe, including commodities funds. It's particularly true with gold ETFs, where issuers are looking to attract more assets with favorable costs. The latest example of this trend is the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM), which debuted Tuesday. What Happened GLDM is issued in partnership by the World Gold Council and State Street Global Advisors, the third-largest U.S. ETF issuer. The two organizations introduced investors to gold ETFs via the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold ETF. “GLDM will be initially listed at a per-share trading price of 1/100th of an ounce of gold, as represented by the LBMA Gold Price PM,” according to a statement issued by SSgA and the WGC. Why It's Important A simple way of looking at GLDM is that is in the “mini-me” version of GLD. Importantly, the new gold ETF sports a significantly lower expense ratio. GLDM's annual fee is 0.18 percent, or $18 on a $10,000 investment — well below the 0.4 percent charged by GLD and below the 0.25 percent charged by the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), the second-largest U.S.-listed gold ETF behind GLD. “GLDM offers the lowest available total expense ratio among all gold exchange-traded products, with a net and gross expense ratio of 0.18 percent,” according to the statement. GLDM is the third gold-backed launched by SSgA and the WGC. GLD and the SPDR Long Dollar Gold Trust (NYSE:GLDW) are the others. What's Next With GLDM being a new ETF, it is too early to judge the fund's asset-gathering proficiency, but it is reasonable to expect the fund will be successful as more advisers and investors gravitate toward ETFs with lower fees. “For many investors, costs associated with buying and selling the shares in the secondary market and the payment of GLDM's ongoing expenses will be lower than the costs associated with buying and selling gold bullion and storing and insuring gold bullion in a traditional allocated gold bullion account,” according to SsgA.

2018-06-28,"Peter Brandt Talks Trump, Oil, Bitcoin And Gold: 'No One's Talking About Farm Prices'","Commodity and forex trader and Factory Trading founder Peter Brandt joined PreMarket Prep on Wednesday to discuss a number of topics, including tariffs, interest rates, crude oil, bitcoin and gold. Brandt is looking forward to trading in his sixth different decade when 2020 rolls around, and he shared some of his trading wisdom with listeners. Trouble For Trump Most commodity prices have been hit hard thanks to the international trade war, and Brandt said President Trump needs to remember in which states his supporters live or he could be in trouble. “You take a look at where corn and wheat and beans are grown, and it’s states that were won by Trump,” Brandt said. “Everybody’s focusing for the election on immigration; no one’s talking about farm prices. I think the Trump White House is in big trouble if for no other reason than egg prices are skidding along the bottom of a 20-year low.” Interest Rates Brandt said he’s not buying the fears that rising interest rates will hurt stock prices. “If the stock market gets hit, it’s not going to be because of rates,” he said. “I took a mortgage out in 1983 at 14 percent. These interest rates are mild. This economy can certainly handle 5 or 6 percent T bill rates.” Oil Outlook Brandt also said crude oil prices could certainly continue higher, but additional upside may be limited at this point. “There’s going to be a point at which fundamentals start to change again, and we’re already seeing supply start to come back online,” he said. “I don’t know where we go from here, but we could get back into the $80's I suppose. For me, there’s no chart signal, so there’s no trade.” Bitcoin’s Bust Brandt also discussed bitcoin's huge 2018 sell-off. He said that assuming bitcoin is the best expression of distributed ledger technology, long-term bulls need to keep the 2018 sell-off and the 2017 run-up in perspective. “There’s never been a market like the bitcoin market, that I can find,” Brandt said about the 2017 run. “It takes a long time then to digest those gains...and it usually takes a lot longer than anyone thinks.” “The average peak to valley to eventually new peak in bitcoin's history as an instrument is 89 weeks, and that’s closer to two years than one year,” he said. Gold Losing Its Luster Finally, Brandt weighed in on gold prices, which have been dropping of late no matter which direction the stock market heads. “I think the December 2017 lows are going to be crucial in gold,” he said. “Gold has big headwind--gold’s at 80 times the price of silver, 1.5 times the price of platinum.” “If I still was short gold, I’d still be hanging with it. Markets always provide a surprise, and the surprise in gold could be we go down and test the $1,000 level again.” Click here to watch Brandt's full interview. Price Action Here’s a look at how some of the popular ETFs related to the commodities Brandt discussed have been trading so far in 2018: PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund (NYSE:DBA) is down 4.9 percent. United States Oil Fund LP (ETF) (NYSE:USO) is up 24.1 percent. Bitcoin Investment Trust (OTC:GBTC) is down 61.1 percent. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) is down 4.1 percent.

2018-07-02,Commodities 101: Gold Futures,"Gold is one of the most important assets on Wall Street, and has been for hundreds of years. It’s by far the most popular of the precious metals—a family that includes copper and silver—and next to oil is the most actively traded commodity on the market. Here’s a primer on how the gold market works. How Gold Is Traded Futures Contracts Like all other commodities, the main way investors trade gold is via futures contracts. These contracts are standard, legally binding agreements that state a specific price and time in the future at which the physical gold can be bought or sold. Gold futures are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and its subsidiary exchanges, which you can access through your broker. Each gold futures contract represents 100 troy ounces of gold, and they’re priced on a dollar-per-ounce basis. In other words: 1 gold futures contract is worth $100. These contracts can be traded in $0.10 increments, and expire at the end of every February, April, June, August, October and December. Other Methods To Trade Gold If you don’t want to trade futures, it’s possible to gain exposure to gold via equity instruments. Several mining companies are publicly traded—Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) and Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:ABX) are the two largest by market cap. There are also ETFs and mutual funds, such as the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), that have a broader exposure to mining companies. Some people like to even own physical gold, either in the form of coins or bullion (bars). What Makes Gold Popular? Gold is historically very popular among investors because of its use as a hedging and diversification tool. The yellow metal is seen as a “safe haven,” meaning people tend to buy gold during times of uncertainty in the stock market or economy and sell it during times of strength. The relationship between gold and equities can vary. They can be inversely correlated at times, and directly correlated at others. This change in correlation is something market watchers pay close attention to, as gold can sometimes forecast the equities market, and vice versa. The following charts from VantagePoint show this relationship in action. The first chart shows gold futures during the first half of 2018. The second shows the S&P 500 futures during that same time. Gold futures in 2018 Chart courtesy of VantagePoint S&P 500 futures in 2018 Chart courtesy of VantagePoint Notice how the charts are inverses of each other at times, and move in lockstep at others. You can see how gold withstands periods of weakness more than equities. For example the volatility in February led to a big drop in the S&P 500 futures, while gold held up a little more. The same can be said for late-March. From April onward there’s a clear inverse correlation. Gold has repeatedly made lower lows, while the S&P 500 has made higher highs. This what’s known as a “risk on” environment, where investors are more willing to invest in “riskier” assets (relatively speaking). That’s why the S&P 500 future rose and gold futures fell during this time. Gold has been in a clear downtrend since April 20, during which it’s dropped 8 percent. The S&P 500 futures on the other, despite a downtrend over the last two weeks, have been flat during that time. The inverse correlation may be tough to spot when looking at a particular week or month, but by zooming out on a 6-month chart we can clearly see the relationship play out from late-April to late-June. Related Markets Gold’s unique position makes it one of the most influential markets in the world. How gold moves can influence the prices of the rest of the commodities market, the U.S. dollar, and the largest indices in the world like the Dow Jones and S&P 500. These are the most correlated markets, according to VantagePoint. Chart courtesy of VantagePoint Gold’s versatility is what makes it one of the most widely followed markets in the world. But don’t underestimate the impact it can have on the rest of the global markets, and the impact the global markets can have on it. These relationships are at the core of trading gold.

2018-07-19,Trump Weighs In On The Federal Reserve: 'I'm Not Thrilled',"Presidents rarely criticize the Federal Reserve while they are in office, but Donald Trump has never been one to follow Washington conventions. On Thursday, Trump addressed the Fed interest rate hikes in 2018 in an interview with CNBC, and the market reaction shows investors were listening. What Happened? After praising newly appointed Fed Chair Jerome Powell, Trump pushed back on Powell's policies. “I’m not thrilled,” Trump told CNBC. “Because we go up and every time you go up they want to raise rates again. I don’t really — I am not happy about it.” Trump said he is concerned that rising interest rates might impact the coutnry's economic growth. Why It’s Important The Federal Reserve uses interest rate hikes to help keep inflation in check, preserve the value of the U.S. dollar and keep the prices of goods stable. Interest rate cuts are also a powerful tool to help fight economic downturns, but rates have been near zero for most of the period since the financial crisis of 2008. Returning rates to a normal level gives the Fed ammunition to potentially combat the next recession. Trump said additional Fed rate hikes could put the U.S. at a “disadvantage” compared to other global economies; Powell said earlier this week that he believes the U.S. economy is strong enough to digest additional rate hikes. The U.S. economy is on pace to expand by about 3 percent in 2018, and economists are expecting two more U.S. rate hikes by the end of the year. What’s Next Investors will be watching to see how much market fallout Trump’s comments will create. Here’s a look at how a few popular investments were reacting on Thursday: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was down 0.2 percent. PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE:UUP) was down 0.1 percent. iShares Barclays 20+ Yr Treas.Bond (ETF) (NYSE:TLT) was up 0.6 percent. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) was down 0.2 percent.

2018-08-16,"With Gold Sliding, A New ETF Debuts","Gold prices and the related exchange traded funds are in a tailspin. Over the past month, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold ETF, is down almost 4 percent. That is not preventing some issuers from testing the waters with new gold ETFs. On Wednesday, the Perth Mint Physical Gold ETF (NYSE:AAAU) debuted. What Happened The Perth Mint is the largest precious metals refiner in Australia. With the new AAAU, 100 shares of that ETF will be the equivalent of owning 1 ounce of physical gold. The government of Western Australia backs the physical gold investment in AAAU. “The Perth Mint’s new ETF will be backed by physical gold and will give investors the option to take physical delivery from its gold products,” reports Reuters. Why It's Important Some ETF issuers have been launching new gold funds with lower fees in an effort to attract more attention from investors. For example, the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM) debuted in late June with an annual expense ratio of 0.18 percent, or $18 on a $10,000 investment. At the time, that made GLDM the least expensive gold ETF in the U.S. Data suggest there is enthusiasm for cost-effective gold ETFs, as highlighted by GLDM's $111.29 million in assets under management, a solid effort for an ETF that is less than two months old. The new AAAU also has an annual fee of 0.18 percent, but the fund's expenses are “charged in ounces at the time of production rather than in dollars after the fee is converted,” according to Reuters. What's Next Perth Mint operates the only government-backed investment and precious metals storage offering in the world. The enterprise said it is mulling other ETFs, but declined to elaborate on details for those products in the Reuters article.

2018-08-22,"2 Weeks, $1 Billion For This New ETF","In the world of exchange traded funds, experts and industry observers often say a new ETF needs to get to $100 million in assets under management to become profitable for the issuer and be “legitimized.” Getting to $1 billion, however, is a different ballgame. One new ETF is breaking the mold on asset-gathering expectations for rookie funds. What Happened As has been previously highlighted in this space, some new ETFs from JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) are rapidly attracting assets. That includes the JPMorgan BetaBuilders Canada ETF (CBOE: BBCA). Here's the BBCA asset-gathering breakdown in the simplest terms: the ETF debuted on Aug. 7. By Aug. 20, it had $1.28 billion in assets under management, according to issuer data. Why It's Important As ETF.com reports, BBCA is the second-fastest ETF to $1 billion in assets under management. The new Canada ETF supplanted its stablemate, the JPMorgan BetaBuilders Japan ETF (CBOE: BBJP) as the second-fastest ETF to $1 billion. Only the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) was faster to $1 billion in assets, reaching that enviable milestone in just three days. Here's another way of looking at BBCA's asset-gathering prowess. The iShares MSCI Canada ETF (NYSE:EWC) is the largest U.S.-listed Canada ETF and has $3 billion in assets under management, but EWC is almost 23 years old. It took BBCA just two weeks to become more than a third of the size of competing fund that's more than two decades old. What's Next Clearly, BBCA and EWC are headed for a tussle among U.S.-listed Canada ETFs. The new JPMorgan ETF holds 94 stocks compared to 91 in EWC. The iShares ETF devotes almost 63 percent of its combined weight to the financial services and energy sectors, comparable to the 61.3 percent allocated to those groups by JPMorgan's BBCA. The marquee difference is fees. As in BBCA charges just 0.19 percent per year compared to 0.49 percent by EWC. Related Links: These New ETFs Are Already Huge Real Estate Rises In These ETFs"
2018-09-07,"A Look At The ETFs With The Most Inflows And Outflows In August, And What They'll Do Going Forward","After a red-hot 2017, the ETF market has cooled down slightly. As of the end of July, $153 billion had flown into ETFs in 2018 according to Oppenheimer. While that’s well above 2016’s end-of-July pace of $111 billion, it’s nearly 45 percent below 2017’s rate of $272 billion. Fund flow, the measure of the net amount of money that’s gone in and out of a fund over a specific period of time, is an important tool to track for ETF traders and investors. While it doesn’t measure performance (that’d be price) or popularity (that’s volume), a lot of inflows or outflows of a specific fund can tell us that something is happening. And that could be enough of a signal to put a fund on your radar. It’s hard to tell by looking at fund flow alone just which side of the trade the money is going toward. A lot of inflows could mean investors have rushed to buy a fund, or it could also mean shorts are covering their positions. Sometimes a lot of inflows can even signal a selling opportunity, as this can signal an overcrowded trade. That said, we thought we’d take a look at some of the ETFs with the most inflows and outflows for August, according to ETF.com’s fund flow tool, and cross-reference them with VantagePoint’s predictive indicators, which forecast price over the next 1-3 days. The software’s artificial intelligence and intermarket analysis forecasts trends with up to 86 percent accuracy. Let’s see what they say about about how these funds are positioned heading into fall. Funds With Inflows QQQ The Invesco QQQ Trust (NYSE:QQQ) had $3.9 billion of inflows in August, making it the fund with the second-most inflows in the month, and had risen 4.5 percent during this time. According to VantagePoint’s two main indicators, a predicted moving average and predicted neural index, the QQQ has recently crossed over into what looks like a pretty severe downtrend, and should move even lower in the coming days. Chart as of Sept. 6 close, courtesy of VantagePoint Software Looking at the fund’s top holdings, this forecast isn’t a surprise. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) combine to make up more than one-third of the fund, in fact technology makes up more than 60 percent of the fund, and all have fallen off since the end of August. VOO The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO) had $1.9 billion of inflows last month, and had risen 3.5 percent in lockstep. This fund is more diversified than QQQ, which technology stocks making up only 26 percent of the fund and no stock makes up more than 4 percent. Plus, the ripping financial sector has strong representation, with stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class B (NYSE: BRK-B) in the top 10 components. VantagePoint is showing a recent shift to a downtrend for this fund as well. After making a new all-time high on August 29 the fund has closed down or flat four of the next five days. The new all-time highs being made in the overall market bode well for a fund like this, which VantagePoint says has been in an uptrend since July 6. Chart as of Sept. 6 close, courtesy of VantagePoint Software Funds With Outflows SPY The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) had $5.3 billion in outflows in August, making it the fund with the most share redemptions despite the fact it has a very similar allocation to VOO. According to VantagePoint’s indicators, SPY is following the trend of the previous two ETFs mentioned. The fund is down about 1.5 percent over the last week. Chart as of Sept. 6 close, courtesy of VantagePoint Software GLD The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) had $1.7 billion of redemptions in August, good for second-most of all ETFs in the month. This fund looks like it’s trying to turn into an uptrend, but it’s having trouble. VantagePoint’s indicators are telling us that it had a bullish crossover, but the fund has mostly traded in a range between $111-$114 the last two weeks. Chart as of Sept. 6 close, courtesy of VantagePoint Software The biggest thing to take away from fund flow is that it’s another tool for traders and investors to have in their toolbox. Fund flow cannot solely indicate whether a fund will move higher or lower, but it can tell us that other people think they know. VantagePoint is a content partner of Benzinga.

2018-10-11,Gold ETF Fee Battle Intensifies,"While gold and the related exchange traded funds are struggling this year, some investors remain fond of the yellow metal and some ETF issuers are rewarding that faith with lower expenses. Upstart ETF issuer GraniteShares announced a new, reduced annual expense ratio for the GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR). What To Know BAR debuted in August with an annual fee of 0.20 percent, or $20 on a $10,000 investment. At the time, BAR was the least expensive gold ETF on the market. While the environment for gold has been challenging since BAR came to market, some investors are displaying enthusiasm for the low-cost gold ETF. BAR has about $280 million in assets under management, easily making it one of the most successful commodities ETFs to come to market last year. Why It's Important BAR's low fee inspired fee cuts and the debut of competing, low-cost gold funds, but GraniteShares is taking its low-cost leadership. The company announced it's paring BAR's annual fee to 0.1749 percent, or $17.50 per year on a $10,000 investment. That renews BAR's status as the least expensive gold fund currently available to U.S. investors. BAR's fee cut was announced as some analysts are forecasting a rebound for the yellow metal and precious metals miners. Although there is little evidence that inflation is accelerating (as of now) or that the end of this bull market is imminent, we argue that gold miners should be given a larger weight in investors’ portfolio for the following reasons: i) the economic cycle continues to mature; ii) asset valuation multiples are expanding and asset bubbles are emerging in certain areas; iii) budget deficits are increasing at alarming rates; and iv) quarterly earnings will face tougher comps in 2019, bringing into question how much longer this record-breaking bull market can continue,” said CFRA Research equity analyst Matthew Miller in a recent note. What's Next BAR and rival gold ETFs could benefit from short covering as bearish traders have recently load up on short gold positions. “For the week ending September 25, money managers increased their speculative gross long positions in Comex gold futures by 609 contracts to 98,513, while short positions increased by 1,823 contracts to 182,190. This means that gold’s net short position is 83,677 contracts,” according to Miller. “The gold market could be poised for a short-covering rally, as investors are likely to start closing out their record level of short positions, given gold’s resilience to not break below key levels of support.” Related Links: A New IPO ETF Bell Tolls For These Leveraged ETFs"
2018-10-11,"Inflation: What It Is, Where It Comes From And How To Protect Your Portfolio From It","The U.S. economy is firing on all cylinders, which is generally good news for investors. Yet a booming economy also creates its own set of unique financial problems — and inflation is at the top of the list. What Is Inflation? The U.S. unemployment rate is at its lowest level in four decades at 3.7 percent. While that low unemployment rate is great news for American workers, it’s not necessarily great news for U.S. companies looking to grow their businesses. These companies are now competing to hire a dwindling number of qualified employees, and the increasing competition for labor eventually leads to companies being forced to raise wages. While rising wages are good for workers, increasing labor costs eat into corporate profits, making it harder to grow earnings. To compensate, companies in a booming economy tend to pass those costs on to their customers by raising prices. As a result, the purchasing power of a dollar decreases over time. Why Do Investors Care? For an investor, inflation is a constant enemy. Back in 1940, $3,000 was sufficient to buy a nice house in the U.S. But if someone had buried that $3,000 in their backyard in 1940 and dug it up in 2018, $3,000 today would barely be enough to buy a beat-up used car. Inflation puts constant pressure on investors to generate positive returns just to maintain their purchasing power. The Federal Reserve is tasked with managing inflation rates by raising or lowering interest rates, and its target inflation rate is 2 percent. In August, the U.S. inflation rate was 2.7 percent, but it has approached 3 percent this year for the first time since 2011. How To Combat Inflation Historically, inflation has been bad news for U.S. stocks. Since the 1930s, stocks have produced annualized gains of just 1 percent during periods in which inflation rose for at least six months. The rest of the time, the market generated annualized gains of about 7 percent. Fortunately, there are several ways for investors to combat inflation. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, or TIPS, are treasury bonds that are indexed to inflation and adjusted every six months to neutralize the impact of inflation. TIPS can be purchased directly from the Treasury, or investors can buy TIPS ETFs such as the iShares Barclays TIPS Bond Fund (NYSE:TIP). Commodities and real assets also tend to perform well during inflationary periods; real estate investment trusts have historically outperformed during inflationary periods. Gold and oil are also popular inflationary hedges. The VANGUARD IX FUN/RL EST IX FD ETF (NYSE:VNQ), the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the United States Oil Fund LP (NYSE:USO) are three popular ways to invest in these themes.

2018-11-28,Powell Vs. Trump: Fed Chair Hits Dovish Tone As President Ramps Up Criticism,"Investors got what they were hoping for from the Federal Reserve Wednesday when Chairman Jerome Powell said interest rates are currently “just below” neutral. Powell’s statement comes after he was harshly criticized by President Donald Trump this week, who appointed Powell as Fed chair earlier this year. More Dovish Fed Powell’s latest language is much more dovish than a statement he made in October in which he said rates were still “a long way” from neutral. “Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy — that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth,” Powell said at the Economic Club of New York on Wednesday. The fed funds rate stands at a target range of between 2 percent and 2.25 percent. Economists widely anticipate more rate hikes in the next year, but Powell said there's no present plan for monetary policy. “While FOMC participants’ projections are based on our best assessments of the outlook, there is no preset policy path,” Powell said. Trump’s Criticism Trump lashed out at Powell Tuesday, telling The Washington Post he has been displeased with Powell’s rate hikes since he took over as Fed chair. “So far, I’m not even a little bit happy with my selection of Jay,” Trump said. “They’re making a mistake because I have a gut and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else’s brain can ever tell me.” The central bank has historically operated independently of political influence, and Trump’s criticism of Powell is unusual compared to the behavior of past presidents. Whether or not the more dovish take from Powell was a result of pressure by Trump, investors cheered the news. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was up 1.5 percent Wednesday afternoon.

Sort Of,"The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and rival gold-backed exchange traded funds traded modestly higher Wednesday after Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said interest rates are close to “neutral.” Three interest rate hikes this year and the subsequently stronger dollar are among the most widely cited reasons for explaining gold's struggles this year. What Happened GLD, the largest gold ETF by assets, entered Wednesday with a year-to-date loss of 7 percent before gaining 0.37 percent on above-average volume. “Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy--that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth,” Powell said in a speech at The Economic Club of New York. Why It's Important Higher interest rates are seen as a drag on gold because the yellow metal and the related ETFs don't pay a coupon or interest, leaving little incentive for income-starved investors to embrace bullion in rising rate environments. Still, GLD has been a solid performer for the bulk of the Fed's current tightening cycle. Over the past three years, a period in which the Fed has hiked rates eight times, GLD is up about 12.4 percent while the dollar is flat. Even with Powell's somewhat bullish comments, markets are pricing in an almost 83 percent of another interest rate increase next month, according to CME Group data. Some investors are bullish on gold for 2019. According to Legg Mason's Global Investment Survey 2018, “23 percent of investors said that they see gold as one of the best investment opportunities next year, unchanged from 2017,” reports Kitco News. What's Next A sustained rally for gold could lift downtrodden gold miners stocks and ETFs, assets that are dirt cheap on valuation but vulnerable to gold lagging other investments. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, gained 2.49 percent yesterday, adding to a modest fourth-quarter gain.

2018-12-19,The Federal Reserve Issues Fourth Rate Hike Of 2018,"On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve delivered the interest rate hike the markets were expecting. The Fed announced it will be upping the fed funds target rate by 0.25 percent to a range of 2.25-2.50 percent. “The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term,” the Fed said in its statement. Applying The Brakes? The Fed also lowered its target projections for future interest rates. The Fed lowered its 2019 fed funds rate projection from 3.1 percent to 2.9 percent and its 2020 and 2021 projections from 3.4 percent to 3.1 percent. The Fed also lowered its 2018 U.S. GDP growth projection from 3.1 percent to 3 percent and its 2019 growth projection from 2.5 percent to 2.3 percent. Finally, the consensus dot plot projections for 2019 suggest two more rate hikes next year, down from three rate hikes projected back in September. Interest rates are already at their highest level of the past decade. Economists React RSM US LLP chief economist Joe Brusuelas said investors likely didn’t get what they were hoping for from the Fed. “The statement and the summary of economic projections were not as dovish as many market participants desired, which from our vantage point does suggest that the Fed will hike rates as many as twice in 2019,” Brusuelas said following the Fed’s decision. “Thus, investors or policymakers who are concluding that it’s one and done for the Fed are likely to be disappointed in the year ahead.” Brusuelas said a subtle shift in language could provide a hint about the Fed’s 2019 plan. “The committee added the word 'some' to the phrase 'further gradual increases' which implies the Fed could pause for a variety of risks to the economic outlook in 2019,” he said. Bankrate.com chief financial analyst Greg McBride said investors may not see another rate hike for quite some time. “The Fed downshifted their projections of 2019 economic growth, inflation, and interest rate hikes – not in a big way but enough to remove the urgency of repeated rate hikes,” McBride said. “Interest rate hikes produce turbulence for the stock market but do result in better returns for savers and investors looking for a safe haven.” What's Next Rising interest rates are generally bad for stock prices, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) both turned negative following the announcement, although they did recover and were trading in positive territory at time of pubclation. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was also down 0.4 percent on Wednesday. The market expects the Fed to hit pause on its tightening in 2019. According to CME Group, the fed fund futures market is pricing in 56.6 percent chance the fed funds rate will be at or below its current level by the December 2019 Fed meeting.

2018-12-20,"Experts Break Down Fed Commentary, Markets Disagree With Powell","Investors clearly didn’t get what they wanted to hear from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped to their lowest levels of 2018 after the Fed raised interest rates for the fourth time and said investors can expect two additional rate hikes in 2019. A number of analysts and experts have weighed in on the Fed’s decision and what it means for the markets. Here’s a sampling of what they’ve had to say. Fed Put Disappearing Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner said the Fed is demonstrating tough love for the U.S. economy. “The message from core FOMC policymakers in recent months has been clear: they intend to stretch the expansion for as long as possible, and some moderation in financial conditions after a prolonged period of easing over the prior year arguably might serve that goal,” Zentner wrote. Appaloosa Management hedge fund manager David Tepper told CNBC Wednesday’s news is a signal the Fed is no longer supporting the stock market. “Powell basically told you the Fed put is dead...cash is not so bad,” Tepper said. Salman Ahmed, global investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, said the subtle changes to the Fed’s outlook were not enough to ease market fears. “It appears that risky asset markets wanted a stronger 'put' from the Fed given the ongoing recession obsession taking over the market sentiment,” Ahmed said. Markets Disagree With Powell DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas said Wednesday’s press conference was a sign the Fed and the market are completely at odds about what to expect from the economy in 2019. “It isn’t just Chair Powell that thinks markets have it wrong. The Federal Open Market Committee is also collectively confident that 2019’s US economic growth will merit further rate increases,” Colas wrote. Deutsche Bank analyst Peter Hooper said the Fed actually took a step toward a more dovish approach on Wednesday, but it simply wasn’t as big of a step as investors had anticipated. “Although more rate hikes are likely coming, the timing is now less certain, as the Fed has clearly moved closer to slowing the current pace of tightening,” Hooper wrote. CNBC's Jim Cramer said the knee-jerk market reaction could have been much worse than it ended up being given what the Fed had to say: “You could easily argue that we should've been down 1,000 Dow points. Investors Overreacting? Nigel Green, founder and chief executive of deVere Group, said the Fed appears willing to pause its tightening program in 2019 if circumstances deteriorate. “The Federal Reserve has signaled that next year’s planned interest rate hikes may be delayed if economic data weakens, which last week’s relatively modest payrolls data and November’s inflation data suggests is the case,” Green wrote. A Wealth of Common Sense’s Ben Carlson pointed out on Twitter that the 12.6 percent decline from the S&P 500 in the period leading up to Wednesday’s rate hike was the largest such drop in history, despite the fact that inflation is just 2.2 percent. This is now the worst S&P 500 drawdown leading into a Fed rate hike since 1970. Here are the top 5 along w/the inflation rate at that time One of these things is not like the others pic.twitter.com/Fzi5rCxJlX — Ben Carlson (@awealthofcs) December 19, 2018 Price Action The negative market reaction to the Fed spilled over into Thursday morning trading. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was down another 0.3 percent, and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was down 0.2 percent.

2019-01-02,This Commodity Boasts One Of The Best-Performing ETFs For January,"The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV), the largest silver exchange traded fund listed in the U.S., lost 8.74 percent last year, but seasonal traders may want to consider the silver fund in the first month of 2019. Over the previous 10 years, SLV is one of the best-performing non-leveraged ETFs in January. What Happened Aside from the palladium fund, precious metals ETFs generally struggled last year as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates four times and the dollar rallied. Commodities are denominated in dollars, often making the asset class inversely correlated to the greenback. Higher interest rates often diminish the allure of gold or silver because those assets and the related ETFs, like SLV, don't pay interest or dividends. Silver often displays some correlation to gold, but SLV's 2018 loss was more than quadruple that of the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and other gold-backed ETFs. Why It's Important Over the past decade, SLV has posted seven positive January performances with an average gain of 4.59 percent in the first month of the year, according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. SLV could be poised to live up to its January precedent after a strong end to 2018. “While Wall Street has suffered in December, SLV has shot higher, set for a monthly gain of 8.4% -- its best month since January 2017,” said Schaeffer's. “The ETF is now staring up at its 200-day moving average, which hasn't been toppled on a daily closing basis since June. For 2018, however, SLV is still on pace for a loss of nearly 10%. From its current perch around $14.44, another 4.59% gain would place it around $15.10 -- back above the aforementioned trendline -- to start February.” What's Next Silver demand was mostly tepid in 2018, indicating the metal needs the global economy to remain on firm footing in 2019 to spur a potential silver rally. Much of the demand case for the white metal is tied to industrial customers, meaning an unexpected slowdown in global economic activity could weigh on silver in the new year. Data indicate silver is the cheapest it has been relative to gold in over two decades, which could lure some investors to the white metal.

2019-01-04,Fed Chair Powell: 'We Will Be Patient',"The S&P 500 surged more than 3 percent Friday, and much of the bullish sentiment stemmed from dovish comments made by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Powell and former Fed Chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke participated in a roundtable discussion at the America Economic Association’s annual meeting in Atlanta and Powell’s comments reassured investors the Fed is taking a cautious approach to further tightening in 2019. Patient And Flexible Powell said the Fed has no predetermined course of action this year after the FOMC projected two additional interest rate hikes in 2019 at its most recent meeting in December. “Particularly with muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves,” Powell said Friday. Powell said a perfect example of the Fed’s flexibility was in 2016. After initially projecting four rate hikes that year, the Fed instead raised rates only once after concerns about a slowing economy in China and other geopolitical risks spooked investors. “We will be prepared to adjust policy quickly and flexibly and to use all of our tools to support the economy should that be appropriate to keep the expansion on track, to keep the labor market strong and to keep inflation near 2 percent,” Powell said. No Surprises Bernanke said slowing economic growth “is not something that is news” considering the normalization process following years of stimulus. Yellen said projected 2019 growth is “still likely to end up being above the growth rate of potential, which is consistent with a strong labor market and maybe even some further tightening.” Trump’s Criticism U.S. President Donald Trump, who replaced Yellen with Powell nearly a year ago, has been publicly critical of the Federal Reserve’s decision to continue to raise interest rates. “They’re raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good,” Trump said in December. Trump also told reporters “will see” when asked if he has confidence in Powell. “The only problem our economy has is the Fed,” Trump later tweeted. Bernanke said Trump’s criticism of the Fed is problematic. “Yeah I think everyone would be better off if it was clear that the Fed is making its decision based on its mandate and on its assessment of long-term needs in the economy which I'm completely confident that it will do,” Bernanke said. Markets liked what they heard from the group on Friday. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was up 3.3 percent and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was up 3.4 percent Friday.

2019-01-14,"Cramer Talks Gold, Newmont-Goldcorp Deal","Gold is becoming more attractive amid global uncertainty ranging from central bank interest rate policies to the U.S.-China trade dispute, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday. What Happened Gold should be considered an insurance policy for investors to hedge their portfolio against economic uncertainty and market volatility, Cramer said during his daily Mad Money show. Exposure to gold at a time when the Federal Reserve hinted it will be more patient with interest rate raises is the whole point of diversification, to be prepared in case something goes wrong ... and your thesis doesn't pan out, he said. Investors with sufficient cash on hand to buy and store physical gold bars at around $1,255 per ounce should do so, Cramer said. Those with less cash on hand should avoid gold coins, which are sold at a steep markup at coin dealers, he said. Rather, investors can gain exposure to swings in gold prices through the exchange traded fund SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Gold is typically a winner in times of chaos and uncertainty, so investors who are concerned with their exposure to other asset classes should own at least a little to hedge against the unknown. Cramer On Newmont-Goldcorp Deal Gold and copper producer Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) reached an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Goldcorp Inc. (NYSE:GG), a senior gold producer that oversees several high-quality mines. As part of the agreement, Newmont will acquire each Goldcorp share for 0.3280 shares of its own stock, which implies a 17-percent premium based on the two companies' 20-day volume weighted average share prices. Monday's merger announcement comes just a few days after Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) finalized and absorbed its acquisition of Randgold Resources. From an investor point of view, Cramer said Monday that he likes the Barrick-Randgold tie-up much more, as Randgold was both a growth company and dividend-oriented. Goldcorp was a tremendously horrible stock to own ahead of Monday's merger announcement and reflected the underappreciated risk in owning a gold company vs. a gold-focused ETF, Cramer said. Newmont Mining is at best consistent, but has had a hard time keeping its costs down, much like other gold companies, the CNBC host said. Related Links: Powell Pushes Gold ETFs Higher...

2019-01-24,"Investors Want A Bitcoin ETF, According To A New Bitwise Survey","It remains one of the most elusive concepts in the world of exchange traded funds, but there is demand for an ETF linked to bitcoin. A new survey from Bitwise Asset Management, which is trying to launch a bitcoin ETF of its own, indicates a fair amount of financial advisors would like to see a bitcoin ETF come to market. What Happened Bitwise recently commissioned a survey of 150 financial advisors and the results regarding demand for a bitcoin ETF are encouraging. “A strong majority -- 58% -- said that an ETF would be their preferred way to invest,” according to the Bitwise survey. “When asked what would make them more comfortable allocating to crypto in client portfolios, 54% said 'better regulation' and 35% said 'the launch of an ETF.'” A bitcoin ETF, which U.S. regulators have yet to approve, is widely viewed as an avenue for increasing adoption of bitcoin and bringing cryptocurrencies further into the mainstream from the fringes of financial markets. Why It's Important Last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission rejected applications for bitcoin ETFs from ProShares, Direxion and GraniteShares, among other issuers. The SEC is considering an application for an institutionally-focused bitcoin ETF from VanEck and fintech firm SolidX, but a decision on that fund was previously delayed and could be delayed further due to the government shutdown. With hundreds of new ETFs coming to market every year, it may seem like it's easy to bring these products to market, but Bitwise reminds industry observers that concepts that look easy to launch today once faced hurdles similar to what bitcoin ETFs currently face. It took six years from the first filings for actively managed and leveraged ETFs to see those products come to life and there was a nine-year gap in between the launch of the first equity-based ETF and the first fixed income ETF, according to Bitwise. What's Next Bitwise draws some comparisons between the state of bitcoin ETF efforts today and the situation faced by the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) prior to its late 2004 launch. “Prior to the launch of GLD, there were plenty of ways for investors to buy gold,” said Bitwise. “They could buy it directly from dealers, they could buy futures, or they could buy gold mining stocks. In many ways, it was exactly equivalent to today’s situation with bitcoin, where investors can buy directly on exchanges, can buy futures or can invest indirectly via blockchain equity ETFs.” There are no guarantees a bitcoin ETF, if approved, will find the immediate success that GLD did, but a bitcoin ETF would make the digital currency more accessible and potentially more palatable to a broader swath of investors.

2019-01-30,Gold Industry Says Cryptos Are No Substitute As Safe Haven,"As the cryptocurrency space has evolved, adopters and endorsers have tried to frame bitcoin and other digital assets as credible stores of value and potential alternatives to traditional safe-haven assets — including precious metals. Over bitcoin's just over a decade of life, some market observers have compared the largest cryptocurrency by market value to gold, but some gold analysts see things differently. What Happened Bitcoin missed a golden opportunity last year to prove its chops as a safe-haven asset, the World Gold Council said in a Tuesday report. Instead, bitcoin shed approximately 80 percent of its market value and was drubbed in the fourth quarter, a period in which gold and the related exchange traded funds climbed. “In Q4 2018, as global stock markets experienced their worst quarter since 2009, cryptocurrencies had a prime opportunity to demonstrate qualities associated with safe havens like gold,” said the WGC. “However, cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, behaved like risky assets and fell while gold rallied.” In partnership with State Street, the WGC launched the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's first gold-backed ETF, in November 2004. Today, GLD is the world's largest gold ETF, with $34.13 billion in assets under management. Bitcoin is the only digital currency with a market value that exceeds GLD's assets under management. Why It's Important “Though comparisons have been made, we believe there are several reasons why cryptocurrencies are no substitute for gold,” the WGC said. “Specifically, gold is less volatile and enjoys a more liquid and established market. It has a well-understood role in an investment portfolio and minimal overlap with cryptocurrencies on many sources of demand and supply.” As is the case with gold and other commodities, bitcoin has a futures market, but it is not yet as robust as that of gold. Bitcoin futures debuted on the CBOE and CME in late 2017, but as the value of digital currency plunged last year, futures volume dwindled. “Finally, the market value traded in the bitcoin futures market fell sharply in the quarter at a time when volumes in global markets and gold rose,” according to the WGC. “The support of a strong two-way market was lacking, suggesting bitcoin — unlike gold — does not provide the liquidity needed in times of financial tension.” What's Next JPMorgan analyst John Normand said in a Bloomberg interview that gold has been a better hedge than bitcoin since July 2010, despite bitcoin often sporting low correlations to more traditional asset classes.

2019-01-30,Federal Reserve Unanimously Votes To Leave Rates Unchanged,"As Fed officials intimated and economists predicted, the Federal Open Markets Committee unanimously voted Wednesday to maintain interest rates between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent. Its statement assured constant rates for some time. What Happened After four rate raises in 2018, the Fed reiterated a new policy of “patience” as it awaits clarity on how slowing global growth and market volatility affect domestic outlook. The central bank altered its policy statement to eliminate outlook for gradual increases. “The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes,” the statement read. “In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.” The FOMC also approved a primary credit rate at 3 percent. Why It’s Important Rate changes reflect the Fed’s economic analysis and forecast. Generally, it raises rates in response to high economic growth. Increases curb inflation, preserve the value of the dollar, stabilize prices, and depress borrowing, consumer spending, business profits and stock market performance. Changes in trade policy and adjustments in federal spending — current variables in the U.S. economic equation — can stunt GDP growth and warrant less aggressive rates. The Fed’s “patience” seems to reflect near-term economic uncertainty, although officials said they continue to see sustained expansion. “In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective,” the statement read. “This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

2019-02-02,Central Banks Drove Gold Demand In 2018,"Gold and the related exchange traded funds were challenged last year by the strong dollar and rising U.S. interest rates, but that did not prevent some buyers from stepping up bullion purchases. New data from the World Gold Council shows global gold demand increased by 4 percent last year. What Happened “Gold demand in 2018 reached 4,345.1t, up from 4,159.9t in 2017 and in line with the five-year average of 4,347.5t,” according to the WGC. Last year, investors pulled $1.79 billion from the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed ETF, but investors did allocate capital to lower-cost gold ETFs. For example, the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) saw $1.59 billion worth of inflows last year. The GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR), one of the newest and cheapest gold ETFs, saw 2018 inflows of just over $310 million. Why It's Important While U.S. ETF purchases of gold were mixed throughout 2018, global central banks supported bullion demand in significant fashion. “A multi-decade high in central bank buying (651.5t) drove growth,” said the WGC. “Demand was bumped up in Q4 by 112.4t of ETF inflows, but annual inflows into these products (of 68.9t) were 67% lower than 2017.” Central bank gold purchases were the second-highest on record last year as central banks in Russia and Turkey, among others, embraced the yellow metal. “Net purchases jumped to their highest since the end of US dollar convertibility into gold in 1971, as a greater pool of central banks turned to gold as a diversifier,” according to the WGC. What's Next With dollar strength moderating and expectations in place that the Federal Reserve wont' raise interest rates this year, each of the aforementioned U.S.-listed gold ETFs have added new assets, led by $1.51 billion of inflows to GLD. Last year, “coin demand surged to reach a five-year high of 236.4t, the second highest on record. Demand for gold bars held steady at 781.6t, the fifth year in succession of holding in a firm 780-800t range,” according to the WGC.

2019-03-04,Crossed Over: Crossover Bond ETF Will Become A Regular Junk Bond Fund,"The final week of February was packed with exciting news from the world of exchange traded funds. News emerged that the first zero-fee ETFs are on their way and that was met with a slew of fee cuts by industry giant Vanguard. But wait. There's more. What Happened Last Friday, State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT), the third-largest U.S. ETF issuer, said it's changing the name, index and investment objective for the fund currently known as the SPDR ICE BofAML Crossover Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE:CJNK) while significantly lowering the annual fee on that product. CJNK, which debuted in June 2012, follows the ICE BofAML US Diversified Crossover Corporate Index. Crossover bonds are corporate debt that reside where the lower end of the investment-grade and high-yield universes intersect. Why It's Important On April 1, CJNK will become the SPDR ICE BofAML Broad High Yield Bond ETF and transition to the widely followed ICE BofAML US High Yield Index. CJNK's ticker will remain the same, but its annual expense ratio will be pared by 25 basis points to 0.15 percent, or $15 on a $10,000 investment. State is implementing a strategy it has previously used with other funds, launching a lower cost alternative to an existing product that is already heavily used by institutional investors. CJNK is becoming a cost-friendly alternative to the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE:JNK). JNK, the second-largest high-yield corporate bond ETF, is heavily used by institutional investors and charges 0.40 percent per year. Last year, State Street introduced the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM) as cheaper alternative to the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD). The strategy is proving effective. GLDM charges 0.18 percent per year and has amassed $639 million in assets since coming to market last June, making it one of the most successful ETFs that debuted last year. For its part, CJNK has some work to do to climb the ranks of junk bond ETFs as the fund has just $71.63 million in assets, but with the new fee of 0.15 percent, CJNK will be the cheapest junk bond ETF on the market by five basis points. What's Next Speaking of JNK, State Street said that ETF will be reverse split on April by a 1:3 ratio. The issuer expects the split to increase JNK's price to around $105, helping lower trading costs for clients using that fund.

2019-04-17,Emerging Markets Are On A Gold Buying Spree,"Emerging markets are scooping up gold, and it could be good news for gold prices and investors. The Numbers Recent data from The People’s Bank of China indicates China boosted its gold reserves to 60.62 million ounces during the month of March, up from 60.26Moz in February. Over the past four months, China has upped its gold reserves by a total of 42.9 tons. At the same time, Russia is also beefing up its gold holdings. The World Gold Council reports that Russia bought about 274 tons of gold bullion in 2018 valued at about $11 billion. In February 2019, Russia singlehandedly accounted for 1 million ounces of gold demand, roughly 6 percent of the world’s total demand. In addition, demand for gold in India is expected to get a boost from the upcoming wedding season. Gold is traditionally a popular wedding gift in India, host to roughly 20 million weddings per year with guest lists commonly in the 3,000- to 6,000-person range. Gold Demand Drivers Experts say U.S. dollar weakness is one of the key drivers of gold demand in emerging markets in recent months. In addition, downward revisions to global growth forecasts and increasingly dovish central banks is creating demand for risk-averse asset classes. “The recent revision of the global growth forecast to 3.5 per cent, from 3.7 per cent, by IMF further made investors watch out for the yellow metal and other risk investment assets,” Vinod Jayakumar of Karvy Commodities recently said. For investors in gold ETFs such as the SPDR Gold ETF (NYSE:GLD), emerging market investments could help drive prices even higher. The price of gold is up 5.2 percent in the past six months to $1,276, but Goldman Sachs recently forecast that gold prices will hit $1,450 within the next year.

2019-04-18,This Day In Market History: FDR Takes US Off The Gold Standard,"Each day, Benzinga takes a look back at a notable market-related moment that occurred on this date. What Happened? On this day in 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt took the U.S. dollar off of the gold standard. Where The Market Was The Dow finished the day at 62.65. The S&P 500 traded at around 7.8. Today, the Dow is trading at 26,449 and the S&P 500 is trading at 2,900. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 1933, the Great Depression unemployment rate peaked at 25.2 percent. Adolf Hitler rose to power and became chancellor of Germany. A can of Campbell’s vegetable soup cost 10 cents. The End Of The Gold Standard Until 1933, the value of the U.S. dollar had been directly linked to gold. In the past, countries have used a gold standard system to provide tangible value for their currencies by setting a fixed price for conversion between currency and gold. When the Great Depression hit, both the U.S. and Britain were still using the gold standard system. The U.K. dropped the gold standard in 1931, and the U.S. followed suit in 1933 as deflationary pressures continued to mount. On April 18, 1933, FDR announced that he planned to issue an executive order placing embargoes on exports of U.S. gold and freeing the U.S. dollar to float in value against foreign currencies. This announcement effectively took the U.S. off of the gold standard. FRD hoped that the executive order would reduce the amount of gold that was being hoarded by U.S. citizens and help improve bank liquidity. At the time, the move away from the gold standard was only seen as a temporary one, but the U.S. never went back.

2019-06-03,Gold's Resurgence Felt By These Leveraged ETFs,"With riskier assets taking a beating last month, safe havens benefited, including gold. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed exchange traded fund, jumped 2.43 percent in May while equity benchmarks stumbled. What Happened Gold's May rebound, which took the yellow metal above the $1,300 per ounce level, lifted gold miners stocks and the related ETFs. After gaining nearly 4 percent last Friday, the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDMNTR) finished May up 5.21 percent. Leveraged gold miners ETFs joined the party. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:NUGT), which is designed to deliver triple the daily returns of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, soared more than 17 percent last week, including a gain of 12.15 percent last Friday on volume that was nearly double the daily average. Why It's Important The small-cap Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:JNUG) got in on the act as well. JNUG jumped 15.80 percent last week with most of those gains coming by way of an 11 percent pop on Friday. JNUG looks to deliver triple the daily returns of the MVIS Global Junior Gold Miners Index (MVGDXJTR). With gold having cleared the psychologically important $1,300 level and June historically tough on stocks, NUGT and JNUG have the potential to deliver more near-term upside. “Gold climbed to a seven-week high on Friday, and was headed for its first monthly gain in four weeks, as investors scurried into the safe-haven bullion following Washington’s shock threat of tariffs on Mexico, which heightened fears of a global downturn,” reports CNBC. What's Next If this gold rally proves credible, what could be next for NUGT and JNUG could be more inflows. Data suggest some traders are already moving into the leveraged gold miners ETFs. For the five days ending May 30, traders allocated $11.86 million to the small-cap JNUG, good for the third-biggest total among Direxion ETFs during those five days, according to issuer data. For the 10 days ending May 30, JNUG and NUGT added about $31 million combined in new assets, putting both ETFs among the top Direxion funds for inflows during that time frame.

2019-06-19,Federal Reserve Leaves Rates Unchanged; Bullard Dissents,"In a move that was widely expected, the Federal Reserve opted not to cut interest rates on Wednesday. The decision comes just six weeks after the Fed said the U.S. economy is solid and the labor market remains strong. “In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective,” the Fed said in a statement. The Fed reiterated its previous position that the U.S. labor market is strong and jobs growth is solid, but it does anticipate a rate cut coming in 2020. A minority (seven out of 17 Fed officials) do see interest rates falling 0.5% by the end of 2019. Eight of the nine members voted against a June rate cut, with St. Louis Fed chair James Bullard representing the lone dissenting vote. The Federal Reserve chose once again to reject calls by President Donald Trump to cut interest rates. “Well, let’s see what he does,” Trump said Tuesday when asked whether or not he plans to remove Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell from his position. Global Slowdown The Fed decision comes after several prominent economic forecasters have slashed 2019 global growth rates. In April, the International Monetary Fund cut its 2019 global growth forecast from 3.5% to 3.3%. The IMF specifically mentioned international trade disputes as a headwind to global economic growth. In March, the European Central Bank cut its 2019 economic growth forecast for the Eurozone from 1.7% to 1.1% and announced a third round of bank stimulus that will begin in September and run through March 2021. Markets React U.S. stocks were trading flat ahead of the Fed announcement on Wednesday morning after data from the Commerce Department last week revealed U.S. retail sales in May rose 0.5% despite a deepening trade war with China. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) traded slightly higher after the Fed announcement reassured investors that the economy is on solid footing and the Fed is willing to act with rate cuts in the near future if needed. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds rose slightly higher on Wednesday to 2.084%, near its lowest level since late 2016.

2019-06-20,Big Agnico Eagle Option Trades Could Signal Institutional Interest,"Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM) shares are up 7% over the past week as international trade tensions have driven gold prices higher. The stock traded higher by another 3.3 percent on Thursday, and some unusually large option trades on Thursday morning could suggest a trader with deep pockets is hedging a massive bullish bet on Agnico Eagle. The Trades On Thursday morning, Benzinga Pro subscribers received four options alerts related to Agnico Eagle. At 11:13 a.m., a trader sold 1,378 Agnico Eagle call options at a $44 strike price that expire on Aug. 16. The calls were sold at the bid price of $6.276 and represent an $864,832 bearish bet on Agnico Eagle shares. About seven minutes later, a series of three additional Agnico Eagle call sales were completed within 15 seconds. Likely the same trader sold another 1,863 of the same August $44 Agnico Eagle call options at bid prices of between $6.27 and $6.35. The three sales represented an additional bearish bet worth more than $1.16 million. All together, the total value of all the Agnico Eagle calls dumped on Thursday morning totals more than $2 million. Why It’s Important Due to the relatively complex nature of the options market, options traders are generally considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader. In addition, large options traders are often professional, wealthy individuals or institutions, either of which could have unique insight or information about a company. Even traders that stick exclusively to stocks watch the option market closely for unusual trading activity as an indicator of where the “smart money” is focusing. Unfortunately, because stock investors often use put options to hedge larger bullish stock positions, there’s no way to be 100% certain whether an option trade is a standalone purchase or a hedge against a stock position. Given the large size of the call sales on Thursday morning and the fact they seem to have been broken up strategically into smaller lots, there’s a good chance at least some of them were institutional hedges, suggesting all the call selling may not be as bearish as it seems. In fact, there have been several bullish developments for Agnico Eagle in the past month. First, the company announced on May 30 it reached commercial production at its Meliadine mine. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is also up 9% since May 1 as investors have flocked to gold as a safe-haven investment in an environment of slowing global economic growth and ramping trade tensions between the U.S. and China. If Thursday’s Agnico Eagle option sales are, in fact, a hedge against a bullish position in the stock, the institutional investor may be betting on further global economic turmoil driving golf prices even higher over the next couple of months. Finally, Agnico Eagle is scheduled to report earnings on July 24, ahead of the expiration date of these call options. Thursday’s trader may simply be hedging a bullish bet that Agnico will exceed market expectations for the quarter. The stock traded around $49.96 at time of publication.

2019-06-21,Peter Schiff Says Fed Is Doubling Down On Bad Policy: 'It's Obvious That We're Heading To Recession',"Peter Schiff, the CEO and and chief global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, pulled no punches at the Benzinga Trading Summit on Thursday in New York City. To understand today's financial climate, it's best to examine the dot-com crisis of the 1990s, he said. That excess liquidity fueled a stock market bubble which popped in 2000, 2001. But instead of learning its lesson and not repeating its mistakes, the Fed did what governments often do, and it just doubled down on his failed policies, said Schiff. Schiff: Fed Caused Great Recession This approach led to further adverse effects, Schiff told the conference. Those consequences were the 2008 financial crisis. The Fed caused that. That great recession that we had was because we kept interest rates lower for longer, and during that time we made many more mistakes that needed to be corrected. The Fed's mistakes worsened over time, according to Schiff. Only this time they didn't take rates down to 1%. They took them all the way to zero and they left them there for like six, seven years. And after three years or so of trying to normalize rates, they stopped it at 2.25 to 2.5% and now we're going back to zero, he said. The Trump Factor President Donald Trump's role has been to make a bubble bigger. We have bigger budget deficits now than we've ever had before, Schiff said. In fact, we're running larger deficits today when the economy is supposedly still growing than we did during the worst part of the Great Recession. We have the worst trade deficits in U.S. history today. The combination of enormous trade and budget deficits are evidence that the U.S. does not have a strong economy, he said. If you look at all the economic data, it's obvious that we're heading to recession. The Federal Reserve denied the country was heading into a recession in 2008, Schiff told the Trading Summit — he expects the central bank will pretend everything is great when interest rates are once again reduced. “But this is not a one-time thing. This next cut — this is simply the first step on the road back to zero, and it's not just a return to zero, it's going to be a return to quantitative easing.” Related Links: Interest Rates, Gold, Trade: Benzinga Trading Summit Panelists On Where The Market Is Headed Peter Schiff: Bitcoin Is 'The Biggest Bubble I Have Ever Seen' Peter Schiff at the Benzinga Trading Summit on Thursday, June 20 at the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel.

2019-06-25,"'Fast Money' Traders Talk Gold, Defensive Stocks And More","On CNBC’s “Fast Money” on Monday, Guy Adami said gold mining stocks like SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) are breaking out to the upside and continue to have room to run. Tim Seymour added that typical risk-aversion stocks like McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are defensive stocks that are likely going higher and that valuations don't matter. Dan Nathan said with gold and defensive stocks moving higher, the warning signs are screaming in silence and said if the market is going to breakout to meaningful highs, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc.

2019-07-11,The Other Precious Metals ETF That's Soaring,"As is usually the case when discussing precious metals, gold and the related exchange traded funds are dominating the conversation this year. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed ETF, is up 10.38% year to date and resides just below its recently set 52-week high. What Happened While gold and the related ETFs are deserving of the accolades, the real winners in the precious metals space this year are palladium and the Aberdeen Standard Physical Palladium Shares ETF (NYSE:PALL). PALL, the largest U.S.-listed palladium ETF, is up more than 26% this year, or more than double the gains offered by rival gold funds. Why It's Important “But gold has not been the shiniest precious metal this year; back in January, palladium became the most expensive precious metal for the first time since 2002, and by July 8, 2019, it had reached USD 1,542 per troy ounce, a premium of almost USD 150 to gold,” said S&P Dow Jones Indices in a recent research note. Palladium's dominance is important for other reasons, including the fact that is not usually viewed as safe-haven asset as is the case with gold. Rather, palladium is one of the more volatile metals, due in large part to the global automobile industry being one of the metal's primary sources of demand. “Approximately 80% of palladium demand comes from the automotive industry,” said S&P Dow Jones. “Its other uses include electronics, dentistry, and jewelry. As regulations on emissions have tightened, demand for palladium to be used in the catalytic converters of gasoline-powered vehicles has risen.” What's Next While automobile demand is integral to the palladium demand equation, investors considering PALL should also examine the production situations in Russia and South Africa, the dominant players in the global palladium market. “Palladium prices spiked in March 2019 when Russia’s Ministry of Industry and Trade announced it was considering a temporary ban on the export of precious metal scrap and tailings, while in South Africa, the world’s largest platinum miners are about to embark on a series of wage negotiations with unions, which in the past have led to lengthy mine strikes,” according to S&P Dow Jones.

2019-07-22,Ray Dalio's 10-Year Bull Case For Gold,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) has rallied 37.5% in the past three years, while the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) has significantly lagged, gaining just 5.7% in that time. However, Bridgewater Associates hedge fund manager Ray Dalio recently said gold could be gearing up for a bug decade of returns. Paradigm Shift In a LinkedIn post last week, Dalio discussed paradigm shifts in financial markets. He said these shifts tend to occur once every decade or so, and the price of gold tends to correlate with the shifts. Gold outperformed in the 1970s after President Richard Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard. In the 1980s and 1990s, gold lagged while the S&P 500 gained 2,500%. In the early 2000s prior to the financial crisis, gold tripled in value. From 2008 to 2010, gold prices gained just 10%. Today, Dalio sees another paradigm shift in global economics. He said massive sovereign debt loads will ultimately force central banks to print more money, which will make dealing with their debt loads more manageable. Given gold is a global store of value and has a limited supply, he said investors and central banks will likely view it as an effective hedge against currency inflation. 'Risky Assets' Dalio said the world is currently positioned extremely long on “risky assets,” such as stocks, leveraged private equity and venture capital. He said these assets are providing historically low returns relative to cash. “I think these are unlikely to be good real returning investments and that those that will most likely do best will be those that do well when the value of money is being depreciated and domestic and international conflicts are significant, such as gold,” Dalio wrote. “I believe that it would be both risk-reducing and return-enhancing to consider adding gold to one’s portfolio.” Theory Holds Water DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas said gold pays no dividends, but it is an effective hedge against the dollar. In that context, Colas said Dalio’s bullish thesis on gold makes a lot of sense. “Central banks are therefore a natural buyer, and they have begun increasing their holdings but have plenty more firepower to add to this trade,” he said. In the past three months, Dalio’s thesis seems to be playing out on the market. The GLD fund is up 11.9%, while the SPY ETF is up just 2.7% overall.

2019-07-25,Rate Cut Minus Recession Equals More Market Gains,"The next FOMC meeting is now less than a week away, and investors are extremely confident an interest rate is coming. The stock market has a history of mixed returns following Fed rate cuts, but rate cuts that happen when the U.S. economy is not in a recession have historically been a major bullish indicator for stock prices. Market Expecting Cut Every single time the Fed has cut rates during a period of U.S. economic expansion, the S&P 500 has delivered positive returns over the next 12 months. In fact the S&P 500 has averaged a 16.5% gain during those periods. Investors are extremely confident they will get the magic combo of economic expansion and falling interest rates next week. The bond market is currently pricing in a 100% chance of at least a 0.25% rate cut next week and a 21.4% chance of a 0.5% cut, according to the CME Group FedWatch Tool. Once interest rates start falling, the only thing that could rain on investors’ parade is the economy. The New York Fed’s recession probability index recently hit 32.9%, by far its highest level since the highest level since the last U.S. recession in 2009. The index suggests there is nearly a one-in-three chance of a U.S. economic recession within the next year. The S&P 500 is already up 20.4% year to date to new all-time highs of 3,020. The index has already hit LPL Financial chief investment strategist John Lynch’s year-end target, but he said this week investors shouldn’t be dumping stocks just yet. “Even though fundamentals may not justify the market going much above our 3,000 forecast on the S&P 500, with the Fed tailwind behind us, we’ll ride the wave for now,” Lynch wrote. Golden Opportunity? While an interest rate cut may be good news for stock investors, it could also be good news for gold investors. “Low to negative rates suggest falling cost of holding gold at a time when elevated trade and geopolitical uncertainty strengthen the case for diversification,” UBS analyst Joni Teves recently said. UBS is calling for gold prices to rise from around $1,423 today to $1,450 by the end of the year. Investors who expect a rate cut next week and believe the markets will follow their historical patterns should keep an eye on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD).

2019-07-25,7 Things To Know Before Investing In Bitcoin,"Over the last three years, bitcoin has become a household word in the financial community. The cryptocurrency rose from an obscure curiosity within the tech world to a popular investment and topic of debate on Wall Street. Some investors even consider bitcoin to be a safe haven investment, similar to gold. Here are seven things to know before you invest. 1. Bitcoin’s Origins Are Unclear Bitcoin was created in 2008 by a person or persons using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto reportedly published the proof of concept for bitcoin in a cryptocurrency mailing list before leaving the project to other developers. The cryptocurrency community has several theories about Nakamoto’s identity, but they remain unconfirmed to this day. 2. Bitcoin Is Pseudoanonymous One reason bitcoin has become so popular: users can send and receive cash without ever using any personally identifiable information. Yet each bitcoin transaction is logged along with an address that is forever linked to that transaction. If users use the same address for multiple transactions, all the transactions are linked together. If a person’s connection to that address is ever leaked or discovered, all of his or her transactions will be revealed. 3. Bitcoin Is Decentralized In contrast to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar and the Chinese yuan, bitcoin is decentralized, meaning it's not controlled by a central government or other entity. The pros of a decentralized system include the idea that cryptocurrencies can’t be seized or devalued by a central authority. The cons of decentralization include the fact that there is no government or other entity backing the value of the currency — and there is nothing limiting access or use of the cryptocurrency. This lack of access, coupled with the pseudoanonymous nature of bitcoin, has led to a surge in criminal activity. 4. Bitcoin Is A Real Currency Despite its decentralized nature, bitcoin is a real currency in the sense that users can use it to easily buy goods and services. Companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Expedia Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Newegg are among the companies that accept direct bitcoin payment. 5. Bitcoin Investors Have Limited Options Unfortunately, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other financial regulators globally have been extremely cautious when it comes to cryptocurrency investments. The SEC has repeatedly denied and delayed applications for a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, citing concerns over investor safety and lack of market liquidity. Today, bitcoin investors must get creative by either buying it directly from a cryptocurrency exchange like Coinbase; from a broker like Robinhood; trading Bitcoin futures; or buying bitcoin from other sources, such as cryptocurrency ATMs. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) is also an option, but it's not approved by the SEC and does not trade on a major U.S. exchange. 6. Bitcoin Is Extremely Volatile Bitcoin investors often compare the cryptocurrency to gold as a safe haven and hedge against fiat currency inflation. In reality, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and unpredictable in the near term. The 30-day rolling volatility of the GBTC fund is 125.2% compared to 16.7% for the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and just 7.6% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). 7. Bitcoin Has Some Powerful Critics Investors buying bitcoin are going against the advice of some extremely powerful voices on Wall Street. Warren Buffett has called Bitcoin a “mirage” and “rat poison squared.” Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said Bitcoin is a “highly speculative asset” and “not a stable store of value.” President Donald Trump recently said he is “not a fan” of bitcoin and said its value is “based on thin air.” Bitcoin was trading at $10,096 at the time of publication Thursday.

2019-07-30,Todd Gordon's SPDR Gold Trust Trade,"On CNBC's Trading Nation, Todd Gordon suggested a bullish options trade in SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The stock has been moving higher lately and he wants to buy the strength. Gordon thinks that SPDR Gold Trust could move to 143.50 and he wants to use options to make a bullish trade. Specifically, he wants to buy the Oct. 135/145 call spread for $2.28. The trade breaks even at $137.28 or 1.7% above the current stock price. If the stock moves to $145 or higher at the October expiration, the trade is going to reach its maximal profit of $7.72. Gordon wants to use a stop loss and close the trade if the price of the spread drops 50%."
2019-07-31,Already Hot Gold ETFs Can Keep It Going In August,"With today being the last trading day of July, it's a good time to consider seasonal trading ideas for August. Fortunately, traders don't have to veer into the unfamiliar in search of exchange traded funds with solid August track records. What Happened The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed exchange traded fund, is up 11.32% year to date and 1.34% this month, gains that could be extended if GLD lives up to its historical August form. Over the past decade “GLD has ended the month in positive territory 80% of the time, and has averaged a gain of 3.1%,” according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. For the 10 Augusts spanning 2009 through 2018, GLD finished higher eight out of 10 times. Why It's Important Seasonal trends are great, but the more obvious catalyst for GLD and rival gold ETFs this week is the Federal Reserve meeting. GLD's performance this month is impressive considering the dollar is higher, too. If the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, that could weaken the greenback, boosting dollar-denominated commodities in the process. Additionally, lower interest rates boost the allure of gold because bullion doesn't pay a coupon or a dividend, meaning investors are entirely dependent on capital appreciation. “A move higher of similar magnitude a month out would send the ETF barreling past its July 19 high of $136.63 and just south of $139, territory not seen since 2013. GLD has relied on Fed news of rate cuts to move higher this summer, with pullbacks finding support at its ascending 20-day moving average,” according to Schaeffer's. What's Next In terms of average August gains, the best ETF over the past decade, though its win rate has been lower is the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). SLV, the largest silver ETF, averages an August gain of 3.48%. For much of this year, silver has been lagging gold, but SLV is shedding that laggard status in a big way on the back of a July gain that is over 8% with just one trading day left in the month. Of the 13 best ETFs in August over the past decade, five are commodities funds or equity funds with commodities exposure.

2019-08-05,Market Sell-Off Accelerates Following China Trade War Retaliation,"The S&P 500 continued its trade war slide on Monday, falling more than 2% after China retaliated to the latest round of tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump. China Retaliates Bloomberg reported China has halted all purchases of U.S. agricultural products. The retaliation from China comes after Trump threatened last week to once again ramp up his trade war with China by implementing a 10% tariff on an additional $300 billion of Chinese goods starting on Sept. 1. He said U.S. representatives are having constructive trade talks with China but once again blamed China for backing out of a potential deal three months ago. “More recently, China agreed to...buy agricultural product from the U.S. in large quantities, but did not do so. Additionally, my friend President Xi said that he would stop the sale of Fentanyl to the United States – this never happened, and many Americans continue to die!” Trump wrote. China is reportedly once again targeting American farmers in retaliation to Trump’s tariffs. Last week, Trump issued a $16 billion government bailout package to help support struggling farmers. See Also: 10% Tariffs Could Be Delayed, Halted If China Talks Action Before Sept. 1 Currency War The escalation of the trade war has slammed financial markets in the past three days In addition to the retaliation against U.S. agriculture, China also allowed the yuan to devalue to above the 7-per-dollar level on Monday for the first time in more than 10 years. The move is the first indication that China may be willing to allow the trade dispute to expand into a currency war as well. A weaker yuan versus the dollar makes it cheaper for U.S. companies to purchase Chinese goods, undermining Trump’s import tariffs. The past week is not the first time trade relations between the U.S. and China have taken a negative turn, but investors are certainly taking the latest breakdown seriously. Questionable Strategy On Monday morning, Frank Lavin, U.S. ambassador to Singapore, told CNBC a trade deal between the U.S. and China in 2019 now appears “unlikely.” Lavin questioned Trump’s approach of publicly attacking China and making demands and threats on Twitter. “When he is publicly triumphant, when he publicly is chastising, publicly finger pointing, he’s not giving them space,” Lavin said. Trump reportedly implemented the latest round of 10% tariffs against the advice of his closest advisors. The Wall Street Journal reported that nearly his entire trade team was against the idea of the new tariffs during a recent White House meeting. Shares of U.S. giant Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are down 8% since Trump announced his newest tariffs on July 31. The Wall Street Journal has reported those fears may be founded. While iPhones lost market share in China in the second quarter, Chinese device maker Huawei’s market share increased by almost a third to a record 38%. Earlier this year, Trump placed Huawei on a U.S. trade blacklist due to security concerns. Worst-Case Scenario Bank of America analyst Claudio Piron told CNBC Monday morning the trade war is turning into a worst-case scenario. “I think our worst fears are now kind of borne through because China is now stating that it’s really going through the cold calculus of saying what are the offsetting depreciation to offset the tariffs, and I think this is clearly a retaliation that in the past China has refrained from doing,” Piron said. Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial, said the market weakness is a clear response to the trade breakdown. “Any hopes of a quick resolution with China are fading quickly. Tariffs, slowing economic data, and a more hawkish Fed are all contributing to this weakness,” Detrick said. See Also: What Is A Tariff And What Does It Do?

2019-08-07,Bitcoin Vs. Gold: Which Is A Better Safe Haven Right Now?,"The recent market volatility and fears over a potential currency war between the U.S. and China have investors looking for a safe place to stash their cash while they wait out a period of uncertainty. Traditionally, gold has been a popular safe haven for investors, but some cryptocurrency traders point to Bitcoin’s recent gains as evidence that it is now the best alternative to stocks and the U.S. dollar. Correlation Matrix So far in 2019, the S&P 500, gold, the U.S. dollar and Bitcoin have all been performing relatively well. Even after the recent sell-off, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is up 14.3% year-to-date. The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (Btc) (OTC:GBTC) is up 284.6%, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 16.6% and the INVESCO DB USD /BULLISH FD (NYSE:UUP) is up 3.8%. It’s not surprising to see these investments trending higher in 2019 given the relative health of the U.S. economy. Now that the market has hit a bump in the road, day traders are looking much more closely at short-term correlations. The Portfolio Visualizer daily return correlation matrix for the funds mentioned above gives traders a rough understanding of how stocks, gold, bitcoin and the U.S. dollar trade relative to each other on a daily basis dating back to 2015. The correlation ranges from 1.0 for perfect positive correlation to negative 1.0 for perfect negative correlation. The Numbers The strongest correlation is the negative 0.48 correlation between the GLD and the UUP. That negative correlation makes perfect sense because the higher the price of gold goes, the less gold investors will be able to buy for a dollar. In that sense, gold remains a good hedge for investors who fear inflation and/or a currency war that would devalue the dollar. The GLD also has a slightly negative 0.15 correlation with the SPY as well. Gold tends to trade higher on days where the stock market is weak, but the correlation is small. In other words, gold is not a great hedge for falling stock prices, but it is a good safe haven for preserving value. The GBTC correlations also reveal some interesting trends. Bitcoin has almost no correlation to stocks, the U.S. dollar or even gold. The good news for bitcoin buyers is that no correlation means the cryptocurrency trades completely independently from other asset classes, including fiat currencies and stocks. The bad news is that Bitcoin is still extremely volatile, creating high risk for traders even in the short-term. The Bitcoin Volatility Index has averaged 5.3% over the past 60 days. Catching bitcoin on a bad day could easily result in a loss even bigger than the 4% drop in the SPY ETF over the past week. And The Winner Is … A lack of correlation with other assets suggests Bitcoin could have a powerful place in upping the diversification of a long-term investment portfolio. Until volatility in the cryptocurrency market drops dramatically, there is simply too much risk on a day-to-day basis for it to serve as a practical safe haven during periods of dollar or stock market weakness. In the meantime, gold will likely remain the best and most popular hedge against a currency war and a stock market sell-off.

2019-08-08,Trump Again Calls For 'Substantial Fed Cuts' In Series Of Tweets,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is down more than 2% so far in the month of August after President Donald Trump threatened to impose new 10% tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports not already covered under the existing tariffs. In retaliation, China has halted all purchases of U.S. agricultural products and has allowed the yuan to devalue to 10-year lows against the U.S. dollar to offset the impact of the tariffs. Trump Blames Fed Trump again took to Twitter on Thursday morning, blaming the Federal Reserve for what he says is an unfair competitive landscape for U.S. businesses. Despite the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates by 0.25% on July 31, Trump said Thursday American companies like Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) can’t compete internationally when the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates and the value of the dollar high. “We have the greatest companies...in the world, there is nobody even close, but unfortunately the same cannot be said of our Federal Reserve,” Trump tweeted, adding that “substantial Fed cuts” would make it possible for American companies “to win against any competition.” As your President, one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. I am not! The Fed’s high interest rate level, in comparison to other countries, is keeping the dollar high, making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like Caterpillar, Boeing,..... — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 8, 2019 See Also: What Happens When A Country Manipulates Its Currency? Role Of Rate Cuts Historically, the Federal Reserve has typically only issued interest rate cuts during periods of U.S. economic contraction. Yet despite 16.6% year-to-date gains for U.S. stocks, GDP growth exceeding expectations at 2.1% in the second quarter and interest rates well below previous bull market peaks, the Fed opted to cut rates in July for the first time since 2008. Interest rate cuts have historically been the Federal Reserve’s first line of defense against a U.S. recession, while rate hikes are a guard against out-of-control inflation. “They have called it wrong at every step of the way, and we are still winning,” Trump said of the Fed. “Can you imagine what would happen if they actually called it right?” Fed Chair Jerome Powell has been under fire from the White House ever since Trump appointed him in November 2017. Former Chairs Respond Trump’s unprecedented attacks on the Fed prompted former Fed chairs Paul Volcker, Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen to co-write an op-ed piece for the Wall Street Journal this week highlighting the importance of an independent central bank. Together the four chairs served 40 years at the position of Fed chair and were appointed and reappointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents. “As former chairs of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, we are united in the conviction that the Fed and its chair must be permitted to act independently and in the best interests of the economy, free of short-term political pressures and, in particular, without the threat of removal or demotion of Fed leaders for political reasons,” the former chairs wrote. The market initially reacted positively to Trump’s calls for more rate cuts. The SPY ETF was higher by 1.37% in mid-day trading, and each of the stocks Trump mentioned traded higher following his tweets. The iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index (NYSE:FXI) also traded higher by 0.5% on Thursday, while the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up just 0.2% on the day."

Tariffs on the exempted items do not go into effect until Dec. 15. Exempted Items The USTR said cell phones and other electronic devices, including laptops, video game consoles and computer monitors, are also exempt until December. Certain articles of clothing and most footwear is also clear for another four months. Tariffs will be delayed for certain chemicals, household glassware and silverware, microwaves, jewelry, and sporting equipment as well. Apple wasn’t the only stock rallying on the tariff delay.

Trump said he delayed the tariffs on certain goods due to concerns about them impacting Christmas shopping season.

2019-08-15,Gold ETFs Are Still Worth It,"Most of the exchange traded funds that hit 52-week highs on Thursday were newer products or fixed income funds, but outside of those groups, a slew of gold ETFs, including the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) joined the party. What Happened GLD, the world's largest ETF backed by physical holdings of gold, is higher by about 8% this month and more than 17% year to date. By the day, it seems like positive catalysts mount for gold and the related ETFs. Whether it's investors' desire for safer assests, a world awash in low and negative interest rates or central banks gobbling up gold, bullion's rally is credible and based on solid fundamentals. Plus, gold isn't vulnerable to the US/China trade spat. It's a beneficiary of that controversy. “US-China trade negotiations continue to be a random walk,” said State Street in a recent note. “The threat of tariffs and Chinese Yuan devaluation point to a prolonged environment of trade and economic uncertainty. The US-China trade relationship impacts a broad range of US businesses and their overseas operations, driving market sentiment.” Why It's Important Data confirm investors are embracing gold. In the second quarter, GLD saw inflows of more than $526 million while the fund's low-cost counterpart, the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM), added nearly $83 million. Since the start of the current quarter, investors have allocated $2.32 billion to GLD while GLDM has taken in nearly $67 million. GLDM is just over a year old and nearly has $1 billion in assets under management, easily making it one of the most successful commodities ETFs to come to market since the start of 2018. “Gold typically performs well when volatility spikes. Gold has appreciated +6.7% on average during the last nine market downturns, while the S&P 500 has pulled back an average of -13.3%,” according to State Street. “That same trend has continued so far this year, as gold prices broke through the psychological 1,500/oz. barrier on the back of persistent geopolitical tensions and real interest rates turning negative.” What's Next Speaking of interest rates, which are declining throughout much of the world, that's a legitimate catalyst for GLD and friends. “Gold has historically had a negative relationship to real rates,” said State Street. “Both factors may continue to support gold prices. The rate environment is unlikely to change, given the stance by multiple central banks to lower rates and turn policy overly accommodative to combat sluggish global growth concerns.” Related Links: The Other Yield Move To Watch An International ETF For Skittish Investors"

2019-08-29,Gold's Rally Has Miners ETFs Strutting Their Bull Market Stuff,"Gold's recent rally is providing predictable benefits to some other popular exchange traded funds, those being miners products, including the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). What Happened Bullion is being bolstered by global central banks on multiple fronts. Not only are central banks, in both developed and emerging markets, seemingly racing to lower interest rates, many of those banks are also gobbling up gold. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest ETF backed by physical holdings of gold, is indeed in a bull market and that status is important. “Bull markets can be classified as either secular (long term) or cyclical (bull phases within an overall bear market),” said VanEck in a recent note. “Before its $1,400 per ounce breakout in June, gold appeared to be tracking, on a technical basis, similar to its 36-month cyclical bull market from 1993 to 1996. However, its current $1,500 price level hints at a potentially longer, sustained rally—perhaps more similar to the secular gold bull market of 2001 to 2008.” Why It's Important Not all gold rallies are met with corresponding upside by ETFs like GDX, but this time is proving different because miners have worked through balance sheet issues that plagued the group several years ago and have diligently reined in costs. Those catalysts along with some valuations that still reside on the more attractive side of the ledger powering GDX and rival ETFs higher. Over the past 90 days, GLD is higher by 19.3%, but GDX is outperforming the bullion-backed fund by a margin of roughly 2.5-to-1 over that span, indicating that if this gold bull market is potentially long-lasting, GDX's year-to-date gain of 44.7% could be the start, rather than the end of something. “Gold stocks, on average, have historically outperformed gold during gold bull market cycles in the past—including through both cyclical and secular periods,” according to VanEck. “This typically occurs because of their optionality to gold through earnings and resource leverage.” What's Next As for what's next for the miners, the aforementioned moves to shore up balance sheets by paring leverage could bode well for the group's fortunes should gold remain in bull market. “For senior or mid-tier miners, these efforts could translate to nearly 60% increases in free cash flow, on average, for a gold price move from $1,400 to $1,600,” said VanEck. “We believe that this makes a compelling case for gold stocks at the moment and, in particular, given their attractive valuation on both an absolute and relative basis.” Related Links: A Virtuous Bond ETF Inside High Dividend ETFs"

2019-10-01,A Cheap Gold ETF Joins The $1B Club,"In 2019, no one should need any convincing that advisors and investors love cheap exchange traded funds. Usually, it's a case of “the cheaper, the better.” What Happened For the uninitiated, the latest example of cheap works is the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM). GLDM, came to market in June as a cost-effective alternative to the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), recently topped $1 billion in assets under management. Thanks to that low fee and soaring gold prices, GLDM has attracted nearly $520 million in assets, or about half its AUM tally, just this year. Why It's Important “Our low-cost gold ETF with a share price hovering around $15, GLDM has resonated with financial advisors, digital advice platforms and buy-and-hold retail investors,” said Matthew Bartolini, Head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors, in a statement. With an annual fee of 0.18%, or $18 on a $10,000 investment, GLDM is significantly cheaper than GLD. GLD, the world's largest gold ETF, charges 0.40% per year. Just two U.S.-listed gold ETFs – the Aberdeen Standard Physical Swiss Gold Shares ETF (NYSE:SGOL) and the Graniteshares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR) – have lower annual fees than GLDM. Those funds charge 0.17% per year. What's Next Considering it's still a fairly new entrant to the gold ETF fray, GLDM's average daily volume of 1.35 million shares is robust, helping keep bid-ask spreads tight and trading costs low for investors. If there's one knock on GLDM, it's that the fund is not yet optionable. GLD is. “GLD remains the largest and most liquid gold ETF in the market with approximately $43.2 billion in total net assets and $5.23 billion of net new inflows year-to-date,” according to State Street.

2019-10-08,"With So Many ETFs Now Free To Trade, Liquidity And Trading Costs Still Need To Be Evaluated","Last week, several online brokers like Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) made waves by eliminating commissions on options, individual stocks and exchange traded funds. In other words, gone are the days of talking about brokers' various commission-free ETF offerings because, well, now they're all free. What Happened Some ETF issuers believe further democratization of investing — and that's exactly what eliminating commissions is — could increase liquidity for some ETFs. When it comes to ETFs, expense ratios, which have been broadly decreasing, are only part of the total cost of ownership equation. “Trading costs are an important factor to consider,” said State Street, the company behind the SPDR ETFs. “ETFs with high trading volumes tend to have tight bid-ask spreads that can reduce trading costs and lower your total cost of ownership (TCO).” See Also: How And Why Are Online Brokers Offering Commission-Free Trades? Why It's Important Previously, many high profile, highly liquid ETFs were not part of commission-free platforms. In the case of SPDR funds, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) and the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), just to name a pair, weren't part of commission-free platforms because brokers didn't want to lose revenue from those heavily traded funds. State Street compared liquidity in SPDR ETFs trading on Schwab's and TD Ameritrade's commission-free ETF platforms prior to the outright elimination of commissions on all ETFs. The findings were interesting, if not unsurprising. “It is significant that the total average daily trading volume for our funds that previously did not trade commission-free is $35.4 billion versus less than $1 billion for the commission free-style funds,” said the issuer. What's Next Although commissions are out the door and that's good for investors, ETF users still need to assess factors such as bid/ask spreads and the dept of the underlying market, be it gold for a fund like GLD or technology stocks for a fund such as the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK). “Just because commissions have dropped across major platforms this doesn’t mean you should throw trading cost considerations or liquidity due diligence by the wayside,” according to State Street. “You still need to evaluate bid-ask spreads and depth of market. Depending on your rebalancing size and frequency, these trading costs can accumulate significantly and have a larger impact on the TCO than any expense ratio difference between two ETFs.”"

2019-10-21,A Holiday Catalyst For Gold ETFs,"Gold is one of this year's best-performing commodities. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed exchange traded fund, confirms as much: it's up nearly 16% in 2019. What Happened A variety of factors are boosting gold prices this year and prompting investors to embrace ETFs such as GLD and the cost-effective SPDR Gold MiniShares (NYSE:GLDM). It's not just the Federal Reserve that's lowering interest rates. A slew of other global central banks are doing the same thing, depressing some currencies and making gold more attractive in the process. And the world is awash in negative-yield debt — as much as $17 trillion by some estimates. With some bonds charging an entry fee, gold, which doesn't pay interest or a dividend, is more attractive to some investors. Why It's Important Another annual catalyst is now in play for gold and ETFs such as GLD and GLDM: the arrival of the Indian holiday Diwali, also known as the festival of lights. Diwali often sparks an uptick in gold imports to India, one of the world's largest buyers of the metal. “Gold tends to shine bright during the second half of the year as demand picks up,” S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a recent note. “It is estimated that Diwali accounts for approximately one-fifth of annual gold purchases in India —more than any other time of the year. Jewelers and gold coin dealers in India frequently see a spike of 20%-30% in sales leading up to the festival.” Diwali comes against the backdrop of increased central bank purchases of bullion and amid expectations that the Fed could lower rates again this month, although the U.S. economy remains solid, with stocks resting near all-time highs. “Gold is the second-largest import in India after crude oil, illustrating how important the country is to the global gold market and likewise how important it is for Indian consumers to appreciate the global supply/demand dynamics of gold,” according to S&P Dow Jones. What's Next Data suggest investors are taking some profits in GLD. After the ETF hauled in $6.04 billion in new assets in the third quarter, it has seen modest fourth-quarter outflows of $124 million. Since the start of the third quarter, GLDM has seen about $241 million in inflows and it recently became a $1-billion ETF. Related Links: Quality ETFs Still Look Strong A Beloved Bond ETF"
2019-10-29,Palladium ETF Continues Pushing Past Precious Metals Rivals,"Lower interest rates and negative-yielding debt around the world are among the factors contributing to investors renewed interest in precious metals and the related exchange traded funds this year. When the conversation on precious metals ETF is reborn, it usually drifts toward funds such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) due to silver's correlations to gold. This year, however, the precious metals competition, both spot prices and ETF performances, is being dominated by palladium and it's not even close. Why It's Important Year to date, the Aberdeen Standard Physical Palladium Shares ETF (NYSE:PALL), which is backed by physical holdings of the white metal, is higher by more than 43%. In a vacuum, that's a stellar performance, but consider the following: The year-to-date performances of GLD, SLV and PALL's stablemate, the Aberdeen Standard Physical Platinum Shares ETF (NYSE:PPLT), need to be combined to exceed PALL's 2019 returns. To be fair, PALL is the most volatile of that quartet of precious metals ETFs, but the palladium fund is topping its rivals by wide enough margins that the extra volatility is worth it. Additionally, a supply shortage coupled with strong demand has made palladium the most expensive precious metal, ahead of gold and even platinum. “Usage is increasing as governments, especially China's, tighten regulations to crack down on pollution from vehicles, forcing automakers to increase the amount of precious metal they use,” according to Bloomberg. “In Europe, consumers bought fewer diesel cars, which mostly use platinum, and instead chose gasoline-powered vehicles, which use palladium, following revelations that makers of diesel cars cheated on emissions tests.” What's Next As for what's next for PALL, perhaps it'll be inflows from late-arriving investors because even with the fund's stellar performance this year, it's trailing GLD, PPLT and SLV in terms of year-to-date inflows. Investors have added a respectable $29.22 million to PALL this year, but that pales in comparison to the $986.23 allocated to SLV and the $6.32 billion that's flowed into GLD. Assuming PALL finishes 2019 outperforming its aforementioned rivals, something that's likely to happen, this market the sixth year in the past seven PALL has been the top performer among the aforementioned precious metals funds.

2019-11-06,ETF Demand Propped Up Gold In Q3,"In the third quarter, gold jewelry demand slumped. So did appetite for bullion bars and coins, but exchange traded funds, such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) picked up the slack. What Happened In a note out Tuesday, the World Gold Council confirmed global gold ETFs offset weakness in the jewelry and bar/coin markets in the July through September time frame. “A surge in ETF inflows (258t) outweighed weakness elsewhere in the market to nudge gold demand 3% higher in Q3,” WGC said. “Although central bank buying remained healthy, it was significantly lower than the record levels of Q3 2018.” Increased demand for gold ETFs in the third quarter came amid a spate of interest rate cuts by global central banks, including two by the Federal Reserve. Lower interest rates boost the allure of gold because the yellow metal doesn't pay interest or coupon payments. Why It's Important In the third quarter, investors allocated $6.04 billion to GLD, by far the largest inflow tally during that period among all commodities ETFs and one of the best hauls of any U.S.-listed ETF regardless of asset class. During the third quarter, gold ETF holdings reached an all-time high. “Holdings grew by 258.2t during the quarter, the highest level of quarterly inflows since Q1 2016. Accommodative monetary policies, along with safe-haven and momentum buying, drove demand,” according to the WGC. GLD wasn't the only beneficiary of that theme. Investors also put money to work with lower-fee gold products, including the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM). GLDM, which recently topped $1 billion in assets under management, saw third-quarter inflows of nearly $215 million. GLDM charges just 0.18% per year, or $18 on a $10,000 investment, compared to 0.40% on GLD. What's Next Although gold's price has recently retreated as investors moved toward riskier assets, the yellow metal could be in for more upside in 2020 as interest rates remain low and if uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 2020 presidential election rises. “The gold price rose by 5% during Q3, finding sustained support around US$1,500/oz,” WGC said. “The primary factors behind this price momentum continued to be ongoing geopolitical tensions, concerns of a slowdown in economic growth, lower interest rates and the level of negative yielding debt.” Related Links: A High-Yield Developed Markets Play 3 Europe ETFs Probing Fresh Highs"

Takeaways From 13F Season Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. Overall, it appears buying and selling among fund managers was split relatively evenly in the third quarter. Surprisingly, despite a 27.1% drop in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares in the third quarter, no major fund manager mentioned below was buying or selling shares. The FANG group didn’t get much attention at all in the third quarter aside from David Tepper buying Facebook, Amazon and Google. Carl Icahn took a gamble on Caesars Entertainment, while George Soros dialed back his position. Several fund managers made major adjustments to their ETF positions, including Tepper selling the XOP ETF, Leon Cooperman buying the GLD ETF, and Soros selling both the QQQ and the IWB funds. As interest rates fell, dividend stocks were getting some love this quarter, with fund managers buying stocks like General Motors, BP and Carnival, each of which yield more than 4%.

2019-11-20,Gold's Recent Malaise Could Spell Opportunity,"Gasp. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed exchange traded fund, is lower by 2.17% in the fourth quarter. What Happened To GLD Some of the air has come out of the gold trade as the dollar has remained peskily sturdy and as investors have gravitated toward riskier assets. Still, there's no denying that GLD is up 14.38% year to date, cementing gold's status as one of this year's best-performing commodities. GLD may have hit a bump in the road as its recent price action suggests, but a broader view of gold suggests the decline isn't likely to be severe and could give way to more upside. “In actuality, there is a confluence of short-term and long-term macroeconomic drivers working together that influence gold’s fundamentals (both cyclical and counter-cyclical sectors) which in turn impact the gold price,” State Street said in a recent note. Why It's Important For Gold As has been widely noted, falling interest in the U.S. and in other developed markets have been among the primary catalysts driving gold and the related ETFs higher this year. That's good news because while past rate cuts are baked into the gold price today, more rate reductions could be in store in 2020. “Lower global growth expectations, a prolonged trade dispute between the US and China, and an inversion of the yield curve have shifted the positive interest rate trajectory 180 degrees,” State Street said. “Since the start of this year, real interest rates have collapsed (dipping below zero in Q3 2019), with the Fed and ECB changing course back to accommodative monetary policies.” In other words, lower rates around the world are definitely one reason why GLD has hauled in $5.5 billion in new assets this year. See Also: A New Way To Invest In Autonomous Vehicles What's Next For Gold If global central banks insist on lowering rates with some doing so into negative territory, the answer to what's next for gold could come easily. “Against this interest rate backdrop, defensive positioning by investors is on the rise, which is supporting gold’s upward price movement in several ways,” State Street said. “As global uncertainty has risen, investors have responded according to conventional wisdom, turning to fixed income markets for both safety and stability. But with continued low rates, the traditional playbook may not best serve investor objectives going forward. From this perspective, gold’s rally may continue to find support from the attractive relative valuations and improvement in opportunity cost associated with gold.”"
2019-12-16,"PreMarket Prep Recap: Market At All-Time-Highs, But Not All News Is Good News","Although the indexes were firmly in the green during Monday's PreMarket Prep show, the co-hosts were discussing two issues that were deep in the red at the top of the broadcast. Headline Risk Is The Reality When Owning Or Shorting Boeing Ever since two fatal crashes led to the grounding of Boeing Co's (NYSE:BA) 737 Max, the term headline risk has been brought up every time the issue has been discussed on PreMarket Prep. Whether the news about Boeing is positive or negative, the stock is subject to unpredictable moves. Whether you're long or short, there will be news events that you have no control of that will have a major impact on the share price. Reports of Boeing halting or suspending production of the grounded 737 Max were hitting the issue in premarket trading Monday, and the company later confirmed the reports, stating that manufacturing would be suspended beginning in January. From a technical perspective, the issue has been in a wide trading range for the most part since May, from $319.85 to $382.85. The issue tested the upper end of the range in late November and faded and is set to attempt to test of the lower end of the range. The co-hosts alerted traders to Boeing's premarket low as a possible support area. After a lower open, Boeing momentarily breached that level, reaching $326.43 before rebounding back into the $330 handle. PG&E: Even Riskier The company most affected by destructive California wildfires is PG&E Corp (NYSE:PCG). The initial plunge in the issue took place in November 2018, when it swooned from its October month-ending close ($46.38) to end November at $26.38. The move lower continued into January of this year until it finally bottomed at $5.07 and rebounded to the $25.19 in June. From that high, PG&E made a new low for the move at $3.55 in October only to rebound again, but that rally ended last week at $13.09. The catalyst for the rebound was the announcement that the company had reached a $13.5-billion agreement to resolve individual claims relating to the 2015 Butte Fire and wildfires in 2017 and 2018. Before the open, California Gov. Gavin Newsom rejected the company's proposed restructuring plan. As a result, shares of the issue were under pressure in premarket trading. Once again, the premarket low ($7.87) was identified as a possible support level. PG&E found support off the lower open just under its Dec. 4 low ($8.80), reaching $8.64 before rebounding back into the $9 handle. Since theoretically the company is bankrupt and will violently move off headlines regarding the case, neither PreMarket Prep co-host said they're considering playing the issue from the long side. Being short the issue is no safe bet either, as seen with the rally last week that came off the news off a possible settlement on damages. Chahine Joins Tuesday's Show Midway through Monday's broadcast, Frank Holmes, CEO and CFO of U.S. Global Investors, joined as a guest. Holmes commented on the ETF S SOLUTIONS/U S GLB JETS ETF (NYSE:JETS), which covers the airline industry and related companies., and gave his outlook on gold and gold miners. Another ETF, ETF S SOLUTIONS/U S GLB GO GOLD (NYSE:GOAU), covers the gold sector. Nic Chahine, the author of Create Income With Option Spreads, will join PreMarket Prep at 8:35 a.m. Tuesday to comment on the recent rally and individual issues on his radar.

2019-12-20,The Famous SPY ETF Is Getting A Low-Cost Stablemate,"Home to nearly $300 billion in assets under management as of Dec. 19, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) remains the world's largest and most heavily traded exchange traded fund. SPY, which debuted in January 1993, is also the oldest U.S.-listed ETF and with an expense ratio of just 0.0945% per year, or $9.45 on a $10,000 investment, the fund fits the bill as inexpensive. However, SPY has faced increased competition in recent years from rival S&P 500 ETFs, namely the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO). VOO and IVV were two of the fastest-growing ETFs of the soon to be completed and lower fees explain why. VOO, the Vanguard offering, charges just 0.03% per year year while IVV has an annual fee of 0.04%. Why It's Important State Street is finally fighting back, but it's not introducing a new ETF. Rather, the third-largest U.S. ETF sponsor is converting the $3.31 billion SPDR Portfolio Large Cap ETF (NYSE:SPLG) to an S&P 500 ETF. According to a statement of addition information (SAI) issued earlier this week, SPLG, which currently tracks the SSGA Large Cap Index, will begin tracking the S&P 500 on Jan. 24. SPLG's current expense ratio of 0.03% will be maintained, putting it into a tie with VOO for the honor of least expensive S&P 500 ETF. State Street has previously used a similar strategy with some success. For example, rather than lower the fee of the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), a favorite of active traders and professional investors, the firm introduced a lower cost counterpart. The SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM) debuted in June 2018 and now has nearly $1.1 billion in assets under management. GLDM charges 0.18% per year, or 22 basis points less than GLD. What's Next There's more. State Street's SAI reveals the SPDR Portfolio Total Stock Market ETF (NYSE:SPTM) will move to the S&P Composite 1500 Index next month. With SPTM's current expense ratio of 0.03%, it will be tied with the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF (NYSE:ITOT) for least expensive ETF tracking that benchmark. The SPDR Portfolio Small Cap ETF (NYSE:SPSM) is moving to the popular S&P SmallCap 600 Index. With SPSM's annual fee of 0.05%, the fund undercuts the iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (NYSE:IJR) and the Vanguard S&P Small-Cap 600 ETF (NYSE:VIOO), both of which track the same index.

2020-01-08,"Benzinga Pro's Top 5 Stocks To Watch For Wed., Jan. 8, 2020: GDX, BA, CVS, LK, PIXY","Benzinga Pro's Stocks To Watch For Wednesday VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) - This ETF, which tracks the price action of gold mining-related assets, saw extreme volatility over Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning's sessions following retaliation by Iranian forces on 2 US bases in Iraq. Spot gold spiked to a high of $1,613.30/oz Tuesday evening but sold off sharply Wednesday. In Wednesday's pre-market session, gold last traded at $1,574.20/oz. Boeing (BA) - Shares were down 1% following news Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crashed near Tehran. The Boeing-manufactured plane, a 737-800, is considered the predecessor to the highly-controversial 737 MAX plane. CVS Health (CVS) - The stock was down about 1.5% in sympathy following worse-than-expected Q1 results out of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). Walgreens shares were down nearly 6% following the quarterly report. The other peer in the drug store space, Rite Aid (RAD)​, was down 0.2% ahead of the open. Luckin Coffee (LK) - The company announced a 12 million ADS offering Tuesday evening. Shares traded down about 3.5% Wednesday morning. ShiftPixy (PIXY) - Shares were up more than 200% following news the company completed a recapitalization and said it closed a contract assignment worth $20 million. Probably one of the most important things for traders considering action in this stock Wednesday: ShiftPixy is a known low-float play, with just ~300K shares in its float. Low-float plays should be considered one of the most volatility ideas in a given day."
2020-01-08,Gold's Santa Claus Rally Followed By Surge On Iranian Tension,"Gold prices have continued to surge this week as tensions between the U.S. and Iran drive investors toward safe harbors. Gold prices increased $50 in the opening trading days of 2020 and then reached their highest levels since 2013 in the wake of Iranian missile attacks on military bases in Iraq. The commodity was trading at $1,554.62 per ounce at the time of publication. Bethel Loh, a macro strategist at ThinkMarkets, said in a note that it's a classic demonstration of risk-off, as markets took to gold with no hesitation, pushing the shiny metal well past third-quarter 2019 highs of $1,557. Benchmark crude oil prices also rose following the U.S. airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Iranian Quds force. “The gain of 1.52% sees the risk-off hedge ink new highs not seen since 2013. Fears that Iran will disrupt major oil infrastructure, not dissimilar to when drones attacked Saudi Arabia, also saw Crude futures gap at the open and sustain above key psychological level of US$70/bbl,” Loh said. A Santa Rally In Gold Gold initially traded higher throughout the Christmas holiday in a move known as a Santa Rally due to increased demand combined with thin liquidity in FX at the year's end, said Olivier Konzeoue, an FX sales trader at Saxo Markets. “The escalation of tensions in the Middle East has since sent gold to a seven year high, as markets seek refuge in a traditional safe haven in times of uncertainty. We expect gold to redeem some of its recent gains at the first signs of de-escalation.” The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was trading down 1.08% and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was trading down 4.37% at the time of publication.

2020-01-14,The Repo Market Is So Broken That The Fed Wants To Change It,"Illiquidity in the U.S. repo market spooked investors in the second half of 2019, and the U.S. Federal Reserve is considering a major policy change that could help remedy the situation. However, the potential changes could come with some major political fallout. What Is The Repo Market? The term “repo” is short for repurchase agreement. Repo loans are overnight loans taken out by small banks and hedge funds that are repaid the following day. These banks and hedge funds use low-risk securities, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, as collateral for the loans. Liquidity in the U.S. repo market dropped back in September, and the Fed was forced to step in for the first time since the financial crisis in 2008. The Potential Fix The Fed is reportedly considering completely overhauling the current repo market and instead begin allowing the repo market clearinghouse, the Fixed Income Clearing Corp. (FICC), to lend directly to small banks and hedge funds. This change would essentially eliminate the larger bank middlemen from the process and provide a direct source of overnight loans for small banks. In theory, this change would reduce uncertainty and risk and reduce the chances a freeze in the repo market could disrupt the financial system. However, providing wealthy hedge fund managers with a direct path to Fed lending via the FICC might not sit will with the average American. The prospect of a taxpayer-funded hedge fund bailout would likely trigger political backlash. Problems Ahead? While proponents of the potential changes argue it would add liquidity and transparency to the repo market, opponents are concerned the changes would be seen as the Fed giving the green light to hedge funds to increase their leverage and make risky bets. Earlier this month, the New York Fed injected another $56.7 billion into the repo market in an effort to keep fed funds interest rates in-line with the Fed’s target range of between 1.5% and 1.75%. The Fed also said its balance sheet grew from $3.8 trillion in September to $4.17 trillion by the end of 2019. “The big picture answer is that the repo market is broken,” James Bianco, founder of Bianco Research in Chicago, told MarketWatch back in December. “They are essentially medicating the market into submission...But this is not a long-term solution.” Benzinga’s Take Perhaps uneasiness about the Fed’s role in the repo market is one of the driving forces behind a recent rally in gold and bitcoin prices, investments many traders see as stores of value and inflation hedges. In the past month alone, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 4.5%, while the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) is up 13.8% overall. Do you agree or disagree with these predictions?

2020-02-14,7 Ways To Invest In Gold Amid Coronavirus Fears,"The COVID-19 virus outbreak has certainly made investors uneasy, and the idea of a deadly global pandemic is cause for concern. One traditional safety trade for investors is to buy gold or gold mining stocks. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 3.8% so far in 2020, but the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is down 2.7%. If the new coronavirus spreading in China ultimately triggers a global economic downturn, gold prices may spike, sending gold miner margins and profits soaring. Some gold miners are better investments than others. Here are seven gold miner stocks to buy, sell and hold, according to Bank of America. Buy: Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) Analyst Michael Jalonen recently said Newmont is making good on its capital return pledge after the company raised its dividend by 79% starting in April. Newmont also plans to boost its share buybacks by up to $1 billion. The company is also refreshing its brand, changing its name from Newmont Goldcorp to Newmont Corporation. Jalonen said Newmont’s impressive project pipeline, robust free cash flow and solid balance sheet make it his top North American senior gold producer stock pick for 2020. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $52 price target for NEM stock. Buy: Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) Freeport-McMoRan is the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer and the eighth-largest gold producer. Analyst Timna Tanners recently said Freeport’s 2020 cost guidance was disappointingly high, but risks associated with the company’s shift from open pit mining to block cave mining now appear to have subsided. Tanners expects profits will normalize by 2021 once all the costs associated with the transition have passed. Ultimately, she said the transition will lead to higher production, lower costs and more byproduct credits from gold. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $14 price target for FCX stock. Buy: Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM) Agnico Eagle is a mid-tier Canadian gold mining company that operates multiple mines in Canada, Finland and Mexico. Jalonen recently said Agnico has entered a period of cash harvesting following several years of aggressive investment. Management said that cash will be used for internal investment, paying off debt and raising the stock’s dividend. Now that construction at Amaruq and Meliadine is complete, Jalonen said Agnico is well-positioned for significant free cash flow growth. Agnico is guiding for 2020 gold production growth of 10%. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $74 price target for AEM stock. Sell: AngloGold Ashanti Limited (NYSE:AU) AngloGold has 14 gold mining operations in 10 countries. Analyst Patrick Mann recently said AngloGold management is making all the right moves in focusing on returns, but the stock is overvalued following its 44.6% gain in the past year. An unpredictable global regulatory environment creates cash flow uncertainty, particularly regarding AngloGold’s operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania, the analyst said. A sale of the company’s South African operation at fair value would be a bullish catalyst for the stock, he said. Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $18.40 price target for AU stock. Hold: Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) Kinross is one of the world’s largest gold producers, with operations in the U.S., Brazil, Russia and West Africa. Kinross is guiding for 2.4 million gold equivalent ounces of production in 2020. Net debt dropped from $1.47 billion in the third quarter to $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter. Kinross generated about $100 million in cash from asset sales last quarter and Jalonen is projecting $427 million in free cash flow in 2020. Bank of America has a Hold rating and $5.85 price target for KGC stock. Buy: Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) Barrick just reported an impressive fourth-quarter earnings beat and raised its dividend by 40%. Jalonen said Barrick’s gold production outlook for 2020 is in-line with his expectations and at the high end of the company’s previous guidance, and its copper division is on solid ground as well. Barrick ended 2019 with 71 million ounces of gold reserves, up 14.5% from a year ago. The company used its $429 million in free cash flow to fund its dividend hike and pay down debt in the fourth quarter, the analyst said. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $22 price target for GOLD stock. Buy: B2Gold Corp. (NYSE:BTG) B2Gold is a global gold producer with operations focused in the Philippines, Namibia and Mali. It also has 50% ownership of the Colombian Gramalote gold project. In January, analyst Lawson Winder added the Gramalote project to his valuation, and estimated its value at about $250 million, or 24 cents per B2Gold share. Gramalote should begin production in late 2023 and boost 2024 production by about 25%, the analyst said. B2Gold has a strong cash position to fund growth and return capital to shareholders, he said. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $4.75 price target for BTG stock. Related Links: 7 Cannabis Stocks To Buy, Sell And Hold 7 Stocks To Buy Under $5"

2020-02-26,3 'Safe' ETFs If A Stock Market Correction Comes Calling,"Stocks are enduring a predictable, though unappealing reaction to the COVID-19 outbreak. So what asset classes have investors been matriculating to? Looking at the list of exchange traded funds that hit all-time highs on Tuesday, the group is heavily populated by fixed income funds. Add to that, gold prices have been soaring on the flight to safety trade. Over the past week, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed ETF, is higher by 1.6%. With that in mind, here are some ETFs that fit the bill as safe. VanEck Vectors Municipal Allocation ETF (MAAX) Municipal bonds are usually considered boring...really boring. But boring has recently been beautiful. Just look at the VanEck Vectors Municipal Allocation ETF (CBOE: MAAX), which is residing near all-time highs and is up 3.36% year-to-date while the S&P 500 is off 7.15% over the past week. MAAX, which has a 30-day SEC yield of nearly 3%, features four other VanEck municipal bond ETFs as its holdings, giving investors exposure to massive number of muni bonds across varying credit qualities and duration exposures. MAAX “remains overweight both credit and duration relative to its benchmark. This positioning allows MAAX to generate a significantly higher yield than that of its benchmark with the goal of de-risking the portfolio during periods of extreme risk,” according to VanEck. See Also: Dow Plummets 2K Points In 2 Days: Here's What The Pros Think GraniteShares Gold Trust (BAR) As noted above, gold is a popular, predictable safe-haven destination and that has been the case during the coronavirus outbreak. For the week ending Feb. 24, investors added $508.22 million to the aforementioned GLD, a total exceeded by just seven other ETFs. Long-term investors would do well to not sleep on the GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR). With its annual fee of 0.17%, BAR is one of the least expensive gold ETFs in the world and offers the same upside qualities as legacy funds in this category. This month, investors have almost $16 million to the cost-effective BAR, pumping its assets under management tally to almost $691 million. Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) The Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (NYSE:SPLV) and other low volatility ETFs offer safety in relative terms, meaning they should perform less poorly when markets swoon. Credit SPLV, one of the largest ETFs in this category, for doing its job as it has outperformed the S&P 500 by about 210 basis points over the past week. “By design, Low Vol aims at protection and participation,” S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a recent note. “A well-designed low volatility index should go down less when the market is down but also go up less when the market is up. Strong markets are the worst environments for low volatility indices, which generally underperform by the largest margin then.”"

2020-03-11,Bitcoin Is Still Failing As A Flight To Safety Investment,"Yet again, bitcoin bulls arguing that the popular cryptocurrency is a flight to safety investment during times of stock market weakness have gotten some discouraging feedback during the coronavirus-driven market sell-off. The S&P 500 has experienced one of its sharpest drops in history in the past month, but bitcoin has performed even worse during that time. There are plenty of reasons for investors to be seeking a safe haven for their cash these days given stocks are tanking and bond yields are at record lows. Unfortunately for bitcoin investors, it seems the market doesn’t see bitcoin as a viable way to preserve value. In the past month, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is down 17%. In that same stretch, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) is down 23.9% and the price of bitcoin is down 20.9%. By comparison, the traditional flight to safety trade, gold, is performing well during the stock market sell-off. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 5.8% in the past month, including another 1% rally on Wednesday morning. See Also: How To Play The 2020 Stock Market Crash: Like 1987, 2000 Or 2008? Correlations Here’s a look at the Portfolio Visualizer daily return correlation matrix for the SPY, the GBTC, the GLD ETF, the United States Oil Fund LP (ETF) (NYSE:USO), the iShares Barclays 20+ Yr Treas.Bond (ETF) (NYSE:TLT) and the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures TM ETN (NYSE:VXX). The correlations are calculated based on daily returns since January of 2018. The good news is that the numbers suggest that the GBTC bitcoin fund does have a relatively low 0.12 correlation with the SPY ETF. In fact, the GBTC ETF has even less of a correlation to stocks than the GLD ETF, which has a negative 0.18 correlation. The negative correlation likely comes in part by the fact that investors tend to buy gold on days of market weakness. Those arguing for bitcoin being its own asset class would point to the fact that the GBTC has very low correlation to stocks, gold, oil, treasury bonds or even market volatility, according to the table. Unfortunately, the correlation between bitcoin and the SPY is positive, whereas the correlation between gold and the SPY is negative. In other words, bitcoin prices tend to drop when stock prices drop and gold prices tend to rise when stock prices drop. See Also: Boredom Is The Enemy? A Look At Bitcoin Since Peaking At $20,000 Benzinga’s Take The point of a flight to safety trade is to find a stable place to park cash when stocks are falling.

2020-03-19,Gold ETFs Betray Safe-Haven Reputation In March Market Meltdown,"At a time when investors are desperate for safe-haven assets, gold and the related exchange traded funds aren't providing the expected shelter from the storm. This month, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), which had been on a torrid pace entering March, is lower by 5.7%. Gold miners ETFs have been much, much worse. On Wednesday alone, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) plunged nearly 23%, bringing its month-to-date loss to 32.67%. That after gold notched its biggest one-day rally since 2016 on Tuesday. From a technical standpoint, it appears bears control the gold future market right now. “Technically, April gold futures bears have the firm overall near-term technical advantage,” reports Kitco News. “Gold bulls' next upside near-term price breakout objective is to produce a close above solid technical resistance at $1,600.00. Bears' next near-term downside price breakout objective is pushing prices below solid technical support at this week’s low of $1,450.90.” See Also: Trump Signs Coronavirus Relief Bill, ECB Injects $821B In Liquidity, Japan Considers Cash Payouts Bearish Betrayal...Or Not Proving that leveraged ETFs, particularly those involving gold miners, must be treated as short-term instruments, all four of the bellwether geared funds focusing on this segment are in red this month. Yes, even in the inverse products. Take the case of Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:DUST). DUST attempts to deliver triple the daily inverse returns of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. Even amid a rough stretch for gold and the miners, DUST was scuffling this month. Until Wednesday when DUST surged 31.79% on more than double the average daily volume. A similar situation is scene with DUST's small-cap counterpart – the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:JDST) – is lower by more than 60% over the past week and that's with the benefit of a Wednesday gain of almost 22%. The Bull Case Timing reentry into the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:NUGT), the bullish equivalent of the aforementioned DUST, is historically tricky and that task is even more so following NUGT's Wednesday slide of 49.34%, but some market observers believe there are still tailwinds for the miners. “The fiscal and monetary measures currently being taken rival those seen during the housing crisis of 2008/2009, a time when owning gold and miners was extremely lucrative,”according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. “Higher government spending and stimulus generally equates to higher prices in metals, and conversely a lower U.S. Dollar. Should this trend continue, further quantitative easing and government stimulus should push prices in these sectors even higher.” Assuming those good vibes for miners materialize, ambitious traders could look to the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:JNUG), which is coming off a Wednesday loss of almost 61%, which pushed its March decline to over 90%."
2020-03-19,"Gold Analyst Says Prices Will Stabilize At $1,600 Once Market Panic Subsides","Gold’s safe haven status has been challenged further this week as gold prices continue to decline. The commodity was down to $1,498 on Thursday as world stock markets continued to slump due to the coronavirus pandemic. More risk-averse investors have been displaying a marked preference for the dollar at the expense of bullion, according to FXTM analysts. “Gold has been left in the dollar’s wake, as investors rush to lap up the greenback amid a liquidity crunch and fears that the global economy is hurtling towards a recession, said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM. With volatility in gold prices at its highest since 2008, bullion has not been spared by the market panic. Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter. Once the liquidity squeeze eases and gold prices find more stable footing, investors concerned about the global economic outlook should eventually come back to the precious metal and send prices towards $1,600, according to FXTM. For the immediate term, should bullion prices weaken further, stronger support is set to arrive at the $1,400 psychological level, Tan said. Once gold is allowed to rediscover its equilibrium, that should serve as a platform for bullion to make its way toward $1,600, the analyst said. Price Action The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was trading down 0.53% at $139.95 at the time of publication Thursday and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was trading up 7.27% at $21.11.

2020-03-24,7 ETFs To Buy In A Recession,"When the economy transitions from expansion to contraction and the market transitions from a bull to a bear, investors can’t expect all the same stocks and funds to outperform and the same investing strategies to continue to work. Economic fears due to the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus has led the market to plummet in the past month, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling from the 30,000 level to under 19,000 earlier this week. Investors priorities flip from maximizing gains to minimizing risk, and buying volume rotates into brand new pockets of the market. The past few weeks of trading in the market may seem like total chaos, but a closer look reveals certain groups of stocks and funds are outperforming others. Here are eight ETFs to consider that could outperform during a U.S. recession. Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter. 1. Health Care SPDR (NYSE:XLV) The health care sector is one of the main sectors of the economy that has historically been a defensive place for investors to put their money during economic downturns. While other businesses are shutting down amid the COVID-19 outbreak, demand for health care services is booming. In the longer term, the fact that former Vice President Joe Biden has surpassed Senator Bernie Sanders as the likely Democratic presidential candidate further eliminates risks associated with a radical overhaul of the U.S. health care and pharmaceutical industries. In the past month, the XLV ETF is down just 21.6% compared to a 29.5% drop by the overall S&P 500. 2. Utilities SPDR (NYSE:XLU) Another potential place for investors to find safety during a recession is Utility stocks. In addition to its relative stability and downside valuation protection, the XLU ETF pays a generous 4.6% dividend yield. Utilities have historically outperformed during economic downturns because Americans must keep the lights on and water flowing no matter how bad it gets. Many utilities have limited competition and operate under strict government regulations, which further serve to create a stable earnings and revenue environment. Utilities may not be a sexy investment, but they can be an excellent source of reliable dividend income while interest rates are at 0%. 3. Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR (NYSE:XLP) Another market sector that performs relatively well when the economy tanks is the consumer staples sector. When Americans cut their spending in times of uncertainty, those cuts don’t typically include toothpaste, toilet paper and laundry detergent. Consumer staples stocks are relatively recession-resistant, making them safe places to invest during market downturns. Over the past month, the XLP ETF is down just 19.4%, making it the best-performing SPDR sector ETF of all. As an added bonus, the XLP ETF pays a 3.1% dividend, so investors can get paid while they wait for the economy to recover. 4. SPDR S&P Dividend (NYSE:SDY) Not only do dividend stocks and ETFs provide yield for investors when interest rates are nearly 0%, many dividend stocks actually outperform the broad market during economic downturns. The SDY ETF pays a 3.3% yield, which is leaps and bounds better than the interest rates you’ll find these days in U.S. Treasuries, high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit. The risk in buying high-yield dividend stocks is that the economic hardship will trigger a dividend cut. But dividend ETFs such as the SDY, which holds 120 different stocks, provide the type of diversification that protects against individual dividend cuts. 5. VANGUARD IX FUN/RL EST IX FD ETF (NYSE:VNQ) Real estate is another popular flight-to-safety investment, and real estate investment trusts often pay extremely high yields. The VNQ ETF holds 181 different investments that cover roughly two-thirds of the entire U.S. REIT market. Real estate has historically had relatively low correlation to traditional stocks and bonds, making the VNQ fund an excellent source of portfolio diversification. Investors also don’t have to worry about REIT dividend cuts as they are obligated by law to distribute 90% of income to investors. The VNQ ETF currently pays a 5.5% yield and has an expense ratio of just 0.12%. See Also: Ray Dalio: What's Happening In The Markets Has Not Happened In Our Lifetime 6. SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) The classic safe-haven investment during times of economic turmoil is gold. There are plenty of reasons investors buy gold during recessions. They argue that there is a limited quantity of physical gold in the world, although gold miners add roughly 3,300 tons of gold to the global supply annually. Gold buyers also see the precious metal as a hedge against inflation that could be triggered by central bank stimulus over time. Whatever the reason, the GLD ETF is down just 2.4% year-to-date, insulating investors from the majority of the broad market sell-off. 7. ISHARES TR/EDGE MSCI INTL VALU (NYSE:IVLU) Another way for investors to protect themselves during a recession is to rotate from growth stocks to value stocks. Value stocks typically have high profit levels relative to their share prices and tend to generate strong cash flows, have stable revenues and carry relatively low debt levels. Self-funding, blue-chip companies can be insulated from the type of uncertainty that is created if credit markets start to tighten. Many of these stocks also pay dividends. The IVLU is one good way for U.S. investors to get exposure to international value stocks and a 2.5% yield."
2020-03-26,PreMarket Prep Stock Of The Day: SPDR Gold Trust,"Benzinga's PreMarket Prep airs every morning from 8-9 a.m. ET. During that fast-paced, highly informative hour, traders and investors tune in to get the major news of the day, the catalysts behind those moves and the corresponding price action for the upcoming session. On any given day, the show will cover at least 20 stocks determined by co-hosts Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick along with producer Spencer Israel. For those who don't have the time to tune in live or listen to the podcast, Benzinga will highlight one stock that merits further discussion. This analysis is not a buy or sell recommendation. Not only have stocks been volatile as of late, but so have the futures markets. One of the most popular futures markets is gold. For those not wanting to venture into the futures markets, a similar ETF that mimics the moves in gold is the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). A Gold ETF As described by ETF.com, the GLD is the largest ETF to invest directly in physical gold. Its structure as a grantor trust protects investors: trustees cannot lend the gold bars. Yet taxes on long-term gains can be steep, as GLD is deemed a collectible by the IRS. It is extremely liquid, trading at miniscule spreads. Different Trading Hours Than Futures One disadvantage to trading the ETF instead of the futures market: limited trading hours. While the futures market trades nearly on a 24-hour basis, GLD does not. After-hours trading takes place from 4-8 p.m. EST and premarket trading is from 4-9:30 a.m. EST. Movement in the spot gold and futures market will not be reflected in the share price during those time periods. During those times, there are often huge price fluctuations that can work for or against your position. Gold, Gold Stocks Not Always A Safe Haven The primary reason investors put some of their portfolio in gold is that it is perceived as a safe haven or a hedge against declines in the stock market. On many occasions, this turns out to be true. In the recent market downturn, almost everything was crushed — including the metals markets. The reason is that the meltdown in the global equities markets triggered forced liquidation in all markets, including the commodities and a surge in the U.S. dollar. Technical Take On The Gold Futures At the onset of the massive decline in the equites, gold futures acted a safe haven, As the market began to crater in later February, the April gold futures made a seven-year high on March 9 ($1,704.30) and ended that session at $1,675.70 before the bottom fell out. Over the next five days, it made a new low for the year by $75, falling to $1,450.90 on March 17 and rebounding to the end the session at $1,486.50. As quickly as it fell, gold bounced back over the next six sessions, peaking on Wednesday at $1,699.30 before backing off to end the day at $1,633.50. At this time, you have to respect the major resistance at the psychological $1,700 area. For those investors looking for another leg higher, that is the major hurdle gold has to clear. If not, a breach the matching lows from Wednesday ($1,615.20) and as of Noon EST Thursday ($1,611) could indicate a another retreat. Gold was trading at $1,637 per ounce at the time of publication Thursday, according to goldprice.org. The SPDR Gold Trust was 1.84% higher at $154.08."

Adami is optimistic as Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) bounced off $41-$42 level, while VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and VANECK VECTORS/JR GOLD MINERS ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) moved sharply higher.

2020-04-08,"Jim Iuorio Weighs In On Market, Gold And Oil","On CNBC's The Exchange, Jim Iuorio shared with the viewers his opinion on the S&P 500, gold and crude oil. He sees a price range in the S&P 500 from 2,620 to 2,640 as very important because it corresponds to four highs from the last week of March and also to lows from Wednesday and Tuesday. He thinks the market looks good while it's trading above the range. Iuorio believes gold is going to do pretty well in this environment as the stimulus offers nice fundamental story for the precious metal. He has a long position and he wants to see it above $1,700. It has to trade comfortably above this level. OPEC and Russia can support oil price, but we should take baby steps here, said Iuorio. He thinks the demand destruction is huge and the economy has to come back for crude oil to move higher. Traders who want to trade S&P 500, gold and crude oil, but don't want to use futures, can take a look at SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and United States Oil Fund LP (NYSE:USO)."
2020-04-14,Analysts Share Their Views On Gold,"On CNBC's Trading Nation, Steve Chiavarone of Federated Hermes said gold is difficult to analyze because it has no cash flows, so you're just trying to understand what the demand is going to be and that is a bit of a gamble. He finds gold's rally logical because the economic growth fell of a cliff and there was an unprecedented stimulus by central banks. Uncertainty is also high. Over the long run, Chiavarone sees stocks as a better bet than gold as we're looking toward the eventual recovery for the economy. See Also: 8 Best Investment Strategies During A Recession Bill Baruch of Blue Line Capital said he loves gold and investors need some gold in their portfolios. He noticed on its chart a bullish technical pattern called inverse head and shoulders that played out through March into April. He doesn't like to chase gold when everybody else is screaming for it. You want to be capitalizing on gold that you own during those times, said Baruch. However, he said the precious metal is going to trade to $2,000 over the rest of this year because of the massive liquidity injected by the Fed. The stimulus is going to support asset prices like equities, but it's also going to support gold. Baruch would look for a pullback to $1,700 as a buying opportunity. Investors who want exposure to gold, but don't want to trade futures, should take a look at SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD)."
2020-04-16,This Investor Is Most Comfortable In Precious Metals,"On CNBC's Trading Nation, Peter Boockvar of Bleakley Advisory Group said that in this world of negative interest rates, zero interest rates and seemingly unlimited money printing by major central banks, he is most comfortable in a position of gold and silver. After we re-open, he foresees higher inflation as the demand offsets the ability of the economy to supply goods and services. In such an environment, he sees crude oil and agriculture as attractive investments."
2020-04-22,"Gold Analyst Says Rally Is Short-Term, Prices Will Recede To $1,600 By Year's End","Gold has rallied over the past month, but it's a short-term rally, according to one analyst. If the global economy finds its feet over the second half of 2020, safe haven purchases of gold are likely to ease substantially, with the commodity's price falling back to $1,600 by the end of 2020. On Wednesday, the shares of several gold and silver companies were trading higher as equities gained amid a potential stabilization in oil prices. Capital Economics analyst Oliver Allen said that while gold has rallied over the past month, he doesn’t think that it will continue to outperform most other asset classes. The GSCI Precious Metals Index, in which the weight of gold is 90%, will be the worst-performing headline index among those tracked by the Capital Economics asset allocation service, he said. The index has returned almost 15% over the past month, Allen said. Of the headline indices that we cover on our Asset Allocation Service, only a handful have fared better over the same period. This has mainly reflected a surge in the price of gold, from just under $1,500/oz. to roughly $1,700. What Triggered The Recent Gold Rally? Gold’s rally has resulted primarily from two developments, the analyst said. The first is an unwinding of the fire sales that took a toll on safe, as well as risky, assets during the first half of March, as the turmoil in markets that followed the spread of the coronavirus around the world reached its peaked. The subsequent fall back in the bid-ask spread for gold suggests that this pressure has now eased considerably. The second trigger is massive policy support from the Fed, which pushed down nominal Treasury yields and led to a recovery in investors’ expectations for inflation, Allen said. “As a result, the real yields of those bonds fell by even more than nominal yields and so reduced the opportunity cost of owning gold, which is a 'real' asset that pays no income. Real yields tend to have a close relationship with the price of gold.” Allen predicts that the price of gold will fall back to $1,600 by the end of 2020. Price Action Gold prices were at $1,711.28 at the time of publication Wednesday. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was trading up 1.61 % at $161.16 at the time of publication Wednesday and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was trading up 4.91% at $32.06.

2020-04-26,"7 Best-Performing Stocks Of 2020: Buy, Sell Or Hold?","The S&P 500 has rallied hard off its March lows, but the index remains down 12.9% year-to-date overall. The near-term economic outlook amid the COVID-19 shutdown is still unclear, creating a lot of uncertainty on Wall Street. The International Monetary Fund recently cut its 2020 global economic growth forecast to negative 3%. Fortunately for investors, a number of stocks have bucked the bearish trend and gained ground this year. Some of those stocks will maintain that bullish momentum as the economic downturn drags on, while others will prove to be overbought and regress. Here’s what Bank of America analysts have to say about the seven best-performing S&P 500 stocks of 2020 (excluding buyouts). Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN) - Hold Regeneron is a biopharmaceutical company focused on treating eye disorders, hypercholesterolemia, cancer and other conditions. Regeneron shares have been on fire in 2020 for two main reasons. First, the company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings in February. Second, Regeneron is reportedly working with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop a treatment for COVID-19. Analyst Geoff Meacham recently said fading Eylea revenue plus an unproven early drug pipeline suggests limited near-term upside after a year-to-date gain of 45%. Bank of America has a Neutral rating and $575 price target for REGN stock. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) - Buy Gold is one of the few investments that has performed well in 2020 as investors worry about the long-term impact that the $2.3-trillion stimulus package will have on the dollar. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 12.9% year-to-date, and Newmont is up 42.6%. The company recently withdrew its 2020 guidance after COVID-19 forced shutdowns of mines in Yanacocha, Musselwhite, Eleonore and Cerro Negro. Analyst Michael Jalonen recently said he is bullish on Newmont despite the temporary closures and the stock has some of the strongest fundamentals within the gold space. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $73 price target for NEM stock. Citrix Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CTXS) - Hold Citrix is a software platform that enables access to enterprise solutions from a variety of connections and locations. Analyst Nikolay Beliov recently said Citrix’s cloud transition creates near-term uncertainty in earnings and free cash flow despite an overall solid fourth quarter. Following the stock’s 36.7% year-to-date gain, Beliov said there is limited upside for Citrix from current levels. In fact, Citrix ranked dead last among 37 companies in Bank of America’s recent screen of fundamentals within the server and enterprise software group. Bank of America has a Neutral rating and $160 price target for CTXS stock. NortonLifeLock Inc (NASDAQ:NLOK) - Sell Norton LifeLock provides online security and risk management software and services, and the stock has rallied 35% so far in 2020. Beliov says the company has aggressive long-term targets and the market is significantly overvaluing the stock. Beliov says it’s surprising to see the price action in the stock in 2020 given the company has lost 1.1 million direct subscribers over the past three years. In addition, average revenue per user has dropped substantially and growth has stagnated. Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $14 price target for NLOK stock. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) - Buy Netflix’s negative price action after its blowout first-quarter earnings report was a classic case of sell the news after its stock got a bit ahead of itself with a 30.2% year-to-date gain. Netflix reported 15.77 million global net subscriber additions in the first quarter, well ahead of consensus analyst expectations of 8.2 million. Netflix got a huge subscriber boost due to stay-at-home measures around the world. Following Netflix’s biggest subscriber beat in history, analyst Nat Schindler said COVID-19 measures have helped Netflix take a major leap forward in penetration. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $525 price target for NFLX stock. Southwestern Energy Company (NYSE:SWN) - Sell Southwestern Energy is one of the largest U.S. natural gas producers. WTI crude oil prices recently plummeted into negative territory due to concerns over national storage capacity approaching 100%. The potential for U.S. oil production to grind to a total halt in the near-term means less natural gas is being produced, which is bullish for gas prices. In fact, in the past five trading days alone, the United States Oil Fund LP (NYSE:USO) crashed 43.5%, while the United States Natural Gas Fund, LP (NYSE:UNG) gained 17.6%. Analyst Doug Leggate says he is concerned about the long-term outlook for natural gas prices and he believes Southwestern’s valuation has gotten too rich. Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $1.20 price target for SWN stock. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) - Buy Nearly all of Amazon.com’s businesses have benefited from the COVID-19 lockdown, including its e-commerce sales, its cloud services business and its streaming video platforms. In fact, Amazon has already announced it is hiring 175,000 new employees in 2020 to help support its business, especially its Whole Foods delivery services. Bank of America analyst Justin Post recently said Amazon’s heavy logistics investments in recent years have set the segment up to be a significant contributor to future revenue growth. Post says Amazon’s scale, market share and margins are unrivaled in the high-growth e-commerce space. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $2,480 price target for AMZN stock.

2020-04-30,"Fast Money' Traders Answer Questions On Uber, Chipotle And More","On CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report, Margaret Reid said she would hold Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) for the long term. Joe Terranova said Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) is trading so high because digital orders are up, the loyalty program continues to swell and the company didn't take any government loans. He added that it has no debt and it has $1 billion in cash. Josh Brown bought Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) at much lower price and he is not a seller. This has been a huge recovery for a company that is right in the middle of some of the worst effects of COVID-19 on the economy. He would wait for a better opportunity to buy the stock. Stephen Weiss is out of his Cloudera Inc (NYSE:CLDR) position for a while. If he didn't own so many stocks in the space, he would take a look, but at the moment he is not the best source. He advised a viewer to do some work on the stock because its fundamentals look strong. Jon Najarian likes Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) because a lot of people signed up for the delivery. He would buy SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) rather than individual stocks. He sees gold trading dramatically higher because of the Fed actions. Reid said Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) has been on its dividend strategy list for some time. She finds its dividend resilient and the stock trades on attractive valuation to its peers. She likes the cloud deal with Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM). Terranova likes CME Group Inc (NASDAQ:CME), but he prefers MarketAxess Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:MKTX) and Nasdaq Inc (NASDAQ:NDAQ). MarketAxess is the best exchange trade, said Terranova."
2020-04-30,"Mining Sector Hit By Coronavirus Lockdowns, Silver Production Walloped","The mining sector is seeing severe disruption, with activity being suspended across a number of countries due to the coronavirus pandemic and silver production affected. Thirty-two countries have issued partial or complete lockdown orders, leading to the temporary suspension of activities at over 1,600 mines as of April 3, according to GlobalData. Some exempted mines are also operating with reduced numbers of workers to minimize the potential spread of the virus, which is causing a slow return for the industry. Mining Regions Impacted Lockdowns remain in force in countries such as Peru until May 10, Mexico until May 30, Bolivia until April 30 and Namibia until May 4. In Quebec, the government has extended restrictions to May, but allowed mines to reopen from April 15 onward as essential services if they comply with strict measures to limit the spread of the virus. Restrictions on mining in India, Argentina, Zimbabwe and South Africa have also been withdrawn, with mining seen as an essential service. Silver Production Curtailed By Pandemic Vinneth Bajaj, mining analyst at GlobalData, explained why silver production is being severely damaged by lockdown measures. “As of 27 April, the equivalent of 65.8% of annual global silver production was on hold. Silver mining companies such as First Majestic Silver Corp. (NYSE:AG), Hochschild, Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) and Endeavour Silver Corp (NYSE:EXK) have all withdrawn their production guidance for 2020 in the wake of the outbreak,” he said. Progress has also been halted on 23 mines under construction, including the $5.3-billion Quellaveco copper mine in Peru, which is one of the world’s biggest copper mines under development, according to GlobalData. “The project has an annual copper production capacity of up to 180kt and is expected to commence operations by 2022. In Chile, while a lockdown is not in force, Antofagasta has halted work on its Los Pelambres project and Teck Resources has suspended work on the Quebrada Blanca Phase II mine,” said Bajaj. Supply Disruption Will Be Short-Lived Supply disruptions due to the pandemic are occurring, but there is the potential that these will be relatively short-lived, said Bryan Slusarchuk, CEO of Fosterville South Exploration. Mining companies will adapt safety and health protocols in an attempt to meet this challenge, and mining is an essential industry around the world, he said. “Safety and health always must remain the number one priority for mining companies, so the focus is on safe operations while mining to provide the critical materials that all of us need.” Good Environment For Gold From a precious metals perspective, the environment has never been better for gold, Slusarchuk said. “Gold has been a store of wealth, a currency and a hedge against uncertainty for thousands of years and, geopolitically, monetarily and socially, there is an extreme amount of uncertainty out there.” Price Action The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was down 1.8% at $158.80 at the close Thursday, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was down 5.2% at $32.26 Related Links: Gold Analyst Says Rally Is Short-Term, Prices Will Recede To $1,600 By Year's End Barrick Gold Reports Q2 Earnings Beat"
2020-05-05,Here's Why Gold Prices Are Rising And Silver Prices Are Falling,"This year has been a strange year in Wall Street no matter how you look at it. But at least one strange dynamic between the prices of gold and silver actually has a somewhat simple explanation. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is down 10.8% year-to-date in 2020. So far this year, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) has been a major market leader, gaining 11.6%. But at the same time, the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) has been a significant laggard, dropping 16.9% on the year. In fact, the ratio of gold-to-silver prices is currently around 116, its highest level in history dating back to ancient times, according to DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas. History Lesson For hundreds of years, the ratio of gold-to-silver prices ranged from around 15 to around 20 up to the point the U.S. came off the gold standard in the 1970s. Since that time, the ratio has spiked significantly above 40 several times. Colas said these spikes have typically occurred during periods of economic and/or geopolitical instability. While it may seem strange for gold and silver prices to be heading in opposite directions, Colas said the key to the strange dynamic lies in the demand drivers for both metals. Industrial demand accounted for about 51% of silver demand in 2019 and only 9% of gold demand. At the same time, gold demand is driven much more by investors, who see the metal as a flight-to-safety trade during times of market turmoil and periods in which investors are fearful of inflation. Given industrial demand has plummeted due to coronavirus (COVID-19) shutdowns and investor demand for gold has jumped due to concerns about the global economy, Colas said it makes perfect sense why the prices of the two metals are heading in opposite directions. “Silver prices won’t recover until the global economy and industrial production do, so the gold/silver ratio at all-time highs makes sense,” he said. Benzinga’s Take For investors who believe the worst of the COVID-19 crisis is now passed and an economic recovery is imminent, the high gold-to-silver ratio could present an interesting pair trade opportunity. Traders who anticipate the gold-to-silver ratio will ultimately regress toward its long-term average could consider buying the SLV fund and shorting the GLD fund. Do you agree with this take?

2020-05-18,"Strategist Expects Gold, Silver To Gain As Pandemic Panic Subsides","Gold and silver prices rallied Monday amid market strength as news from a Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) trial stoked optimism about a potential coronavirus vaccine. On Monday, June gold futures were trading at $1,733 and July Comex silver prices were at $17.39 per ounce. “Gold and gold stocks had a strong month, recovering all of their March losses and moving to long-term highs,” Joe Foster, portfolio manager and strategist at VanEck, said in a note. Hedging With Gold As the pandemic market panic subsides, investors are trying to gauge the risks and opportunities in a world that carries a level of uncertainty that only those with memories of the Great Depression and World War II have experienced, the VanEck strategist said. “Continued strong inflows to bullion exchange traded products along with strong demand for retail coins indicates both institutions and individuals are turning to gold as a store of value and hedge against uncertainty,” Foster said. On April 9, gold jumped $40 per ounce when the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled its $2.3-trillion program to aid local governments and small- and mid-sized businesses. “It [gold] went on to a new seven-year high of $1,747 per ounce on 14 April, then consolidated its gains around the $1,700 level. Gold ended the month at $1,686 per ounce for a $109 (6.9%) gain,” he said. Banks 'Can't Arbitrarily Print' Gold The trillions being injected into the economy via quantitative easing alongside monetary and fiscal stimuli devalues and debases paper currency, said Bryan Slusarchuk, CEO of Fosterville South Exploration. “Gold is the only currency that central banks can't arbitrarily print more of, and as such it is the only currency that acts with stability during a time of crisis,” he said. With more and more paper currency in circulation, the currencies become inherently worth less and less, the CEO said. Price Action The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was down 0.57% at $163 at the time of publication Monday, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was down 1.56% at $36.

2020-06-03,'Fast Money' Traders Weigh In On Gold,"On CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report, Meghan Shue said that short-term fundamentals suggest a mixed outlook for gold in the near term. She would look for a better entry point. Joe Terranova said he always likes to have gold in his portfolio because it offers diversification. He added that in the current environment, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) would work better than SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Pete Najarian also likes the miners and he would consider individual names that provide exposure to gold. He currently owns SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (NYSE:XME), which has a mix of metals and gold names."
2020-06-05,"Gold ETFs Shatter Previous Years Records, And Were Not Even Halfway Into 2020","Led by the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the category's big kahuna, gold exchange-traded funds are on torrid asset-gathering paces this year. What Happened Not only are assets under management at gold ETFs, in aggregate, residing at all-time highs, but year-to-date inflows to these products are beating any previous year's record not even halfway through 2020. “Continuing their growth streak, gold-backed ETFs (gold ETFs) added 154 tonnes (t) – net inflows of US$8.5bn (+4.3%) across all regions in May, boosting global holdings to a new all-time high of 3,510t,” according to the World Gold Council. “Year-to-date, inflows (623t, US$33.7bn) now exceed the highest level of annual inflows (591t) seen in 2009.” Year to date, investors have added $12.95 billion to GLD, the largest bullion-backed ETF in the world. Only two other ETFs have seen larger inflows. Why It's Important Low interest rates in the U.S., debased currencies and loose monetary in other countries, global central bank buying of gold and investors' thirst for safe-haven assets against the backdrop of the coronavirus are providing a perfect storm for gold ETFs. “Positive flows combined with a rising gold price also pushed assets under management (AUM) in gold ETFs to new record highs of US$195bn, even as stock and bond prices increased,” said the WGC. “Global gold ETFs had inflows in all but two trading days during April and May (41 of 43 days). The only other historical period with similarly consistent inflows occurred in May and June of 2016, when funds experienced inflows in all but four trading days.” Other gold ETFs attracting capital at impressive rates include the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), which added $4.43 billion in the year-to-date period. What's Next Data confirm gold ETFs are popular with investors around the world, but North America remains the driving force in this category. “North American-listed gold ETFs led regional inflows during May. Flows in the region are historically more correlated with gold’s price behaviour,” said the WGC. “The region’s funds led inflows for a second straight month, adding 102t (US$5.6bn, 5.6% AUM). North American funds now hold 1,815t of gold, surpassing the previous highs of 1,736t they held in December 2012. European funds added 45t (US$2.4bn, 2.9%), led by UK-based funds, which accounted for 65% of the total in the region. Asian funds – primarily in China – grew, adding 4.4t (US$262mn, 4.7%), and funds in other regions grew 4.3%, adding 2.6t and US$136mn.” Investors are also flocking to lower-cost gold ETFs as the SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM) and the GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR), two of the least expensive funds in the category, have added more than $1.6 billion combined. Disclosure: The author owns shares of IAU."
2020-06-12,"Gold Rally Stalls As Prices Settle Around $1,700, Analyst Expects Further Pullback","A gold rally that followed the Federal Reserve's signal of no interest rate hikes through at least 2022 was dissipating Friday. The price of gold was around $1,735 at the time of publication. Gold's Safe Haven Rally: This year’s rally in gold has come on the back of a coronavirus-led surge in safe-haven buying and a plunge in interest rate expectations, according to Capital Economics. “We suspect that the uptick in the gold price has come from investors positioning themselves against the risk of inflation, though we don’t expect it to pick up much in the short term. As such, we think the gold price will fall back by year-end,” Capital Economics commodities economist James O'Rourke said in a research note. The analyst expects gold will come under pressure from fading safe-haven demand, falling to $1,600 per ounce by year-end. “We expect U.S. interest rates to remain at their lower bound going forward, so the gold price is unlikely to benefit from a further fall in rate expectations anytime soon. And unless the virus takes a turn for the worse, we think safe-haven demand will wane too as the global economy recovers, ultimately weighing on the gold price,” O'Rourke said. Temporary Pullback In Gold? Bryan Slusarchuk, CEO of Fosterville South (FSXLF:OTC), said the underlying fundamentals for gold are extremely strong: quantitative easing infinity, a low-to-negative interest rate environment and unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimuli. “Paper currency is being devalued both intentionally and unintentionally and the result will be higher values ascribed to the only currency that can’t be printed, the CEO said. Slusarchuk said this “temporary pullback” is a combination of profit -aking and continued strength through Thursday in the U.S. market. “When the larger markets level out or correct, and the underlying factors supporting gold strength become more broadly known, gold will take the next leg up in what is a once in a generation gold bull market en route,” he said. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.49% at $163.19 at last check, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 0.43% at $32.97.

2020-06-14,'So Far And So Fast': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: “A sell-off had become inevitable because the market had come so far and so fast, and because it involved pricing for perfection,” said John Authers, a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Remember This: “Sooner or later we will get a real economic recovery and from that point the stocks that were thrown out will lead the market,” said Mike Lippert, portfolio manager at Baron Opportunity Fund. Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical Risk-off sentiment after equity indices erased an earlier gap that occurred on hopeful economic data. The island of balance left behind will offer resistance on any correction higher. If the market trades through that area, then sentiment has changed and the initiative activity that drove prices lower is no longer present. Recapping last week’s action, Monday overnight traded to a low-volume area from Friday creating a ledge at $3,211 that the market later traded through, into the close. Prices above the ledge were rejected after Tuesday's overnight auctioned below the breakout point, to the resting liquidity at $3,190. Wednesday's FOMC meeting officially ended the move higher as volatility increased and the market closed lower. Thursday displayed a rush from risk as selling was persistent and strong into the close. Friday failed to generate continued selling below $3,000, closing above the $2,975 prior balance area and anchored VWAP. Putting everything together, the picture points to the potential for a correction up to the coming Friday option expiration. If liquidation continues into the coming week and value moves lower, then the near-term bullish narrative is no longer intact. Scroll to bottom of document for non-profile charts.

2020-06-17,'Take Risk Off The Table': One Wealth Manager's Commentary On The Volatile Markets,"In February, financial markets experienced a historic liquidation that paralleled the onset of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Since late March, markets have rebounded, with the S&P 500 rising in excess of 40%. Despite the market’s impressive rally, some large investors are anticipating the resurgence of a bear trend. Bert Herzog, founder and director at Executive Wealth Management, spoke with Benzinga about how small investors can hedge their portfolios from larger drawdowns. About Herzog In 1981, Herzog set up an insurance company, that was later rebranded after growing its suite of products and services. “We were part of the fee-based movement,” said Herzog. “I got my CFP and RIA and worked many years making sure we kept our clients’ best interests in mind.” Herzog’s firm manages in excess of a billion dollars in assets via proprietary foundational research and technology. “Back in 1998, we started developing tactical software programs that would allow us to overweight underweight sectors in equity, small-cap, large-cap, mid-cap international, obviously high-yield bonds, etc.,” he said. “It keeps people in their lanes and allows them to become overweight in times when things are good, and underweight when they should be taking risk off the table.” The Disconnect “There has been somewhat of a disconnect between the market and the current economic situation. It doesn’t support the levels that it’s at right now at 40 times forward earnings.” Herzog told Benzinga that COVID-19’s impact on the economy may lead to further pullbacks in the stock market. “With the length of the shutdown, we’re going to have economic constraints in the next three to six months,” he said. “I don’t really see a turnaround until 2021.” Herzog expects that the impact on businesses and cities will be profound. As a result, the wealth manager urges investors to tread carefully, taking advantage of the rally to cut risk. “A lot of people fail to realize the S&P 500 is overweight by 15 to 20 mega-stocks,” Herzog said. “Stocks like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Walmart may be doing well, but the majority of the market is still struggling.” Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter. Rebalance And Protect “We’re not just going to be able to turn the economy on by switching a light switch. It’ll be more of a gradual buildup -- like a dimmer switch -- so, I am cautiously optimistic.” The rally is a strategic opportunity for people in pre-retirement and early retirement to rebalance and protect. “A lot of people, 55 and up, held and didn’t rebalance in 2008 and 2009, Herzog said. They’re holding the same index and small-cap funds which have become up to 80% of their net worth. They need to take risk off the table.” Herzog suggested investors allocate 45-50% of their portfolios to assets such as gold, cash and fixed income, waiting for the broader economy to recover before investing in riskier assets. “I think that long-term, this will benefit you. It will give you an opportunity to be on the sidelines for the next 6 months and determine, alongside your advisor, what your risk profile needs to be to make sure you don’t ever run out of money.” Once a broader recovery takes hold, investors can look to value and disruptive innovation; “There is no alternative to the stock market with interest rates at zero and federal stimulus,” Herzog said. “I do think long term we will be fine.” To learn more about strategic financial planning and making an impact with your investments, click here."
2020-06-21,Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead: 'A New Expansion',"Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: The U.S. stock market “is discounting a new expansion phase of the economy at the same time as a major recession has only just begun,” said Kevin Smith, Crescat Capital’s chief investment officer. Remember This: “The survey-type releases next week are going to be extremely important,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:AMTD). “It’s not just the headline itself, a lot of these survey types of releases have a component where they ask about future expectations. And that really to me is what’s driving optimism in the market, the expectation that things will improve in the future.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures. Technical: Mixed messages came equity indices broke the short-term, momentum-driven uptrend and corrected on June 11. Overall, the island of balance left behind, after the market sold off, is still intact and will offer resistance on upward auctions. If the market trades through that area, then sentiment has changed and the initiative activity that drove prices lower is no longer present. Recapping Last Week’s Action: Monday displayed a rejection of lower prices after overnight activity started off weak, on a gap down, but quickly corrected into the regular trading session, going higher through the $3,000 S&P 500 level. Tuesday’s trade blew through most of the resting offers overnight, into a low-volume area and on a record increase in U.S. retail sales. Later on, after a choppy open, the market established good excess on the lower extreme, and pinned near the $3,100 level. Wednesday and Thursday’s action was fairly muted as the market continued digesting the upward correction going into Friday’s simultaneous expiry of options and futures tied to index products. Despite gapping to the high end of the week-long balance overnight, Friday’s trade was volatile and lacked conviction to continue into the resting liquidity at and above the $3,135 area. Putting everything together, the picture points to the potential for a volatile week ahead. With the removal of S&P open interest, gamma — the sensitivity of options to changes in underlying price — imbalances and hedging activity could heighten volatility. If liquidation continues into the coming week and value moves lower, then the near-term bullish narrative is no longer intact. Scroll to the bottom of this story for non-profile charts.

2020-06-28,Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead: 'How Long Can Tech Lead?',"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “The S&P 500 is up 1.3% month-to-date (through June 25), but has struggled to push higher as it moves towards its previous peak,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist for Ally Financial, Inc-owned (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “Looking at the breadth of the market is one way to gauge the health of the overall market. Right now, only 39% of S&P 500 stocks have closed above their 200-day moving averages, even though the S&P 500 remains above its own 200-day moving average. That has us wondering how long tech can lead the market higher on its own.” Remember This: “As good as the recent economic data has been, we want to make it clear, it could still take years for the economy to fully come back,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Think of it like building a house. You get all the big stuff done early, then some of the small things take so much longer to finish; I’m looking at you crown molding.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad market equity indices resolved a week-long balance area to the downside, albeit under weak selling. The S&P 500 index managed to one time frame lower, as evidenced by the lower highs and lows, and closed the week off below its month-to-date and week-to-date volume weighted average price benchmarks. Recapping Last Week's Action: Monday’s session closed higher without any involvement from stronger buyers. During the overnight session, before Tuesday’s regular trading, news regarding U.S. and China trade relations roiled markets. Later, statements regarding the relations were retracted, and markets retraced more than 100% of their move down. After the overnight news-driven shakeout, the market failed to find any real traction during regular trading. On Wednesday, markets liquidated on news regarding a contraction in global economic growth, later accepting prices and closing near the lows. The rotations lower were mechanical, indicative of short-term trading money. Thursday’s activity was mostly responsive, with end-of-day economic news helping fuel a spike that erased some of Wednesday’s selling. In the evening session, alongside Federal Reserve balance sheet news, markets returned to prior day value, rejecting the end-of-day spike. After the noisy overnight, markets opened Friday, liquidated and closed near the lows. Overall, despite the market losing ground, the selling was not all that intense, as evidenced by the mechanical rotations and weak migration of value. Every time the market attempted to go higher — or lower — it lacked the conviction to follow through. Though the immediate near-term trend is lower, higher prices could come just as easily on some good news. For a healthy continuation, sellers need to step up and transact in higher volumes at lower prices. You can find non-profile charts at the bottom of this story.

2020-07-01,'Trading Nation' Traders Are Bullish On Gold,"On CNBC's Trading Nation, Gina Sanchez of Chantico Global and J.C. O'Hara of MKM Partners shared their bullish view on gold. Sanchez sees the beginning of a new trend for gold, driven by debt-driven stimulus. She said that one of the biggest elements that drives gold is a direction of yields and she expects that low yields and money printing are going to have a stimulative effect on gold for years to come. The direction of the U.S. dollar could work against it, but volatility works in its favor, added Sanchez. O'Hara said that the most important driver for gold has been a real yield and as it continues to move lower, it makes gold more attractive. Real yields have been negative and declining for the majority of 2020 and O'Hara sees no end to that trend in the foreseeable future. He believes that gold could move to $1,900."
2020-07-02,Scott Nations Is Bullish On Gold,"On CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report, Scott Nations said gold's next move will be higher. The precious metal has traded significantly higher since mid-March, but Nations doesn't think it is overbought, because its RSI index is at 59. Gold is waiting for the Fed minutes, which are going to be breathtakingly dovish, said Nations. If the Fed pins certain maturities at certain yields, that would be great for gold, explained Nations. He wants to buy the August contract in gold at $1,770 and he would place a stop loss at $1,754. The target for the upside would be at $1,900. If the Fed announces lower yields as Nations expects, he is going to raise the price target and the stop loss."
2020-07-05,Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead: 'Continued Strength',"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: The S&P 500 experienced its best quarter since 1998, adding 20%. A 20% quarterly gain is quite rare, but the catch is previous large quarterly gains have actually led to continued strength. In fact, a quarter later stocks have been higher the past eight times after gaining at least 15% during the previous quarter,” LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick said in a statement. Remember This: While the risk of a national COVID-19 coronavirus resurgence remains, a more likely outcome is that localized outbreaks appear, suggested Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. Even if cases rise across the nation, most of the damage will be confined to a limited number of states, he said. As a result, without national lockdown measures, an economic recovery is likely to continue into next year, McMillan said. Pictured: profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures. Technical: Broad-market equity indices one time framed higher last week, evidenced by the higher highs and lows on the daily time frame, and closed the week off near a resistive low-volume area. Recapping Last Week’s Action: On Monday, the S&P 500 established a higher low, above the year-to-date volume weighted average price, and squeezed on good delta, through resting liquidity at and above $3,020. After Tuesday’s challenge higher, the S&P retested $3,100, a high-volume area, and balanced Wednesday, building value and acceptance of $3,100 as evidenced by the responsive intraday participation. On Thursday, the U.S. economy added greater than expected payrolls, driving prices higher at the open, before establishing excess and fading to close the gap below. Overall, though extended, the market is at an important technical level. Breaking further into the prior low-volume resistance would point to a change in sentiment, quashing the initiative activity that drove prices lower in the first place. Looking beyond the broad market indices, the innovation-driven, technology-based sectors are extended while relatively weak sectors, such as energy and financials, suggest bigger selling may be around the corner. For a continuation higher, buyers must step up on dips and increase participation in search of higher prices, helping ensure value follows closely behind.

2020-07-08,"Gold Passes $1,800 Mark For The First Time Since 2011, ETFs See Increased Inflows","Gold prices surpassed the $1,800 mark for the first time since 2011 on Wednesday as a resurgence in coronavirus infections sends investors toward safe haven investments. The Gold Landscape: The environment is still looking very good for gold and gold miners, Arnaud du Plessis, portfolio manager specializing in precious metals and natural resources at CPR Asset Management, says in an emailed note. “Central banks are staying on full alert as the resurgence of COVID-19 in some parts of the world is creating fears of a second-wave. This unique situation is generating growing interest in the barbarous relic, in the form of both the physical metal and gold-mining stocks able to offer investors potentially very significant performance leverage,” says Plessis. The profit outlook for the gold mining sector is continuing to improve, he says “Twelve-month profits have been revised up by more than 84% year on year, thus supporting the market trend. The substantial upwards revision of the average gold prices forecast for 2020, which now stand at $1,670/oz versus $1,554/oz at the end of March and $1,500/oz at the start of the year, have contributed to this trend.” Gold-Backed ETF Assets: The enthusiasm for physical gold is as strong as ever judging by the exponential growth in total gold-backed ETF assets, which reached new heights in June at 3,201 tonnes, says Plessis. “The equivalent of 86 tonnes was added in June, for example 622 tonnes since the start of the year, close to the record set in 2009 (644 tonnes for the full year). Note that the 385 tonne increase in assets in the second quarter of 2020 is the largest since 2016, “ adds Plessis. Fosterville South (OTC:FSXLF) CEO Bryan Slusarchuk says gold is a store of wealth, a hedge against uncertainty and a currency. We are in a period of quantitative easing infinity and are seeing monetary and fiscal stimuli like never before. There is huge printing of all paper currencies right now and as the saying goes, the Fed can’t print more gold. So, inherently, gold is becoming more valuable every day,” he says. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.63% at $170.10 at last check, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 1.78% at $38.40.

2020-07-08,Why Gold And Silver Stocks Are Trading Higher Today,"Shares of several precious metals companies are trading higher potentially amid market uncertainty due to growing U.S. coronavirus cases and as investors weigh continued government stimulus actions. Investors typically use gold, silver and other precious metals as a safe-haven asset when uncertainty in the market increases. As coronavirus cases continue to rise, it’s uncertain whether states will continue to reopen. Increased stimulus measures could also lead to inflation and currency debasement. See Also: Gold Passes $1,800 Mark For The First Time Since 2011, ETFs See Increased Inflows Precious metals are used in a wide variety of applications, but to investors, they’re also used as a way to store wealth.

2020-07-12,'Head Above Water': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: “It’s certainly been a wild ride for stocks in 2020,” noted researchers at LPL Financial. “Barely past the halfway point, the year has already brought the worst pandemic to hit the U.S. in over 100 years, an unprecedented government-induced recession as much of the country was locked down, some stomach-churning market volatility, and massive, unprecedented stimulus from policymakers totaling several trillion dollars” Remember This: “U.S. companies are about to give us a look into their worst quarter since the Great Financial Crisis,” suggested Lindsey Bell, Chief Investment Officer for Ally Financial's (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “Second-quarter earnings reports may not be pretty. But expectations for next year have stabilized. If investors stay more focused on next year’s earnings estimates than next week’s, the market will likely keep its head above water.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices balanced last week, evidenced by the responsive, tight trading range. Recapping Last Week’s Action: On Monday, the S&P 500 traversed higher and left minimal excess before balancing into the close. Tuesday’s session made an attempt for Monday’s high, near $3,180, but sold off, leaving value higher and closing just below the overnight low. After a quick morning liquidation, Wednesday’s session rejected prices in the lower part of the balance area and left value overlapping, with a close at the highs. Thursday responded lower, after a quick push to the $3,170 area of resting liquidity, to and through a low volume area and the prior day’s low, before squeezing back into range. Despite the high gamma expiration suggesting many names could pin, Friday opened up around a composite high-volume area, within range, and attempted lower, before responding back through the open, and repairing earlier weak highs. Looking beyond broad market indices, the innovation-driven, technology-based sectors are extremely extended while relatively weak sectors, such as energy and financials, have found it hard to come by support. Overall, the market is at an important level and will likely, based on its reaction to Friday’s close, experience volatility in the coming sessions.

2020-07-13,"Here's How Much Investing $1,000 In The GLD Gold Fund In 2010 Would Be Worth Today","Investors who owned stocks in the 2010s generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500's (NYSE:SPY) total return for the decade was 250.5%. But there’s no question some popular investments did much better than others along the way. Gold’s Difficult Decade One lagging performer in the last decade was the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The GLD ETF started out the 2010s trading at around $110. For the first year and a half of the decade, gold prices were on fire, rallying from around $1,100 per ounce to as high as $1,923/oz in mid-2011. Investors were scooping up gold on concerns that the massive stimulus action taken by the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 would eventually lead to significant inflation. Unfortunately for gold investors, that inflation never materialized and the $1,923 level represented peak gold prices of the 2010s. Given the GLD trades mostly in-line with gold spot prices, the fund peaked in mid-2011 at $185.85, its decade high. Sluggish inflation numbers, 0% interest rates and steady economic growth over the next several years made gold an afterthought for many investors. The GLD fund drifted steadily lower over the next four and a half years, eventually bottoming out at $100.23 in late 2015. For the next three-plus years, the GLD ETF traded in a mostly sideways range between around $110 and $130 before finally breaking out to the upside once again in mid-2019. The breakout coincided with concerns over the U.S. trade war with China. GLD In 2020 And Beyond The 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent stimulus efforts once again have the GLD trading higher. The fund recently hit $170, its highest level since 2012. Despite the recent rally, the GLD fund hasn’t been a particularly great overall investment in the past decade. In fact, $1,000 GLD shares in 2010 would be worth about $1,452 today. The good news for GLD investors is that if the fund continues to follow its 2008 financial crisis pattern, it will not peak for more than two years after the stock market bottom in March of 2020.

2020-07-19,Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead: 'Cautious Attitude',"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “U.S. stocks are closing in on record highs. But behind the scenes, uneasy investors are keeping their options open,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment officer for Ally Financial Inc-owned (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “They’ve bought gold at a historical pace, boosting the metal’s price to nine-year highs. Same goes for Treasuries, which is why yields are at all-time lows. Lately, we’ve seen that cautious attitude spread to the U.S. options market. A gauge of market worry (the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX) is stuck at higher-than-average levels, even though stocks are hovering just below their own highs.” Remember This: You have monetary and fiscal policy pushing the economy out of a problem and that is very, very bullish, said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Investment Management. When you have these extreme accommodative policies it is because there is a problem in the economy. Investors historically focus on the problem and are cautious, yet that’s when you want to get most optimistic. Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices balanced higher last week, as seen in the responsive, tight trading range. Recapping Last Week’s Action: On Monday, the S&P 500 gapped higher, outside of a prior balance area, but failed to continue, rotating back into the prior week’s range. Tuesday’s session continued Monday’s selling activity, but reversed just short of the prior balance area low. After news that Moderna Inc’s (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine produced antibodies, Wednesday’s session saw prices pushing higher, gapping beyond Tuesday’s range. Buyers attempted to burst through the resting liquidity at $3,230, but failed with prices later following the Nasdaq’s relative weakness lower to close the overnight gap. After some mixed economic data, Thursday's session was dominated by responsive activity, balancing out near Wednesday’s V-bottom low, with sellers lacking conviction the most via the minimal excess low. Alongside monthly options expiry, Friday’s session continued Thursday’s tone, with the intraday trading range remaining tight and responsive. Looking beyond broad market indices, the innovation-driven, technology-based sectors are showing signs of relative weakness, while other sectors, such as industrials, energy and financials are rotating higher off recent support. Overall, the market is in a three-day balance that it’s likely to break come next week.

2020-07-26,'Make Or Break': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Last Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: Stocks closed the week lower on an escalation of U.S. and China tensions, mixed reactions to earnings results, and delays in stimulus talks. Remember This: “Congress’ decision on a new wave of support could make or break the next leg of the economic recovery,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist for Ally Financial Inc's (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “With over 16 million people collecting unemployment and businesses unable to open at (or near) capacity, pulling or reducing fiscal support could lead to a deterioration in the economic improvement recently recorded.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices struggled to hold onto recent gains, evidenced by the failed continuation higher. Recapping last week’s action: On Monday, after a good amount of volatility contraction, the S&P 500 opened inside prior balance and tested lower, before rotating higher, into the gap zone left from the late February sell-off. Pre-open on Tuesday, the market rallied, further discovering prices up into the gap zone. After the U.S. cash open, Tuesday’s activity was reminiscent of rebalancing to recent overextension. On news that China would react to the closure of its consulate in Houston, Texas, Wednesday’s session saw prices push lower overnight, before turning and balancing out higher, into the close. On more news regarding geopolitics and initial jobless claims turning higher, Thursday’s session experienced a news-driven, emotional liquidation, with the Nasdaq leading lower. Friday’s session opened near a high-volume area, balancing out and trading responsively, before closing and accepting prices lower. Looking beyond broad market indices, the innovation-driven, technology-based sectors are showing signs of relative weakness, while other sectors, such as industrials, energy, and financials are finding more support. Overall, the S&P is in balance. Absent positive news regarding geopolitical tensions, monetary policy, a vaccine, earnings, and stimulus, the market may find itself correcting through time, testing the prior balance area, below $3,180, as more impactful earnings are released.

2020-07-28,3 Unheralded Gold ETFs That Are On Fire,"Precious metals, namely gold and silver, are in the midst of epic rallies. On Monday, silver exchange-traded funds extended what are becoming meteoric rises while gold hit an all-time high. On volume that was nearly double the daily average, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest bullion-backed ETF, jumped 2%. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) joined the party, too, gaining almost 5% on above-average turnover, extending its year-to-date gain to roughly 50%. Indeed, these are exciting times for gold ETFs, an arena largely dominated by GLD and GDX. However, there are some other options for investors to consider here. Let's have a look at a few here. GraniteShares Gold Trust (BAR) In the U.S., the market for physically-backed gold ETFs is mostly dominated by the aforementioned GLD, but there are some admirable competitors. One of those is the GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR). GLD is a fine choice for active traders that need tight spread, deep liquidity and a robust options market. For longer-term investors looking for cost savings, BAR and a couple of other names are the way to go. In fact, BAR, which turns three years old next month, touched of a gold ETF fee war when it debuted in August 2017. The fund charges 0.1749% per year, or $17.49 on a $10,000 investment, making it one of the least expensive funds in this category. That's meaningful as highlighted by BAR's $1.1 billion in assets under management. More importantly, the fund is up 27.73% year-to-date and hit an all-time high yesterday. U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (GOAU) Much GLD looming large in the gold-backed ETF arena, the aforementioned GDX does the same among miners funds, but the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE:GOAU) is a credible idea to consider. GOAU, which hit an all-time high Monday, devotes 30% of its weight to the three largest gold royalty companies. The remaining 70% of the ETF's weight is allocated to 25 miners scored by momentum in revenue, free cash flow and high-gross margins on a per-share. GOAU hit $100 million in assets early this month, about a month after celebrating its third birthday. VanEck Merk Gold Trust (OUNZ) The VanEck Merk Gold Trust (NYSE:OUNZ) recently had its fee clipped to 0.25% from 0.40%. OUNZ is one of the niftier ideas in the gold ETF space because when an investor sells shares of the ETF, he or she can take physical delivery of gold, a trait not offered by rival funds in this category. OUNZ gained almost 2% yesterday on volume that was nearly triple the daily average on its way to a record high."
2020-08-01,Carter Worth Weighs In On Gold And Silver,"On CNBC's Fast Money, Carter Worth said that it is all about tactical versus structural when it comes to the precious metals. He explained that structurally, the move in gold is about the currency debasement. What Happened: It is trading nowhere near the adjusted inflation of an all-time high of $2,700. But tactically it is getting a bit crowded and now is the time to hedge, Worth mentioned. Why Its Important: Gold closed higher 8 weeks in a row and historically, it has happened only 4 times before, said Worth. He explained that in a month after the move gold averaged a profit of 2.4%, while three months later it recorded an average loss of 8.9%. Six months after the move it lost 1%. Worth also showed a daily chart of SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and said that it looks steep and crowded. He thinks that it is time to hedge and take some measures. What Next: The situation is similar to iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). It managed to close 8 consecutive weeks higher only 6 times before and after these events recorded a significant drawdown. Worth explained that it doesn't have to do that, but it could be a good tactical decision to hedge. Structurally, silver could go to $50 and gold to $3,000, said Worth."
2020-08-02,'Be Wary Of Cashing In': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: Stocks closed the week practically unchanged after mixed reactions to a slew of blow-out earnings results. Remember This: “Although the stock market will certainly experience pullbacks, disappointments and corrections along the way, the horses have just begun this race and investors should be wary of cashing in a winning Superfecta ticket too early,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group. Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices held onto recent gains, evidenced by the absence of directional surprise. Recapping last week’s action: On Monday, after the prior week’s action brought the S&P 500 back to its monthly VWAP and $3,190, an area tested multiple times, participants sold the market further to Friday’s most traded price, as is usual, before impulsing higher, through the resting liquidity at $3,230, on upbeat economic news and stimulus hopes. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 attempted to eat into the poor structure left from the July 23 sell-off, prior to allocating to safety on underwhelming quarterly earnings in the European session. For the remainder of the American session, the S&P traded responsively and lower, with delta, into the close as U.S. fundamental data weakened. Intermediate-term buyer’s remained in control on Wednesday as the S&P walked it’s way higher, albeit on poor structure and participation, as the Federal Reserve reiterated a pledge to support the economy and positive earnings updates. On Thursday, after a gap down on more dismal earnings data from Europe, the S&P took a shot at some resting liquidity in the $3,200 area, prior to putting in an excess low and trading higher, behind the Nasdaq, to and through a prior low-volume area. On better than expected economic and fundamental releases out of the United States, the S&P continued its trek higher Friday, squeezing into the close, ahead of value. Despite blow-out earnings, equity indices are showing signs of exhaustion, evidenced by the uninspiring upside participation. Overall, the market appears to be digesting upside moves through time, sending mixed signals to directional traders. Moving forward, attention should be paid to upside follow-through by small-caps, energy, and financials, among other parts of the broader market.

2020-08-05,Gold At $3K? $50 Silver? BofA Raises Metal Price Targets,"Gold prices once again hit new all-time highs Wednesday after breaking the $2,000-per-ounce level for the first time ever this week. Fortunately for precious metal investors, BofA Securities said global economic conditions suggest even more upside ahead. Gold traded at $2,057/ounce on Wednesday, with silver prices at $27.03/ounce and copper prices at $2.92/pound. Traders have been flocking to gold in 2020 as a safety investment during a period of economic uncertainty. Gold is also an inflation hedge after the Federal Reserve issued trillions of dollars of stimulus earlier this year. The Fed is expected to commit to near-zero interest rates until inflation hits its 2% target. More Upside Ahead: BofA Securities analyst Michael Jalonen said he’s bullish on gold, and BofA raised its average 2021 real gold price forecast from $2,012 to $2,159. The firm also raised its 2021 real silver average price forecast from $21.95 to $30.49 and its 2021 real copper average price forecast from $2.77 to $3.10. “Continued fiscal spending as governments are mending the damage from COVID-19, backstopped by central banks means that interest rates will remain low, at the same time as the economy reflates,” Jalonen said in a note. Investors can expect gold prices to peak at $3,000 within the next 18 months, the analyst said. At the same time, he said copper prices could rally as high as $50/ounce in the medium-term. In addition to the commodity price target adjustments, BofA also upgraded Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) from Neutral to Buy and raised the price target from $8.90 to $11.25. The firm upgraded silver producer Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) from Underperform to Neutral and raised the price target from $2.40 to $6.25. Benzinga’s Take: The most pure-play trade on precious metals outside of owning the physical metals is to invest in funds such as the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) and the US COMMODITY IX/COM UT REPSTG U S C (NYSE:CPER). The GLD fund has been the best performer of 2020, with a 50.9% gain, while the CPER fund has lagged, gaining 4.6%.

2020-08-09,'A Long Way To Go': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: Stocks closed the week higher after investors regained optimism regarding a sustained recovery. Remember This: “Earnings season has been very impressive so far, now you can couple that with the employment backdrop quickly improving as well. Not a bad combo for investors,” said Ryan Detrick, chief investment strategist at the LPL Financial. “Still, let's be realistic, 10% unemployment isn't anything to get overly excited about and we still have a long way to go to get back to February levels of output.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices resolved a prior balance area to the upside, evidenced by a successful breakout and migration of value. Recapping last week’s action: On Monday, as M&A activity lifted sentiment and efforts to hammer out a coronavirus relief bill resumed, the S&P 500 moved out of a multi-week balance area, finishing further into the low-volume area left from the late February sell-off. Overnight, prices caught up to Monday’s divergent delta after disappointing earnings reports from Europe and a sharp rebuke from China. Tuesday’s U.S. session managed to get past the uninspiring news, closing higher and validating the breakout from balance. Indices continued their trek higher Wednesday, closing and establishing value above prior balance on upbeat economic data and positive earnings. Pre-U.S. open, on Thursday, the S&P filled a prior gap, finding liquidity at the $3,300 strike before climbing higher, on poor structure and ahead of value, as investors reacted to upbeat jobless claims data. Friday’s U.S. session further digested data on jobs, spending most of the cash session accepting value in the higher end of Thursday’s trading range, before squeezing into the close. In light of mostly unchanged fundamental conditions, equity indices are positioned for further upside. Overall, the market appears to be migrating value higher, confirming the bullish trend. News regarding improving fundamentals and stimulus is likely to buoy the S&P in subsequent sessions. The potential exists, however, for a fast-moving correction of the poor structure left behind by the emotional, momentum-driven participants.

2020-08-16,'A Subdued Market': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “This is a subdued market. We have recovered from the shock, but there have been a lot of sectors not really participating that much on the upside,” said ARK Invest CEO and CIO Catherine Wood. Remember This: “2020 is a year that is setting many records, some good and some bad, and now we have the best 100-day rally ever,” said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The real catch to this though is that previous big rallies usually saw continued strength, so don’t bet against this bull market just yet.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices digested prior advances, evidenced by the non-separation of value. Recapping Last Week’s Action: Monday's higher open on pandemic relief efforts coming from the White House was erased on a liquidation to Friday’s range. Buyers later responded, establishing a V-bottom before resolving the contract-adjusted all-time-high overnight. After investors shrugged off news of simmering geopolitical tensions, Tuesday’s U.S. session gave back all advances, liquidating enough to repair the poor structure below $3,330. Alongside news of resilient fuel demand, relative strength shifted to the Nasdaq Wednesday, with equity indices squeezing shorts and erasing the low-volume area left behind Tuesday’s liquidation. Thursday’s overnight activity caught up to Wednesday’s divergent delta, drifting lower alongside uninspiring political news. During the U.S. session, the S&P managed to pop higher, to and through the resting liquidity at the $3,375 area, before testing lower and closing in-range, neutral. The session’s narrative carried forward with Friday ending the week in-balance and range. In light of dull participation, the risks of a pullback have increased. Buyers lack the conviction to follow-through and sellers are beginning to step up on the liquidations that get rid of those weak buyers. The Russell 2000 closed the week off lower after coming to the $1,600 supply area. The Nasdaq, despite regaining relative strength, failed to make a new high, balancing out into the week's end. To see a positive change in tone, there needs to be separation of value beyond the all-time-high. Until then, the potential exists for a fast-moving correction of the poor structure left behind by the emotional, momentum-driven participants.

2020-08-17,"Hedge Funds Starting To Tire Of Tech, Dumping Bank Stocks","The tech rally has continued as the COVID-19 pandemic drags on, but some hedge funds are getting a little tired of tech, according to the latest round of 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Several major funds reduced or closed out their positions in some big tech names. The finance sector is also taking a beating as numerous funds dumped bank stocks during the second quarter. Tiring Of Tech Stanley Druckenmiller's Duquesne Capital is one of the funds that seem to be getting tired of holding tech. During the second quarter, the fund cut its positions in Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), Workday Inc (NASDAQ:WDAY), DISH Network Corp (NASDAQ:DISH), Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), PayPal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL), and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, Duquesne also increased its positions in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and closed out its positions in Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) Starboard Value decreased its positions in Box Inc (NYSE:BOX) and eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY), while Tiger Global reduced its position in PayPal. Tiger Global also added to a number of big tech names, including Microsoft, Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT), Amazon and Workday. The fund maintained its positions in Uber, Facebook, Netflix and Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO). Seth Klarman's Baupost reduced its positions in Facebook and Alphabet and maintained its position in eBay, but it didn't make any changes to other hot tech names. Ray Dalio's Bridgewater closed its position in Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER), although it did boost its positions in other tech names, including Alibaba, Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU), Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) and Zynga Inc (NASDAQ:ZNGA). It also added a new position in FireEye Inc (NASDAQ:FEYE). Funds Dump Banking And Financial Stocks Aside from decreasing or dumping tech, many major funds ran for the exits on banking and finance stocks. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B) especially decimated its holdings in the finance industry. The firm dumped more than 85.6 million shares of Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) and nearly 500,000 shares of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). Berkshire also sold more than 7.4 million shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) and more than 35 million shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). Other financial stocks the firm decreased its positions in include PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) and Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). Tiger Global decreased its position in Mastercard. Interestingly, Duquesne established a new position in JPMorgan Chase and US Bancorp during the second quarter. Other than selling one share of one other company, the only change the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust made during the second quarter was to dump 5 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway. Changes in gold holdings among funds One other trend in the 13F filings from the second quarter is gold. Berkshire Hathaway adding almost 21 million shares of Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) during the quarter. Interestingly, Bridgewater closed out its position in Barrick, while Duquesne maintained its position in the stock at about 4.27 million shares. There was also significant movement in the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), as 593 funds whose 13F filings are tracked by Whale Wisdom added to their position in the gold trust. Another 204 funds created new positions in it. The total number of shares owned by hedge funds tracked by Whale Wisdom grew from 144.6 million to 167 million.

2020-08-23,'Psychological Milestone': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “The market has taken us on a roller coaster ride that no one would have believed — from the depths of March 2020, when we dropped to a level last seen in 2016 (e.g., $2,237.40 on the S&P 500) to a 51% rally back to reclaim an all-time high,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance. Remember This: “We’ve officially entered a new bull market,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Financial Inc (NYSE:ALLY)-owned Ally Invest. “For some, it’s a major psychological milestone. Things still feel far from normal, but the market has successfully summited a mountain of worry. And when a new high follows a major decline, momentum tends to be on the market’s side. Since 1950, the S&P usually hits multiple record highs in the month after reaching its post bear-market peak.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices ended the week mixed, with the S&P 500 recovering its all-time high on relative strength from the technology sector. Recapping Last Week’s Action: Monday’s higher open on earnings and stimulus talks was followed by a balanced, low-volume session which migrated value to the top of prior balance. The market caught up to Monday’s delta, edging higher overnight on better-than-expected retail earnings, before liquidating, making a V-shape recovery and resolving some resting liquidity at and above the $3,390 area. On Wednesday, after the Federal Reserve signaled signs of a difficult recovery, the market left value behind on a spike and repaired some weak structure in the $3,350 region. Responsive buyers quashed Wednesday’s weak-handed initiative activity, driving prices higher into Friday’s monthly options expiration, albeit with minimal participation from the broader market. Overall, the week ended in balance again. In light of dull participation and poor structure on both sides of the market, attention has to be shifted to other stimuli, such as the cessation of a trend in heavily weighted index constituents and decreased dealer hedging flows. If momentum was to grow faint, there’s the potential for a fast-moving correction of the poor structure created by anxiety-driven participants. Still, the path of least resistance is up.

2020-08-24,3 Gold ETFs Seeing Brisk Short Covering Activity,"Thanks in large part to demand by investors opting for gold exchange-traded funds, gold is one of this year's hottest assets. However, the yellow metal, like any other security, doesn't move up in a straight line. The largest gold ETF enters Monday 6.39% off its 52-week high after trading modestly lower last week. Two interesting things to consider here. First, gold ETFs dipped last week even amid rampant short covering. Second, there's a massive amount of short interest in some marquee gold ETFs to be unwound. Three gold ETFs “landed in the top ten most short covered ETFs league table over the last week with $160 million worth of new buy-to-covers. Gold’s +28% move for the year and hitting its year to date high in early August may be squeezing some Gold ETF short sellers out of their positions,” according to S3 Partners research. Here are those three ETFs. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Up almost 40% this year, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is chastening bearish traders. Last week, the largest gold miners resisted the commodity's decline, rising 1.34% on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) took a stake in Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). That stock is GDX's second-largest component at a weight of just over 12%. More than $90 million of short interest in GDX was covered last week, but short interest as a percentage of the ETF's float is still close to 10% and valued at $1.76 billion, according to S3, meaning it will take some time for shorts to cover this trade. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) is the largest physically-backed gold ETF and a favorite of professional traders on both sides of the bullish/bearish spectrum, owing to robust liquidity and tight spreads. Traders covered almost $30 million worth of GLD shorts last week, but there's still $2.62 billion of short interest in the benchmark gold ETF, equivalent to 3.37% of the fund's float, notes S3. As is the case with GDX, it's likely to take bearish traders weeks, not days, to unwind that GLD short. iShares Gold Trust (IAU) Traders covered almost $40 million worth of bearish exposure in the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) last week, whittling short interest in that ETF $93.57 million. That's just 0.30% of the float, indicating those shorts could cover in rapid fashion if need be. “Short sellers in these three Gold ETFs are down -$760 million in year-to-date mark-to-market losses,” notes S3.

2020-08-30,'A Clear Break With Prevailing Policy': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: Last week ended positive, with broad gains in all S&P 500 sectors. Remember This: “Some data suggests consumer health has started to improve,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Financial Inc (NYSE:ALLY)-owned Ally Invest. “A consumer who’s still willing to spend on certain discretionary items has emerged. And a company that offers that consumer what they want, where they want (and feel safe), may be seeing its stock price benefit.” Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 Micro E-mini Futures. Technical: Broad-market equity indices ended the week higher, with the S&P 500 establishing a new all-time high on broad gains from all sectors. Recapping Last Week's Action: Monday’s higher open on the FDA’s approval for emergency use of antibody-rich plasma on COVID-19 patients was followed by a balanced, low-volume session that migrated value higher. On Tuesday, the market continued squeezing overnight on positive trade news and supportive delta before correcting inventory down to a prior session low-volume area and making a failed attempt at the overnight high. Wednesday’s U.S. session resolved Tuesday’s overnight weak high as investors flocked to momentum. The tone continued through Friday as the Federal Reserve’s policy shift on inflation bolstered gains in all 11 of the S&P 500 sectors. Overall, in light of the short-term, momentum-driven activity and poor structure on both sides of the market, the risks for a near-term correction have increased. That said, heavily-weighted index constituents are still in an uptrend and all sectors saw gains. As of now, the path of least resistance is still up. If the momentum were to fade, there’s the potential for a fast-moving correction of the poor structure left behind by the recent anxiety-driven activity. Scroll to the bottom of this story to view non-profile charts. Fundamental: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell unveiled a strategy that targets an average rate of inflation of 2%. “Whereas previously, the Fed would be willing to hike interest rates as the labour market approached estimates of maximum employment, Powell has made it clear that uncertainty around these estimates mean that they will not be relied upon as much in the future, Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said in a statement on the development. Instead, Powell stated ‘employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation.’ This is a clear break with prevailing policy wisdom going back as far as the 1980s — its significance is difficult to overstate.” The development comes after the Fed’s monetary policy, after the last financial crisis, failed to stimulate economic activity sufficiently to lift inflation over 2%. As a result, this new shift means the Federal Reserve will tolerate hot inflation and allow employment to drop below inflationary levels.

2020-09-07,'Deflationary Undercurrent': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: Last week ended negative on relative weakness from the technology sector. Remember This: “August benefited from multiple tailwinds, resulting in one of the best Augusts on record. Those tailwinds look stretched and at risk, however,” said Brad McMillan, CIO for Commonwealth Financial Network. “September is also historically one of the weakest months for the market, raising risks on a calendar basis, even before we consider the real possibility that the medical, economic, and market risks will reassert themselves.” Pictured: Profile chart of the Micro E-mini S&P 500 Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices ended the week lower with the S&P 500 correcting nearly 7%. Recapping Last Week’s Action: Alongside bets of an economic revival backed by prolonged central bank support, the S&P 500 established an overnight all-time high, prior to correcting lower, below value, and trading responsively into the close. On upbeat manufacturing data, Tuesday’s trade built on the prior day’s positive delta, finishing higher on a late spike. Fueled by momentum in tech, Wednesday’s session opened on a gap, accepted the prior day’s spike, and placed initiative buyers firmly in control. After a brief test lower, regular trading discovered prices higher, leaving value and delta behind. At one point sellers finally entered and established excess on a spike high, suggesting the area could be resistive on subsequent tests. Indices dropped overnight, Thursday, ahead of economic releases, catching up to the prior day’s divergent delta. After an open below the prior day’s excess, participants rejected higher prices and fueled an emotional liquidation that repaired numerous sessions worth of poor structure. In Friday’s auction, participants continued the push lower before rejecting the low-volume area at $3,400 on a virgin test, and rotating back to test the supply area near $3,460. Overall, despite the speculative call-side activity in large technology names that forced dealers to hedge in the direction of the trend, prices did manage to auction high enough to attract stronger selling. Given the immense amount of poor structure created by the short-term, momentum-driven participation, it’s no wonder why the corrective action was so fierce. Whether this sell-off is nothing more than a short-term inventory correction, the presence of additional poor structure below us, coupled with a mixed fundamental picture, suggests there may be more downside in play. That said, heavily-weighted index constituents are in an uptrend, while major market indices are in a short gamma, high-volatility environment. Regardless of trend or volatility, it’s time to closely assess how far indices have come and the potential for further upside. Scroll to the bottom of this page for non-profile charts. Fundamental: Given the market’s strength going into the U.S. presidential election, ARK Invest CEO and CIO Catherine Wood suggested the multiple structure of the market will continue rising, given the deflationary nature of innovation. “The P/E ratio of the S&P 500, right now, is at about 26 times on this year’s earnings and about 20 to 21 on next year’s earnings, said Wood. Now, we should be looking into next year -- the market is a discounting mechanism. But, to the extent a correction makes people a little more focused on the short term, they’re looking at 26 times this year, and that typically has been the top of the market.” “We’re in a deflationary world, thanks to the innovations that are sweeping through the world that are all deflationary in nature. You know the ones we talk about -- our five platforms -- DNA sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology. As they sweep through the world, there’s going to be a deflationary undercurrent, even as unit growth is very rapid. That is highly positive for P/E ratios.” Wood finished noting that investors may see multiples as high as 33 to 50 and near term corrections are a test of growth’s resilience in the new age of digital disruption and accelerated innovation.

2020-09-14,'Room For Disappointment': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: Last week ended negative on relative weakness in the technology sector. Remember This: “While valuations have hinted to overstretched markets in the past, it’s tough to say where stocks should be trading right now. We just witnessed the fastest bear market and one of the fastest recoveries on record. The Federal Reserve is more engaged in the markets than it has ever been, which has distorted reality with record-low Treasury yields.” said Callie Cox, senior investment strategist for Ally Financial Inc-owned (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “One thing is for sure: when investors’ expectations for the future rise, stocks tend to rise as well. High expectations can leave a lot of room for disappointment, and investors’ fortunes can turn quickly when markets stray too far from the economy and earnings. That’s still a major risk here, but valuations alone aren’t enough reason to expect another historic slide.” Pictured: Profile chart of the Micro E-mini S&P 500 Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices ended the week lower with the S&P 500 correcting to 3,300. Recapping Last Week’s Action: On Tuesday, alongside Brexit news, on a second attempt, the S&P 500 broke through the 3,400 low-volume area, suggesting directional conviction changed. After spending much of the day trading neutral, the S&P extended lower, in-line with delta and away from value. On news of AstraZeneca plc's (NYSE:AZN) suspended COVID-19 trial, selling continued overnight into a base of liquidity in the 3,290 region before buyers regained control and one-time framed the market higher, to and through prior value and the low-volume area broken the day prior. On Thursday’s economic data, the S&P 500 liquidated after non-convicted buyers failed to take out the prior day's low-excess high. Selling intensified as the market ate into prior low-volume, before closing off on a weak low, in-line with the prior day's cash-session low. After tech shares led an overnight rally up to some low-volume areas from the prior day's session, machine-like selling appeared and pushed the market through the weak low’s, before buyer's regained strength to finish Friday off in-range. Overall, the recent mechanical activity to and from key technical levels denotes the non-presence of larger other time frame (OTF) participants and conviction. Heavily weighted index constituents are breaking trend while the broad market’s failure to extend much lower into the poor structure below it, coupled with reduced volatility pressures, suggests immediate downside may be limited. As a result, it’s time to temper expectations and look to reposition in line with emerging macro-economic and geopolitical themes. Scroll to the bottom for non-profile charts. Fundamental: ARK Invest analyst Sam Korus suggested that the risks to auto loans, the securities supporting them, and underlying collateral may threaten the entire auto ecosystem. “The percent of auto loans delinquent by 90 days or more has been rising for almost four years and is approaching levels last seen during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, as shown below. During the GFC, most consumers and businesses prioritized the servicing of auto loans over their mortgages because, in the absence of ride-hailing, they relied on vehicles to keep their jobs and businesses going. Now working from home, they seem to be prioritizing mortgages and home equity (HE) loans over auto and credit card debt.” Korus also noted delinquencies may double while the underlying collateral will likely see a depression in residual value due to the mobility revolution. As a result, consumers, lenders, dealerships, and auto manufacturers may suffer financial damage as secular risks rebound in the tail-end of the COVID-19 recovery.

2020-09-27,'Natural Period Of Consolidation': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: Last week ended negative with mega-cap and technology stocks regaining strength into week-end. Remember This: “Markets had embedded substantial optimism in early September, with the valuation of the S&P 500 at the highest level in 20 years and sentiment at extreme highs, setting the stage for a natural period of consolidation,” noted Mark Hackett, chief of investment research for Nationwide. Investors are now struggling to find a positive catalyst, as the prospect for fiscal stimulus fades, economic data begin to reflect rising coronavirus cases and earnings season remains a month away.” Pictured: Profile chart of the Micro E-mini S&P 500 Futures Technical Broad-market equity indices ended lower with the S&P 500 correcting as low as $3,200. Recapping Last Week’s Action: Monday's test of the $3,200 high-volume area offered responsive buyers an opportunity to get in at favorable prices. Buying continued through Tuesday, before resisting an area of resting liquidity at $3,300. After disappointments in business activity data and stimulus talks, on heavy-volume and supportive delta, Wednesday's liquidation erased the entire week’s gains. Alongside improvements in home sale data, buyers in mega-caps and technology led the market higher, through Friday's close, away from value. Overall, in the bigger picture, the market is churning above $3,200, the site of a large high-volume area that denotes the market’s recent perception of value. When prices trade to a high-volume area, on a swing-up auction, then trade should slow allowing responsive longs a good place to enter. Should prices trade and spend time below this area, then perceptions have changed and longs are no longer favorable, at least in the near term. Scroll to the bottom for non-profile charts. Fundamental John Authers, a Bloomberg columnist, suggested gold is falling due to a rise in real yields. “When real yields rise then gold, which pays no income, can be expected to fall. This is true even if real yields are rising from deeply negative territory. To explain the intuition behind this, gold is widely regarded as a hedge against central banking irresponsibility. Recent speculation is that the Fed may not print money and cut rates with quite the gay abandon that had been assumed. This may or may not be good news for the U.S. economy, but it raises real yields and for investors in gold and in risk assets, who might benefit from currency debasement, it is definitely bad news.” Simply put, the theory that the Federal Reserve exhausted itself has buoyed real yields, which have an inverse relationship to metals.

2020-10-04,'Be Patient': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: Last week ended positive despite the uncertainty-driven news cycle. Remember This: “Market swings can be unsettling, and there’s a lot to think about with today’s headlines,” noted Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist for Ally Inc-owned (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “However, history has proven to us repeatedly that it’s best to wait them out. The S&P 500 has moved 2% or more in 42 trading days this year, the most since 2008, yet the index is still up year-to-date. We’re also in the early innings of an economic recovery, so we believe stocks could run higher in the coming years. But investors need to be patient because it likely won’t be a straight line up.” Pictured: Profile chart of the Micro E-mini S&P 500 Futures Technical Broad-market equity indices ended the week higher with the S&P 500 retracing 50% of the September sell-off. During Last Week’s Action: Participants defended the low-volume area -- which denotes upside directional conviction -- below $3,320. Most notable was what happened after Thursday’s failure to extend past responsive selling at the $3,370 high-volume ledge. The lack of conviction resolved itself in Friday's overnight liquidation on news that U.S. President Donald Trump contracted COVID-19, thus returning the market back into balance. Defense of the low-volume area, alongside the development of low-excess highs during the U.S. cash session, suggests the potential for further upside. Auctioning through the low-volume area, however, may trigger downside follow-through, with the S&P 500 moving as far as the $3,198 swing low.

Fundamental ARK Invest CEO and CIO Catherine Wood suggested another stimulus bill could be released prior to the election, with airlines being one major beneficiary. One problem with such a bill, however, is that the economy has hit escape velocity and some of the stimulus included may not be necessary. “We also, in terms of fiscal policy, hope that these policies are not going to get in the way of so-called creative destruction, said Wood. What we mean by that is disruptive innovation tends to take off during difficult times. But, if companies and industries are being subsidized just to hang on a little longer, that’s probably not good for anyone.” Simply put, Wood theorizes the government's stimulus of dying industries is a disservice, as it diverts resources to less productive areas of the economy.

2020-10-11,'Better Than Expected': Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead,"The Past Week, In A Nutshell What Happened: Last week ended positive alongside progress in stimulus talks. Remember This: “Very rarely in the last 10 years have we seen earnings estimates moving higher after a quarterly reporting season,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities in New York, in a conversation regarding third-quarter earnings. “That’s a very good sign. It’s a sign there’s a strong possibility this quarterly earnings season is now going to be better than expected,” he added. “The only problem is, now that we’ve entered the fourth quarter, a lot of the economic indicators are plateauing.” Pictured: Profile chart of the Micro E-mini S&P 500 Futures Technical Broad-market equity indices ended the week higher with S&P 500 retracing more than 50% of its September sell-off. During Last Week’s Action: Alongside fiscal stimulus hopes, U.S. index products initiated past and built value above a major high-volume concentration. The movement outbalance provided initiative participants (i.e., those buying within or above prior value) with greater confidence to explore higher. In moving higher, however, the market left behind numerous poor structures, suggesting much of the activity was emotional. The aforementioned short-term, momentum-driven activity is most attributable to the consensus there will be another round of stimulus. If talks were to fall apart or some other non-technical factor was introduced, there are good odds the market would endure a fast-moving correction of the poor structure. Overall, the market has moved out of balance and is resolving to the upside. Outside of some exogenous event, it is likely that the market will continue exploring higher with the S&P 500 trading up to the high-volume area at the $3,500 strike where the concentration of open interest in options is heavy. Scroll to the bottom of this story to view non-profile charts. Fundamental According to Evan Karson and Bridget Ryan of Moody’s Analytics, the economic recovery is facing two big downside risks. “Two major downside risks loom over the road to recovery that could determine which path the labor market will follow: a spike in COVID-19 cases or a fiscal policy blunder. A double-dip recession will be unavoidable if widespread contagion slows business activity materially or sparks another round of nonessential business closures. The risk of a surge is increasing as the weather gets colder and people begin to socialize inside.” Adding, a failure to deliver another round of direct stimulus payments or expand unemployment benefits would fail to buoy household spending and hit consumer-driven industries hardest. The most significant gains, though, would occur if and when a vaccine is made available. Key Events Monday: No events. Tuesday: Core Inflation Rate, Inflation Rate.

2020-10-14,Gold ETFs Aren't Beholden To Election Results,"The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, has retreated from recent highs but it's still higher by 24.37% this year. What Happened: In the run-up to Election Day, GLD and other gold ETFs could be in the spotlight, but history, including some of the recent variety, indicates GLD and friends aren't as politically sensitive as some investors believe. That could be a good thing going forward. As it stands today, investors added $21.47 billion to GLD this year, a total surpassed by only the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:VOO). Why It's Important: Buoyed by low interest rates throughout the world and a bout with equity market volatility caused by the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year, gold ETFs are on a torrid pace of asset gathering, trouncing previous records. While pre-election jitters could be a catalyst for GLD and friends, post-election is the time frame investors should examine and it looks good for gold ETFs. “The yellow metal has historically performed slightly better when a Democrat has been in the Oval Office compared with a Republican — 11.2% vs. 10.2%, respectively,” according to State Street research. “While gold appears to fare well regardless of party politics when it comes to the presidency, this does not appear to be the case for the US Congress.” Interestingly, GLD investors may want a Congressional blue wave rather than a victory by former Vice President Joe Biden because when Democrats control Congress, gold's average annual returns approach 21%, more than five times that of when the GOP is running things on Capitol Hill. What's Next: Whether it materializes in practice remains to be seen, but of the two political parties, Democrats are viewed as the more profligate spenders and that often provides some ballast for gold when that party has congressional majorities. “A standpoint of expected higher fiscal spending may help explain gold’s performance during periods when the US budget deficit as a percent of US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grows,” notes State Street. That scenario also is bad for the dollar and a weaker greenback is generally supportive of higher gold prices. Conversely, if history is an accurate guide, investors may not want to expect much out of GLD if President Trump snatches victory from the jaws of defeat. “The sentiment of uncertainty due to a new administration may be part of the reason for gold’s performance immediately following a change in leadership. Conversely, when the incumbent party retained control of the White House, gold tended to underperform against US equities and Treasurys,” said State Street."
2020-10-15,Robinhood Considers Bringing Back User Trading Data,"Popular trading platform Robinhood is considering making its customer trading data public after shutting it down two months ago. What Happened: Bloomberg reports that Robinhood is deciding whether to make its user trading data public again. “We’re looking into it,” co-founder Vladimir Tenev told Bloomberg. Tenev said he wants to get the content right, after it was removed due to third-party platforms using the data in ways that could be misunderstood. Tenev also wants to make sure the proper safeguards are in place to protect user data, according to Bloomberg. “We hear the desire to have some of that data available again.” Related Link: 50,000 Robinhood Traders Add Rocket Companies On IPO Debut Why It’s Important: As one of the most popular trading platforms, access to trading data from Robinhood could provide a snapshot of what the top-traded stocks and most-held ones are among retail traders. “It’s interesting from an information and educational standpoint,” Tenev said. Robintrack.net, a website that previously shared the data from Robinhood, created sections like a leaderboard and popular changes. A newsletter from Robintrack also shared popular changes or price movements in widely held stocks. The last newsletter published based on Robinhood data highlighted a 1,400% increase in Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK) shares and over 86,000 Robinhood traders buying the stock. Trends can also show where money is moving. The same newsletter showed a trend of Robinhood traders shifting to gold and silver via the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) and iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSE:SLV). In August, Robinhood reported daily average revenue traders (DART) of 4.3 million for the second quarter. This figure was well ahead of Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and E-Trade, with 1.8 million and 1.1 million DARTs, respectively. The total from Robinhood was more than double the rate it saw in the first quarter. TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:AMTD) came closest with 3.34 million for the companies that reported DARTs. What’s Next: Robinhood said if the platform is restored, it could come as an in-app offering. Robinhood has said it will not sell the information to hedge funds or institutional investors. A recent $200-million funding round valued Robinhood at $11.2 billion. The company continues to be a candidate for an IPO or acquisition due to its massive growth. Photo courtesy of Robinhood."
2020-10-26,How To Really Hedge Your Portfolio,"Michael Douglas and Andy Garcia star as NYC detectives in Japan in Ridley Scott's film Black Rain. Japan's Nikkei 225 index is lower now than when Black Rain premiered in 1989 (still image via Ace Black Movie Blog). Below is a recording of my presentation to the Greensboro chapter of the American Association of Individual Investors on October 17th. Here is a summary of the topics in the presentation. What Is And Isn't A Hedge A hedge is something that always rises in value when the underlying security you want to protect declines in value. That definition excludes assets some investors informally describe as hedges, such as gold. If you are long an individual stock that tumbles because it missed earnings, gold won't protect you against that. Consider a current example, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) which fell after hours on Thursday after another earnings miss. Shares of the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) weren't up after hours on Thursday. In contrast, put options on Intel will be up on Friday, if the stock opens significantly lower. Why Consider Hedging Individual Stocks I quote a JP Morgan Study which found that 40% of Russell 3000 stocks suffered catastrophic losses between 1980 and 2014. The study defined catastrophic loss as a decline of 70% or more without recovering. I also discuss how much investors should consider paying to hedge. Black Swans And Stock-Specific Risk Black Swans can drive catastrophic losses in stocks. One example which occurred during the time period of the JP Morgan study was 2008 financial crisis. Gone are Lehman Brothers and a number of independent mortgage companies such as New Century Financial Corporation. Another example of a black swan has been the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020. COVID-19 lockdowns hammered shares of real estate investment trusts such as Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG). The COVID-19 black swan also drove gym owner Town Sports International (OTC:CLUBQ) to bankruptcy while boosting the fortunes of home fitness company Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON). Black Rain And Market Risk Investors can ameliorate stock-specific risk with diversification and position sizing. However, diversification doesn't protect against market risk. Although we're accustomed to the market bouncing back quickly after a crash, that's not always the case. Japan's secular bear market has lasted so long that Nikkei 225 index now trades below where it did when the film Black Rain premiered in 1989. In the presentation, I discuss ways to hedge against stock-specific and market risk. I also discuss a way to maximize expected returns while hedging."
2020-10-31,Gold Price Predictions If Biden Or Trump Wins Presidency,"The 2020 U.S. election is taking place on Nov. 3 with President Donald Trump and former VIce President Joe Biden battling for the lead position. Gold Price Analysis: The U.S. presidential election will play a huge role in shaping the global economy and gold prices are expected to react in the run up to the election day. So how important is it for the safe haven asset gold if Biden or Trump makes it to the White House? “There is no doubt that we are likely to see increased volatility in stock markets in the run up to the election day and investors seeking traditional safe havens such as gold, particularly if the race between the two candidates gets very close and there is a growing risk of a contested outcome,” writes Saida Litosh, manager of precious metals analysis at Refinitiv. Biden or Trump Impact: If the past is any indication, a second Trump administration would mean a “turbulent and polarizing first term” which in turn would add further volatility and uncertainty, although the potential for radical policies could be lower in the second term should Congress remain divided, Refinitiv highlights. However, a Biden win would represent a return to a more conventional administration resulting in less volatility associated with political risks and international tensions. “Historically gold price movements in the aftermath of previous U.S. presidential elections suggests little evidence of a clear relationship between the gold price and the election outcome based on party affiliation,” says Litosh. Fosterville South Exploration CEO Bryan Slusarchuk says, for thousands of years, gold has acted as a hedge against uncertainty, a currency and a store of wealth. Both Trump and Biden have promised huge amounts of stimulus and huge amounts of easing. Both [Trump and Biden] have been vocally supportive of various policies that amount to quantitative easing and therefore gold ought to react well no matter who is elected,” says Slusarchuk. Stepping beyond financial conditions, which will serve to propel gold higher, we need to consider gold’s function as a hedge against uncertainty, says Slusarchuk. Gold Has Explosive Upside: Slusarchuk says this election is going to be perhaps the most divisive election in the history of the United States. It may be contested, the outcome may not be certain and its legitimacy will no doubt be challenged in some circles no matter which side is victorious,” says Slusarchuk. He believes a bitter, contested election would also potentially have many negative consequences and would represent the very definition of uncertainty which is something gold hedges against. I believe gold has explosive upside in the coming months and this is predicated on economic and financial conditions, but the uncertainty of the election outcome will only serve to accelerate its upward trajectory,” adds Slusarchuk. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.37% at $179 at the time of publication Monday, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 0.89% at $38.55."
2020-11-04,Should You Invest In Gold Right Now?,"The price of gold is up 24.2% year-to-date in one of the most tumultuous years in history so far. With the possibility of a contested U.S. presidential election and a worsening pandemic in the coming weeks, things could become even more volatile on Wall Street, leading some investors to consider buying gold as a potential hedge against stock market weakness. There are plenty of reasons to invest in gold heading into the final two months of 2020 — and plenty of reasons not to. Here's an overview of the bull and bear cases. Related: Is Gold A Good Investment? Bull Case For Gold: The bull case for gold is that it's considered a stable hedge against inflation. The U.S. government has already issued more than $2 trillion in economic stimulus this year, and a potential blue wave on Tuesday would likely open the door for trillions more in Democratic stimulus in the first quarter of 2021. Inflation rates have lagged the Federal Reserve’s 2% target rate for more than a decade, but all this money printing may catch up to the U.S. dollar at some point. If inflation spikes, gold prices will too, and gold investors will be protected from the fallout. The last time the Federal Reserve issued massive stimulus measures was during the financial crisis in 2009. Gold prices rallied from under $700 per ounce in late 2008 to as high as $1,923.70 in mid-2011. If history is any indication, the 2020 rally in gold prices could continue for at least another year or two. Bear Case For Gold: Legendary investor Warren Buffett has done a great job of explaining the bear case against investing in gold. Unlike stocks or bonds that produce earnings, generate interest or pay dividends, gold has very little actual utility. “Gold will never produce anything ... it doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you,” Buffett once said. To make matters worse, the world’s supply of gold is constantly growing. Although there is a finite amount of gold on the planet, the amount of gold available to buy and sell is increasing by more than 3,000 metric tons per year. The final case against gold is its historical performance. Since the beginning of 1990, the price of gold is up just 372.1% compared to a more than 1,700% total return from the S&P 500 in that time. How To Play Gold: The most popular way to invest in gold is the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), which tracks a gold spot price based on gold bars held in London vaults. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is a fund that holds a diversified portfolio of 54 gold mining companies. Investors can also buy individual gold mining stocks, such as Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) and Franco Nevada Corp (NYSE:FNV)."
2020-11-04,Worst-Case Scenario Off The Table? Market Experts React To Election Results,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) ripped higher by 3.2% on Wednesday as many swing states continue to count election votes. The election is shaping up to be one of the closest in history, and several analysts and experts have weighed in on what that could mean for investors in the days and weeks following Election Day. Near-Term Stimulus Risk: Bank of America economist Ethan Harris said the fact that a Democratic blue wave seems unlikely at this point has reduced the chances of a large fiscal stimulus package. “In our view, Senate Republicans are likely to be much more [fiscally] conservative if their party does not control the White House as they resist rather [than] accept the will of the President,” Harris said. Harris said the next fiscal stimulus package may now be substantially smaller if it ever even gets passed at all. Nigel Green, chief executive and founder of deVere Group, said the political uncertainty in coming days and weeks will likely be good news for bitcoin. “What we do know is that delays, legal challenges and a potentially explosive constitutional crisis in the world’s largest economy is likely to give Bitcoin a meaningful price boost,” Green said In addition to bitcoin, Green said the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and other safe-haven assets not tied to specific countries would also likely see price increases in the near-term. Related Link: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now? Long-Term Upside Ahead: Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said a Joe Biden victory coupled with a Republican Senate would be bad news for the economy in the near-term but potentially good news over the next several years. “Ultimately, a Republican Senate and a Biden presidency is still possible and although that was considered one of the worst results (assuming the House remained in Democratic control) it may be best for markets over the next 2-3 years (e.g. some gridlock and impediment to tax increases) even if it causes the most discomfort for markets over the next 2-3 months (e.g. because of a lack of significant stimulus),” Zacharelli said. At the same time, a Donald Trump victory coupled with a Republican Senate could also be good news in the long-term as long as investors avoid the near-term unwinding of “blue wave” stocks. Mizuho U.S. chief economist Steven Ricciuto said it appears likely that one party will not control the White House and both houses of Congress, which takes the most controversial policy initiatives for both parties off the table. “As such, the election has not altered our view that we will end 2021 with the S&P in the 3800-4000 area that the 10-year note will grind toward 1% by the end of this year and 1.75% by December 30 2021,” Ricciuto said. Mizuho’s year-end S&P 500 target of around 3,900 represents about 12.3% market upside over the next 14 months."
2020-11-05,'Trading Nation' Analyst Share Their Picks,"Quint Tatro of Joule Financial said on CNBC's Trading Nation that gold is ripe for further upside. He thinks the Fed is going to be less than hawkish once its targeted inflation rate is achieved, which insinuates that the Fed won't do anything even when we see a pick up in inflation. Tatro sees SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) as the easiest way to play gold, but he also likes Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM). See Also: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now? JC O'Hara of MKM Partners is thinking along the same line as Tatro, but instead of gold, he would be a buyer of bitcoin. It has a positive correlation with gold, but unlike gold it's actually breaking out, thinks O'Hara. Gold still has plenty of resistance ahead. O'Hara sees 20% of upside for bitcoin."
2020-11-06,Gold Prices Surge As Dollar Drops,"Gold has been benefiting from a weak U.S. dollar and the uncertainty of the U.S. election outcome, with Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the lead but no election calls yet. Gold made gains this week and was trading at $1,952.28 per ounce at last check Friday. While the potential election of Joe Biden means a lot to various segments of the capital markets, I think the cake was baked for gold long before the vote, said Fosterville South Exploration CEO Bryan Slusarchuk . Bull Market For Gold: Regardless of who wins the election, the setup for a once-in-a-lifetime bull market in gold was in place due to bipartisan support for quantitative easing, unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus and a low-to-negative interest rate policy, said Slusarchuk. Gold is a currency, and right now it is the only currency in the world not being printed with reckless abandon in an effort to stave off a huge financial depression, he said. Therefore, inherently gold is becoming more valuable versus its competitors every day. I expect this to continue because quite simply the Fed can’t print more gold. As the uncertainty around the election continues, gold's strength over the mid- and long-term is underpinned by economic and financial conditions. “There is no doubt we may see some short-term fluctuations based on the extreme animosity between the two sides during the counting phase of the election and the fact that the election is being contested,” Slusarchuk said. The climate represents the best set of conditions for gold ever seen, the CEO said. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.14% at $183.19 at the close Friday. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 0.49% at $41.42. Related Link: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now?"
2020-11-09,A Golden Idea Among Gold ETFs,"In the commodities complex, gold is one of this year's big stories, one that's, of course, trickling down to exchange-traded funds. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed ETF, is up 28.19% year-to-date. What Happened: What's good for gold is usually good for miners and what's good for the miners usually matriculates down to their small-cap brethren. Check out the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ), which is higher by 41.13% year-to-date. The $6.6 billion GDXJ, which tracks the Global Junior Gold Miners Index and holds 84 stocks, could continue standing as one of the preferred ways to play the yellow metal. Why It's Important: Historically, gold performs modestly when a Democrat is in the White House, the scenario investors will be seeing in the new year. Then there's speculation about rising inflation and dollar-destructive deficit spending, both of which should be constructive for gold and miners. Still, some market observers see a murky near-term outlook for bullion while remaining bullish on miners. See Also: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now? “Most believe gold and silver can perform with this market backdrop. Market agents are trying to marry a chart to an upside price fantasy,” said Rareview Macro founder Neil Azous in a recent note. “We highlight this because precious metal spot prices typically form patterns that help identify large potential moves. Currently, we see no continuation pattern that is recognizable on a chart.” What's Next: GDXJ does have some tailwinds, including rising momentum for smaller stocks and faint hopes that the dollar will strengthen anytime soon. Additionally, miners aren't just benefiting from higher gold prices. The industry is reining in costs and strengthening balance sheets, increasing the allure of GDJX for near- to medium-term investors. And for those that need a little more coaxing, Azous points out GDXJ's technical situation is somewhat attractive. “If you must add new exposure, we would instead add junior miners than spot gold,” he said. “While we are not fans of diagonal patterns, we would note that the junior gold miners (GDXJ) broke out of a downtrend channel on a weekly closing basis.” Data indicate some investors are willing to side with GDJX. In the third quarter, the ETF hauled in over $310 million in new cash."
2020-11-23,"'Halftime Report' Traders Share Their Thoughts On GLD, Mastercard And More","On CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report, Joe Terranova said SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) belongs in an investor's portfolio. He has owned the ETF for quite some time because he sees it as a pure play to gold. Jim Lebenthal doesn't think Raytheon Technologies Corp (NYSE:RTX) is too high. He sees it as a great defense company that has been held back because of its exposure to the commercial aerospace sector. He likes the stock for the next couple of years. Stephen Weiss thinks all the airlines are trading with very little divergence.

2020-11-27,Bitcoin Takes A Thanksgiving Swoon,"Bitcoin has been one of the top trades of 2020, gaining 164% year-to-date. It hasn’t been a happy Thanksgiving week for bitcoin investors, with the cryptocurrency down 10% in the last week, including a $3,000 drop in less than 24 hours. Bitcoin prices peaked at $19,783 back in December 2017. Three years later, bitcoin prices reached $19,489 earlier this week before plummeting back below $16,500 on Thursday. In Friday trading, bitcoin prices stabilized at around $16,815. Related Link: What The 5 Biggest Cryptocurrencies Of 2017 Are Worth Today What Happened: There was no clear reason for the bitcoin sell-off, but Coindesk reported that $2 billion of bitcoin derivative positions were liquidated in 24 hours this week. Some traders are already calling this week’s sell-off a healthy pullback ahead of a push to new all-time highs above $20,000. However, bitcoin skeptics are anticipating a repeat of the 2017 cryptocurrency bubble in which bitcoin prices peaked at around $20,000 before falling all the way back down to under $4,000 the following year. Inflation Hedge: One of the driving forces behind bitcoin’s big rally in 2020 has been concerns over inflation following the unprecedented economic stimulus measures by the U.S. government this year. Not only is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (Btc) (OTC:GBTC) up 124% in 2020, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is also up 17.2% this year, largely on concerns about inflation. CNBC analyst Jim Cramer recently said investors need to invest in one asset or the other. We're on a collision course, which makes me feel great about the gold I own, but I do feel that it's perfectly logical to add crypto to the menu, Cramer said. Benzinga’s Take: Younger investors seem to see bitcoin as the best alternative to cash as a store of value, but 15% to 20% price drops overnight without any clear reason don't necessarily instill confidence in investors looking for safety. Until the extreme volatility in the bitcoin market dies down, it will likely have a difficult time winning over investors looking for a safe, secure alternative to cash that won’t keep them up at night."
2020-11-30,"With Coronavirus Vaccine In Reach, Gold Faces Worst Month In 4 Years","The announcement of a vaccine protecting against COVID-19 has seen investor risk appetite rise, sending safe haven assets, including gold and the U.S. dollar, lower. The yellow metal is on track for the worst month in four years after trading at around $1,800 since mid-July. On Monday, gold was trading at $1,776. The price of gold will rise a touch as U.S. real yields fall a little further, said Capital Economics assistant commodities economist Samuel Burman. The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in China will offset any vaccine-induced boost to metals demand in 2021, the economist said. Is Gold’s Bull Market Over? The gold industry is exceptionally strong and is attracting both growth-oriented and value investors, says Fosterville South Exploration CEO Bryan Slusarchuk. It is one of the few sectors in the world that has a strong outlook for growing cash flows and growing margins in the year ahead, he said. The macro setup for gold represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for gold bulls, and it should be pointed out that when gold bullion prices are strong, gold equities often outperform the price of the metal itself, Slusarchuk says. While 2020 will be rightfully remembered for the terrible pandemic that ripped across the globe, it also marks the first time that there was near worldwide consensus amongst politicians from all political parties as it relates to spending and bigger government as a solution to cure all economic ills.” Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) lost 0.67% Monday, closing at $166.67. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) gained 1.31%, closing at $34.68. Related Link: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now?"
2020-12-07,Millennials Are Twice As Likely To Buy Bitcoin Than Gold As Safe-Haven Investment,"Unprecedented government stimulus measures, an ongoing global pandemic and a stock market at all-time highs have many investors looking for a safe-haven investment in 2020. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) has had a great year in 2020, but a new survey by deVere Group has found twice as many younger investors prefer bitcoin to gold as a store of value. The deVere survey included more than 700 of the company’s millennial clients around the world and found that 67% of them think bitcoin is a superior safe-haven asset to gold. The GLD fund has outpaced the S&P 500 in 2020, gaining 20.1%. However, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) has left gold in the dust this year, gaining 188.5% on the year. Related Link: The Libra Cryptocurrency Rebrands As 'Diem' Millennials Trust Tech: Nigel Green, deVere Group CEO and founder, said the survey suggests bitcoin may ultimately dethrone gold as the world’s preferred safe-haven investment. Green said investors are right to be concerned about central banks around the world flooding the global economies with extra money, and younger investors are increasingly turning to bitcoin to avoid the fallout. “Bitcoin has been around a little more than a decade, but already accounts for more than 3% of gold’s $9 trillion market cap,” Green said. “As the world continues to shift towards tech and as millennials become a more dominant part of the world economy, we should expect Bitcoin to also take an increasingly influential role in financial markets, especially in regard to being a ‘recession-proof’ asset.” Benzinga’s Take: One of the best arguments against bitcoin as a safe-haven investment is its extreme pricing volatility. Bitcoin’s overall performance has been great in the past few years, but its value has risen or fallen by at least 72% in each of the past five years, including a 72.6% drop in 2018. The worst year for gold prices in the past five years was 2018, when prices dropped just 0.9% on the year."

Khouw said he also noticed unusual options activity in VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and gold futures."
2020-12-16,Bitcoin Crosses $20K For The First Time. Is This Rally A Repeat Of 2017?,"Bitcoin hit a new all-time on Wednesday, topping the $20,000 level for the first time and sending the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) higher by 8.1%. Bitcoin flirted with its 2017 highs of $19,850 a couple of weeks ago before pulling back. The popular cryptocurrency took out those levels on Wednesday and was trading at around $20,523 in early morning trading. Bitcoin prices bottomed at around $3,600 back in March but have since gained around 440%, making the cryptocurrency one of the best performing assets since the market recovery began. The 2020 rally has also finally made all the buyers during the 2017 bubble profitable on their trades. Related Link: Could Crypto IRAs Replace Traditional IRAs? This Time It's Different: Nigel Green, founder and CEO of deVere Group, thinks this bitcoin rally is different than the one in 2017. “Unlike previous surges, this time around, a major price driver seems to be fuelled by the flow of institutional investors, who are steadily increasing their exposure to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” Green said. “They’re being attracted by the good returns that the digital asset class is currently offering but, more importantly, by the huge future potential it offers.” Another key driver of the bitcoin rally is concerns over the negative impact unprecedented government stimulus spending could have on the dollar. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) has also rallied 21.9% in 2020 on inflation concerns. Bitcoin investors appear to be on track for a very happy holiday season in 2020. Those that own the cryptocurrency are hoping 2021 plays out a lot better than 2018 did. The last time bitcoin made all-time highs in December 2017, its price crashed 68.3% the following year. Benzinga’s Take: Stocks, bonds, real estate and even gold have long, well-established track records of investment performance, but bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have only been around for a little over a decade. A cryptocurrency’s supply is fixed, it doesn’t have the intrinsic value of a share of stock or a plot of real estate, and it doesn’t have the yield of a bond or certificate of deposit. Therefore, the prices of cryptocurrencies in the long term will be determined only by changes in long-term demand from investors and users."

2021-01-10,4 Simple Things To Do Before Buying Your First Share Of Stock,"The stock market is on a roll heading into 2021, and trading apps like Robinhood have made it easier than ever for American investors to jump into the stock market for the first time. You don’t need to be a finance genius to start investing, but there are four simple steps each person should take before buying that first share of stock, according to Austin Root, director of research at Stansberry Research. Set Goals: First, Root says investors should define clear investment goals. If your goal is simply to have fun speculating in the market, that’s perfectly fine. But that goal involves a completely different approach than someone looking to build wealth, generate income or diversify assets. Someone looking to build wealth will likely be focusing on stocks or ETFs like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). Income investors will be looking for dividend stocks or bonds. An investor looking to diversify could be interested in commodity ETFs like the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) or the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). Related Link: S&P 500 Has Only Been This Expensive One Other Time — At The Peak Of The Dot-Com Bubble Second, Root says investors should determine their investment horizon. Someone investing for a year or less should take a completely different approach than someone investing for five years or more. Stocks have traditionally been the highest-returning asset class in the long-term, but they are also the most volatile in the short-term. The S&P 500 has historically gained between 8% and 15% annually over any 30-year stretch in history, but it frequently has drawdowns of 30% to 50% in any given year. Be Honest With Yourself: Third, Root says investors should carefully consider their risk tolerance. Could you realistically watch half of your account balance disappear in the event of a stock market crash like the one that happened in 2008 and 2009? For long-term investors, those types of sell-offs are just a bump in the road higher. But you can only overlook these drops if you have the stomach to ride out the volatility without panic-selling your investments. Finally, Root says investors need to do an honest inventory of their finances. Specifically, Root says it is unwise for anyone that has high-yield debt to buy a single share of stock until any debts with 6% interest rates or higher are paid off or consolidated at a lower rate. At the end of the day, Root says there are a lot of people out there who probably shouldn’t be buying stocks at all: “If you're primarily looking to stay wealthy ... if you have an investment horizon of less than five years ... if you can't stomach big short-term losses ... or if you currently owe debts with interest rates of 6% or more — you should not be investing in the stock market today. Full stop.” Benzinga’s Take: Fear of missing out, or FOMO, is always a powerful force driving investors at or near stock market tops. In reality, the periods of time in which making money in the stock market seems easiest are often some of the worst times to be buying stocks."
2021-01-20,"Stock Market Winners, Losers From Biden's Finance Nominations","President-elect Joe Biden is in the process of piecing together key members of his administration, and three of his potential appointees were making headlines on Wall Street over the weekend. Hard-Nosed Regulators: First, Biden announced Monday he will nominate former student loan watchdog Rohit Chopra as the new head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Chopra is currently a member of the Federal Trade Commission, where he worked to publicly push student loan companies to treat their borrowers more fairly during the Obama administration. Chopra also famously objected to a $5-billion settlement from Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) following a government probe into privacy missteps, claiming the fine imposed was not large enough. Related Link: Here's How Americans Are Spending Their Stimulus Payments In addition to Chopra’s appointment, Biden will also be nominating Gary Gensler to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gensler will be replacing Jay Clayton, who earned a reputation for being soft on Wall Street during his tenure as SEC head. Experts say Gensler will likely take a much more hands-on approach to banks, brokers and other public companies. Gensler enacted a new set of rules for swap trading at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during his tenure as chairman following the chaos that occurred during the 2008 financial crisis. He also oversaw the prosecution of several major investment banks during a Libor price-fixing scandal. Aggressive Stimulus: Finally, incoming Treasury Secretary and former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will urge Congress to “act big” in providing economic stimulus to avoid a prolonged U.S. recession. Yellen pledged her support for Biden’s recently unveiled $1.9-trillion coronavirus relief package as part of her confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. “Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big,” Yellen said in a prepared statement. Benzinga’s Take: The general consensus among economists and insiders seems to be that Biden’s regulatory team is bad news for Wall Street. Trump made a point of appointing regulators that took a hands-off approach to oversight, but Biden seems to be going in the opposite direction by selecting regulators with reputations for being aggressive. The nominations of Chopra and Gensler could be bad news for big tech stocks and banks given the two men’s histories of sticking up for consumers and investors. Big tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) could be in for a tough four years ahead. Big bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) could also be on a short leash. At the same time, Gensler’s appointment could be good news for cryptocurrencies and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) given he recently taught MIT courses on blockchain and digital currencies. The market’s positive open on Tuesday also suggests investors care more about Yellen’s bullish stimulus comments than the potential harsh regulatory environment ahead. More stimulus spending in the near-term is good news for bank margins given the yield curve is steepening. Inflation concerns could be good news for the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Infrastructure spending could benefit construction material stocks like Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC). And finally, Biden has made his commitment to clean energy very clear, which could create significant tailwinds for funds like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NASDAQ:ICLN).

2021-03-12,Beginning Investor? Here's How To Protect Your Portfolio In 2021,"A flood of new traders joined the market in 2020 thanks to the coronavirus pandemic. Most of those traders are sitting on big gains at this point thanks to a historic market rally, but much of the easy rebound money may have already been made at this point. Looking ahead to 2021, now is the time for new investors to start thinking about positioning their portfolio for the long-term. One of the best ways to protect your 2020 gains is by taking advantage of the power of diversification. Here’s an introduction to diversified investing and four tips for making sure your portfolio is diversified. Don’t Put All Your Eggs In One Basket: Even if you love a particular stock or two, putting all your money in one or two companies is an unnecessarily large risk. Lehman Brothers investors in 2007 had no idea the types of risky mortgage derivative bets banks were making behind the scenes. Enron investors had no idea the type of fraudulent accounting that was going on under their noses. Diversify your portfolio by investing in a number of different stocks in different market sectors. Mix growth stocks and value stocks, technology stocks and utilities, real estate investment trusts and SPACs, U.S. dividend stocks and emerging market stocks. Make sure you don’t miss the next hot market sector, and don’t get crushed by the next cold one. Take Advantage Of Mutual Funds, ETFs: In 2021, it’s never been easier to diversify your portfolio by taking advantage of mutual funds and ETFs. If you want to have individual stocks like Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) as core holdings, there’s nothing wrong with that. At the same time, try to allocate a large percentage of your portfolio to diversified ETFs, such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV) and the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VTI). With just one click, your portfolio can go from three holdings to hundreds or even thousands of holdings thanks to the diversification power of ETFs. Think Outside The Stock Market: Not only should your portfolio contain a diversified mix of stocks, it should also contain a diversified mix of asset classes. A truly diversified portfolio will have at least some allocation to assets such as bonds, commodities, real estate, cash, gold or even cryptocurrency. Here are some of the most popular funds to consider to diversify outside of the stock market: iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSE:AGG) SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) Vanguard Real Estate Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VNQ) Invesco Optimum Yld Dvsfd Cmd Str No K-1 ETF (NASDAQ:PDBC) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (Btc) (OTC:GBTC) Consider Your Investing Time Horizon: If you’re relatively young, you can safely take a much more aggressive approach to investing than if you are approaching retirement. From 1926 to 2018, a portfolio of 100% stocks averaged roughly a 10.1% average annual return. However, that portfolio also generated an annual net loss in 26 out of 93 years, or about 28% of the time. During the same stretch, a portfolio of 80% bonds and just 20% stocks generated an average annual return of only 5.3%, but it produced an annual net loss in just 13 out of the 93 years, or about 14% of the time. Typically, the older you are, the more conservative you want to be with your investments. Stocks are considered among the highest-risk investments, whereas certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury bonds are among the lowest-risk investments."
2021-03-27,"If You Invested $1,000 In the GLD Gold ETF 1 Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now","Investors who have owned stocks in the last year have generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) total return over the last 12 months is 74.3%. But there is no question some investments performed better than others along the way. Gold’s Disappointing Year: While the stock market has been extremely strong since it bottomed on March 23, 2020, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) ETF has been surprisingly weak. A look at the 2008-2009 financial crisis shows that following aggressive stimulus spending, investors concerned about hyperinflation sent gold prices soaring from under $700 per ounce in late 2008 to as high as $1,923 per ounce in 2011. When the stimulus-fueled hyperinflation investors feared never actually materialized, gold prices dropped back down to as low as $1,045 per ounce by late 2015. In 2020, unprecedented pandemic-driven U.S. stimulus measures once again sent gold prices soaring to as high as $2,089.20 in mid-2020. The buying was driven in large part by the same hyperinflation fears behind the previous bull market in gold from 2008 through 2011. However, this time around, investors found a new popular inflation hedge: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). Several factors led to a surge in Bitcoin buying in 2020. First, investors concerned about the potential long-term damage that trillions of dollars in federal stimulus could do to the value of the dollar have flooded into Bitcoin as a potential safe-haven play. Second, younger Americans receiving three rounds of direct stimulus payments have poured a significant chunk of that cash into investments, including Bitcoin. Related Link: If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin One Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now By the beginning of March 2020, the volatile cryptocurrency was at $8,600 after news of the coronavirus spreading in China prompted concerns about a pandemic. When the stock market bottomed on March 23, Bitcoin investors started feeling the pain. Investors who had purchased Bitcoin as a COVID-19 flight-to-safety trade were down big, with Bitcoin priced at around $5,800 at the time. But, once the government stimulus payments started flowing, Bitcoin regained its swagger. At the beginning of 2020, gold prices were hovering around $1,500 per ounce. By August, pandemic fears had pushed gold prices to new all-time highs above $2,000 per ounce. At that point, the gold rally ran out of steam. Not surprisingly, the rally in Bitcoin started to accelerate from that point forward with all-time highs above $20,000 in December 2020. By that time, gold prices were back down to around $1,800 per ounce. Gold In 2021, Beyond: Gold prices are now back down to around $1,733 an ounce, while Bitcoin surpassed $60,000 for the first time in history. The gold rally may have fizzled for now, but investors who bought the GLD ETF one year ago and held on have still managed to generate a small profit on their investment. In fact, $1,000 in the GLD ETF bought on March 23, 2020, would be worth about $1,059 today. Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve is now projecting 2.4% inflation in 2021. If inflation rates continue to rise, gold investors will be paying close attention to how gold prices react compared Bitcoin prices. (Photo by Sharon McCutcheon on Unsplash)"
2021-04-06,10 Gold Stocks That Could Be The Next Buyout Targets In Industry Consolidation Wave,"Inflation concerns haven’t delivered the gains gold investors had hoped for in the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) over the past year. However, Bank of America analyst Michael Jalonen said Tuesday the wave of M&A activity in the gold space has carried over into 2021, and he expects even more deals in coming months. Gold M&A Market Heating Up: In the first quarter of 2021, there were 15 global gold M&A deals, the most in a single quarter in nine years. In the past two quarters, there have been more than $10 billion in total gold transaction values, and Jalonen said the majority of them have been bolt-on and regional acquisitions. Jalonen doesn’t expect any blockbuster mega-mergers among senior gold producers. In fact, senior producers have been selling off non-core assets to smaller producers in recent years, which Jalonen said has increased the number of “senior mid-tier” companies with annual output of between 1 million and 2 million ounces. Related Link: If You Invested $1,000 In the GLD Gold ETF 1 Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Jalonen said exploration typically replaces more than 60% of mined reserves annually for global gold producers. “Based on the 7Moz of reserves acquired in Q1’21, another +15Moz of reserves needs to be acquired for the balance of 2021,” he wrote in a note. Jalonen said junior producers and development companies are likely the most attractive targets for large gold producers. In addition, he said companies that have stretched balance sheets and limited free cash flow could make valuable acquisitions as well. Potential Buyout Targets: Here are 10 of Bank of America’s top potential buyout targets for 2021 among junior and intermediate gold producers: Pretium Resources Inc (NYSE:PVG) Victoria Gold Corp (OTC:VITFF) Torex Gold Resources Inc (OTC:TORXF) Wesdome Gold Mines Ltd (OTC:WDOFF) New Gold Inc (NYSE:NGD) Lundin Gold Inc (OTC:FTMNF) Gold Road Resources Ltd (OTC:ELKMF) Perseus Mining Limited (OTC:PNMXF) MAG Silver Corp (NYSE:MAG) Pure Gold Mining Inc (OTC:LRTNF) Benzinga’s Take: Gold miners, particularly the type of junior and intermediate miners included among Bank of America’s top potential buyout targets, have historically been very high-risk investments. A buyout deal would certainly generate huge overnight returns for any of these stocks, but investors should remember buying a stock in hopes of a potential buyout is an extremely speculative play."
2021-04-29,Bitcoin Gaining Favor Over Gold As Retirement Planning Asset: Report,"When it comes to retirement planning, a growing number of Americans are putting their faith in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) over gold. Kiss My Asset: According to a new LendEdu survey of 1,000 adults conducted on April 21, 56% of respondents said Bitcoin was the better investment to maximize profits, while 33% said gold was a superior choice. When asked which was the superior investment product for maximizing profits on a $50,000 initial investment, 49% of respondents pointed to Bitcoin while 37% preferred gold. But that’s not to say gold has completely lost its luster. When queried on which was the better store of value to protect against inflation, 50% of respondents chose gold and 39% picked Bitcoin. And for building a nest egg on a $50,000 initial investment, 45% said they would choose gold and 42% looked to Bitcoin. See Also: The Benzinga Crypto Show ft. Dan Held, Head of Growth at Kraken Generation Gap: The survey also determined younger adults were more receptive to Bitcoin while the elders favored gold. Among the respondents, 56% of those between 18 and 24 said Bitcoin was the better speculative asset while 29% thought gold was. At the other end of the age spectrum, respondents over the age of 54 said gold was the better speculative asset, with only 29% advocating for Bitcoin. Furthermore, the 18 to 24 cohort were nearly split on which asset was the better store of value to protect against inflation, with 42% citing Bitcoin and 44% preferring gold. For the over 54 cohort, however, those percentages were 16% and 67%, respectively. Into The Future: LendEdu observed that gold’s current market cap is currently $11 trillion while Bitcoin’s is $1.1 trillion. When asked which asset would have the bigger market cap by the year 2031, 43% of respondents said Bitcoin, 32% of respondents answered gold and 13% said equal. When asked which would have the bigger market cap by 2041, 47% said Bitcoin, 29% said gold and 11% said equal. “As we head into the future, this is welcomed news for Bitcoin bulls because if enough Americans already trust Bitcoin over gold as a retirement investment, then it could mean soaring Bitcoin prices as younger Americans amass more wealth, more purchasing power, and more of a stake in the virtual currency,” said Mike Brown, LendEdu’s director of communications.

2021-05-03,Unusual Options Activity Insight: SPDR Gold Trust,"On Monday, shares of SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $167.65. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-05-07 Strike Price: $169.00 Volume: 17474 Open Interest: 1046 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Out of the money contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. Out of the money occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-05-11,3 ETFs To Play The Gold Breakout,"The gold bugs are rejoicing. A crisis on the southern border, another war brewing in the Middle East, a successful cyberattack on one of the nation's energy pipelines, and obvious signs of inflation have resulted in a flight to safety. The price of gold has risen almost 10% since early April. Many investors would like to invest in gold, but they don’t want to deal with the hassle of buying and storing it. And buying the stocks of individual gold companies can be very risky. These investors should consider gold ETFs, such as the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NASDAQ:GLD), the ProShares Ultra Gold ETF (NASDAQ:UGL), and the ProShares UltraShort Gold ETF (NYSE:GLL). See Also: Best Gold Stocks Right Now The investment objective of GLD is to reflect the performance of the price of gold bullion, minus the ETF’s expenses. UGL is for aggressive investors. It uses leverage. UGL seeks to replicate the daily investment results, before fees and expenses, that correspond to twice the daily performance of the Bloomberg Gold Subindex. GLL is designed for aggressive investors who think the price of gold is going down. It seeks daily investment results that correspond to two times the inverse of the daily performance, minus fees and expenses, of the Bloomberg Gold Subindex."
2021-06-16,Analyzing SPDR Gold Trust's Unusual Options Activity,"SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) shares experienced unusual options activity on Wednesday. The stock price moved down to $173.81 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-06-30 Strike Price: $179.00 Volume: 2551 Open Interest: 9534 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock.

2021-07-01,Gold Is A Natural Hedge Against Bad Fed Policy,"Gold doesn’t get any respect for its core attribute. Some investors think of gold as an inflation hedge because it has maintained its purchasing power over time. Others seem to think that gold is some type of hedge against a stock market crash. Yet gold doesn’t correlate with the stock market and it doesn’t move in lockstep with the Consumer Price Index. It is a hedge against the federal government making bad fiscal policy. While inflation does come about because of bad policy, it isn’t a cause-and-effect relationship with the world’s favorite shiny metal. Gold is the ultimate hedge on the government screwing up, and they have been screwing up quite a bit this new century. Since 2000 gold has handily beat stocks appreciating over 500% while the total returns of the S&P 500 are a bit north of 190%. There is no question that this is the result of the federal government spending like a drunken sailor. After the crash in 2008, the Federal Reserve decided it would be better to bail out the economy at the cost of the solvency of the US government. The credit rating agencies realized that they had to downgrade US government debt. Twenty years ago the Federal Reserve had a 6.5% interest rate target and inflation was in check. Not only was there no government deficit but the dollar was strong. This was all before the world caught the virus. Of course, I don’t mean COVID but rather the dangerous idea that we can just print however much money we want and spend it. Since then the M2 money supply has increased from 4.6 trillion to over 20.3 trillion. Fast forward to where we are today and they are pretty clearly playing monetary policy fast and loose. Interest rates are as close as they could be to zero and real returns are quite negative accounting for a 5% increase in consumer prices over the last year. Not only has the Federal Reserve purchased a wide array of government bonds and mortgage bonds but they have also taken the place of private lenders buying into the corporate bond market via ETFs. The idea of fiscal discipline has been replaced with Modern Monetary Theory running a budget deficit north of a trillion. While the problem for investors that are looking to hedge their portfolio against the bad policy is clear, the solution is less obvious. Many investors resort to gold ETFs that don’t generate any earnings or pay a yield like iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) or SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Another alternative is the Solactive Gold Backed Bond Index which has been a great solution for investors that need a fiscal policy hedge from gold and income from bonds. The index generates a consistent yield from a portfolio of investment-grade corporate bonds of approximately 2.5% then hedges that portfolio against inflation with gold. Since the portfolio has a full 100% exposure to gold it generated a historical return pre-inception on January 3, 2006, through today of 14.57% annualized. This combination of a gold hedge and bonds has beaten the total returns of both gold all by itself and bonds. The Strategy Shares Gold Hedged Bond ETF (BATS:GLDB) is designed to track the returns of the Solactive Gold Backed Bond Index and distributes a monthly yield. The other alternative that is available to some Indian investors is Sovereign Gold Bonds that are denominated in grams of gold and pay a yield of approximately 2.5% as well. Yet, US-domiciled corporate bonds seem like a safer bet than Indian government bonds for a comparable yield."
2021-07-07,Why BofA Expects Rebound In Gold M&A In Second Half Of 2021,"Despite more than $6 trillion in U.S. government stimulus spending and rising fears about inflation, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and many gold mining stocks have significantly lagged the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) since the beginning of 2020. Replacement Scramble: On Wednesday, BofA Securities analyst Michael Jalonen said lofty valuations and pandemic travel restrictions resulted in a relatively cool M&A environment in the gold space in the second quarter, but the analyst said he expects an uptick in deals in the second half of the year. Related Link: 10 Gold Stocks That Could Be The Next Buyout Targets In Industry Consolidation Wave The gold producers BofA covers collectively consume about 55 million ounces of gold annually after factoring in lost recoveries. Exploration typically replaces 70% of mined reserves each year, but producers still need to find a way to replace the other 30%. Jalonen estimates gold producers will need to replace about 15 million ounces of reserves in 2021 and will look to do it via targeted acquisitions. “Much like 2020, we would expect a renewed focus on bolt-on and regional transactions where travel is either not required or is limited,” Jalonen said. How To Play It: He said investors should look out for senior and mid-tier producers targeting smaller producers. In addition, companies that have multimillion-ounce gold projects may be attractive targets for global gold producers. Here’s a rundown of Bank of America’s ratings and price targets for senior gold producers: Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM), Buy rating and $80 target. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), Buy rating and $29 target. Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC), Buy rating and $9.50 target. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Buy rating and $80 target. Benzinga’s Take: Buyout deals often generate huge overnight returns for the takeover target, but they are extremely unpredictable. Junior and intermediate gold miners as a group have historically been very high-risk investments, and buying a stock in hopes of a potential buyout is an extremely speculative play."

2021-07-20,"Hedging Inflation Risk: With Inflation Spiking 5.4% Year-Over-Year In June, A Look At How To Protect Your Stock Portfolio.","The Inflation Threat The short-term threat is the rise in inflation. With the 5.4% spike year-over-year in June, it's getting harder to deny that inflation is now a problem in America. Granted, this hasn't been news to anyone who has filled up their car recently, but as one Bloomberg TV anchor mused during an apparent adlib on Friday about the spike in used car prices, she lives in Manhattan and doesn't have a car. Given that Manhattan is the media capital of America, this sort of insulation is probably common. Reliable And Unreliable Inflation Hedges Despite the scary inflation news, goldbugs' favorite gold ETF, the Sprott Physical Gold Trust (NYSE:PHYS) was flat on the week, as was the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) was down. A point I make in the video below is that the best hedge against inflation risk driving down the market is a hedge against the market itself going down. In that video, I use our iPhone app to find optimal puts on the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (NYSE:SPY) to hedge a $1,000,000 portfolio, but the same process could be used to hedge a $10,000 or $10,000,000 portfolio too."
2021-07-29,Options Trader Load Barrick Gold Calls Amid Rotation From Growth To Value,"Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD) gapped up almost 2% Thursday morning and continued to run higher. Rotation from growth stocks into value stocks could be starting following the FOMC meeting and Jerome Powell’s press conference on Wednesday. Although the Fed’s tone remained dovish, interest rates will eventually rise and the Fed will gradually scale back its quantitative easing which could be bullish for value stocks such as gold and silver. Following the Fed’s minutes, the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) popped 0.61% and on Thursday the ETF gapped up another 0.83%. End of summer and early fall is also a seasonally good time for metal and mining stocks and on Tuesday Barrick Gold announced it had been secured four exploration licenses from the Egyptian government to explore gold and associated minerals in the country’s Eastern Desert. The Toronto-based gold and copper miner has already expanded its exploration portfolio this year by adding property positions in Tanzania, Guyana, Japan and Nevada. Options traders believe Barrick Gold’s stock is just getting started and on Thursday purchased over $2.6 million worth of bullish call contracts. The contracts had expiry dates which ranged between Sept. 17 of this year all the way to Jan. 20, 2023. See Also: Unusual Options Activity Insight: Barrick Gold Why It’s Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays market price for the call or put option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position.

2021-07-30,Wall Street Crime And Punishment: Bre-X Minerals And The Gold Mine That Never Was,"Does crime pay? Wall Street Crime and Punishment is a weekly series by Benzinga's Phil Hall chronicling the bankers, brokers and financial ne’er-do-wells whose ambition and greed take them in the wrong direction. On March 23, 1997, the decomposed body of geologist Michael de Guzman was found in the middle of a jungle near the Busang River on the Indonesian island of Borneo. Four days earlier, de Guzman fell from a helicopter while traveling over the tropical region and local police later determined his death was a suicide. Three years before his gruesome demise, de Guzman was the center of global attention when he emerged from the same jungle with extraordinary news: the discovery of core samples of gold on property that had been purchased one year earlier by Bre-X Minerals, a hitherto obscure Canadian mining company. The initial estimates based on de Guzman’s discovery pointed to more than 136,000 pounds of gold buried beneath the jungle and one year later, de Guzman upped that estimate with a forecast of more than 2 million pounds of gold awaiting excavation. Bre-X’s Indonesian property became the most sought-after gold mining location since the California gold rush of the 1850s. The company’s stock went from trading at 30 cents a share to $250 per share, and it expanded beyond the Toronto Stock Exchange to gain access on the Nasdaq. But there was a problem: The claims made by de Guzman were a complete and utter lie. Shortly after his death, the truth about Bre-X’s Indonesian gold bonanza became known and investors who poured their money into the company realized they were victims of the greatest mining fraud in history. Bungle In The Jungle: The Calgary-based Bre-X was founded in 1989 by David Walsh, a Canadian energy industry executive. Walsh listed the firm on the Alberta Stock Exchange to finance his initial goal of mining for minerals in Canada’s Northwest Territories. For its first four years, Bre-X was not profitable. In 1993, Walsh acted on the advice of Dutch-born Canadian geologist John Felderhof to buy a parcel of the jungle on Borneo, the largest island in Indonesia. Borneo is rich in natural resources including oil, gas, lumber and coal, but gold was never found except in some isolated and insignificant amounts. The area that Felderhof recommended had previously been explored by 12 different mining companies and all rejected the territory as being absent of any major gold resources. Felderhof, who was previously responsible for finding the largest gold mine on Papua New Guinea, hired the Philippines-born de Guzman as the project manager for the Borneo operation. While the two men had worked together before, it is not certain if Felderhof was aware of de Guzman’s bizarre private life — he had four wives and families, none of whom were aware of each other, and at the time of his death, he reportedly attempted to secure the fifth marriage but was turned down by his would-be bride. Four years earlier, de Guzman was fired from a mining company job when it was discovered he was using the company’s funds to keep one of his paramours entertained. Despite living a life that seemed more suited for sitcoms, de Guzman was a respected professional in his field. But once he arrived in Borneo, he realized he was on an impossible mission and feared losing his Bre-X job after his first two attempts to locate gold came up empty. De Guzman later acknowledged that Walsh considered selling the property in order to stem his losses from the unproductive gold searches. The Man With The Midas Touch: De Guzman managed to fool his employer by salting his core samples with gold dust that he created with shavings from his wedding ring. Encouraged by this deception, Walsh directed de Guzman to continue his work. For the next two-and-a-half years, de Guzman produced thousands of core samples salted from locally panned gold that he acquired for $61,000. While de Guzman was salting his core samples, Walsh went into overdrive pitching Bre-X to institutional and retail investors across Canada, and he manipulated the Canadian media into reporting wildly positive stories about how a Calgary company found itself owning an unimaginable gold fortune. His salesmanship was peerless — he attracted 40,000 investors and moved Bre-X to the Toronto Stock Exchange. Walsh also had his eye on American money and in August 1996 he secured a spot on the Nasdaq. This was no mean feat — unlike the relatively lightly regulated Toronto Stock Exchange, Bre-X had to satisfy an eight-month investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. (SEC) that its Borneo gold discovery was legitimate. An unnamed SEC official would later tell the Wall Street Journal that the regulator was “pretty vigilant” in studying Bre-X’s application because “junior mining companies are highly speculative — they’re something we keep our eyes on.” Alas, the SEC’s vigilance did not pay off, as the company latched itself into a U.S. public listing with only a few very minor changes in its application — for example, a statement about “proved” gold reserves was rewritten to describe the supposed holdings as “mineralized deposits.” See Also: Penny Lane Meets Wall Street Three’s A Crowd: By 1996, Bre-X kept inflating the size of its potential treasure, with Walsh telling a reporter, “We all find it hard to believe that we’re responsible for the largest gold discovery probably in the history of the world.” But what Walsh did not anticipate was that someone wanted to share in his good fortune – Suharto, the Indonesian president whose concept of capitalism and democracy was very different from what Walsh experienced in his native Canada. Suharto was not convinced that Bre-X could handle the excavation of such a tremendous gold reserve and demanded the company to partner with a larger company that could handle this great task. He also wanted Indonesia to profit from the unexpected treasure found beneath its soil. Bre-X balked at the demands and Suharto withdrew the company’s excavation permits and, not surprisingly, Bre-X changed its mind. Thus, Bre-X was strong-armed into a new deal where it wound up owning 45% of the endeavor, with the Indonesian government pocketing 40% and Freeport-McMoRan, a New Orleans company brought in to dig up the gold, taking the remaining 15%. While Suharto created a financial crimp in Bre-X’s plans, Freeport-McMoRan created existential angst for de Guzman. A fire in Bre-X’s Borneo field office occurred in January 1997 shortly before the new company began its work. This fire destroyed many of de Guzman’s sampling records — while the cause of the fire was not determined and de Guzman was never accused of arson, the timing of the blaze and the items that were destroyed seemed more than a bit suspicious. In February 1997, Freeport-McMoRan conducted due diligence drilling near the site where de Guzman reported his findings, but it came up empty. Confused by the results from the drilling, Freeport-McMoRan summoned de Guzman to the Borneo site to discuss his findings. De Guzman arrived in Borneo in March while dealing with a recent diagnosis of hepatitis B. On March 19, 1997, he boarded a helicopter chartered by Bre-X to take him to the mining site, but while in flight he unlocked one of the helicopter’s doors and jumped to his death. In notes that he left behind, he defined his suicide as an escape from the pain created by hepatitis, writing, “God bless you all. No more stomach pains!! No more back pains!!” Freeport-McMoRan made its findings of a nonexistent gold reserve public in May 1997. Bre-X attempted damage control by hiring a third-party mining company, Strathcona Mineral Services, to audit the Borneo property. Strathcona not only confirmed what Freeport-McMoRan found, but added that the de Guzman core samples were clearly salted. Suharto reacted to the news by canceling Bre-X’s permits and expelling the company’s employees from Indonesia. But that was the least of Bre-X’s problems. Race Among The Ruins: Bre-X’s downfall was swift and the company took its investors on a rapid tumble. Among the institutional investors that lost substantial sums were the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan ($100 million), the Quebec Public Sector Pension fund ($70 million) and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board ($45 million). When Freeport-McMoRan announced there was no gold in the Borneo property, Bre-X’s shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange crashed by 97%, with the excessive volume caused the exchange’s computer system to break down. Nasdaq halted all trading for Bre-X, citing “concerns raised over the legitimacy of company claims.” The company would later be delisted by both exchanges. Bre-X declared bankruptcy in November 1997. The company dribbled on until eventually shutting down in 2003. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) began an investigation into the fiasco and discovered that Walsh and Felderhof each sold $25 million in Bre-X before de Guzman’s death — both men insisted they were unaware that de Guzman produced phony core samples. While the RCMP investigation was underway, Walsh relocated to the Bahamas. In May 1998, two masked gunmen broke into his home, tied him up and threatened to kill him unless he gave them his money. While Walsh was not injured in the assault and the gunmen were apprehended, this added strain on Walsh’s health was too great and he died three weeks after the attack from a brain aneurysm. The RCMP investigation ended in 1999 without criminal charges being filed against anyone within the Bre-X organization. Later that year, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) charged Felderhof with insider trading, despite acknowledging there was no evidence that he knew de Guzman’s findings were fraudulent. The trial began in 2001, was interrupted in 2003 when the OSC tried to have the presiding judge removed, and resumed in 2005 before ending two years later with a not guilty ruling. Felderhof relocated to Manila and died in October 2019. Bre-X was also the subject of a class-action lawsuit, but that was discontinued in 2014 when Ontario Superior Justice Paul Perrell ruled there was “no reasonable prospect of recovery from any of the defendants, even if the outstanding actions were successful.” The attorneys for the plaintiffs asked the court to distribute the remaining $3.5 million held by Bre-X’s bankruptcy executors and owed to the claimants be given to charity since a recovery effort would only result in claimants receiving two cents each. Perrell divided the sum between the Access to Justice Fund and the Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa. The Bre-X story was dramatized in a 2016 film called “Gold” starring Matthew McConaughey. The film followed in Bre-X's footsteps and was a flashy money-losing production. Rumors that de Guzman faked his death percolated over the years, but no evidence was ever presented to confirm that story. Prior to his death, Walsh looked back sourly at the gold mine that never was. “Four-and-a-half-years of hard work and the pot at the end of the rainbow is a bucket of slop,” he said. Photo: PxFuel."
2021-08-09,The Death Spiral Of The SPDR Gold ETF And iShares Silver ETF Continues,"Investors in gold and silver have had a rough couple of days. The price of an ounce of gold has dropped from $1,800 to current levels around $1,700. And the price of an ounce of silver has dropped from $25.50 to $23.50. Despite the fact that the precious metals have rebounded off of their lows today, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) continue to plummet. In just a week, the price of GLD has fallen from $171 to $161. If gold continues to drop, GLD should follow. SLV has dropped from $24 to $22 per share. It should continue to follow the price of silver."
2021-08-10,"Gold Is Now Technically Toast -- The Head Of Metals Strategy At MKS Weighs In. Plus, What Went Up When Gold Went Down.","Image via Time 4 Toast. Why It's Tough To Be Bullish On Gold Whenever you read investment commentary, it's useful to ask what the person writing it is trying to sell you. I sell a hedging app, so it's in my interest to highlight risks where they appear. The man who said gold is technically toast has nothing to sell you though. He is Nicky Shiels, the head of metals strategy at MKS (Switzerland) SA, and was quoted by Bloomberg in their article on gold on Monday (The Flash Crash Shows Why It's Tough To Be Bullish On Gold Now). Here is the full quote: Gold is now technically toast and requires some resilience to stave off some key levels. On the topside, retaking of $1,750 would help instill confidence. Bloomberg editor Joe Wiesenthal's takeaway on that piece, which he linked to in the tweet below, was that the macro picture didn't favor gold. Consistent with that, the silver lining mentioned for gold in that article wasn't related to the macro picture at all, but the expectation that demand for jewelry in places like India might provide support for gold prices if gold dropped too low. The article didn't mention it, but what surprised me about gold's flash crash is that it happened in an environment where Chinese data showed a huge inflationary spike. If there's any macro environment where gold should go up, it's one where we're getting prints like that. You Should Consider Hedging As I mentioned in my previous post, written before the flash crash, you should consider hedging if you have a large position in gold. I won't belabor that point now, but if you're not hedged, it may be worth hedging precious metals on a bounce. I'll try to post updated hedges here for gold or silver, using the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) or iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSE:SLV) as proxies on a bounce. Let's turn our attention now to what went up on Monday. Riot Blockchain I wrote about the Bitcoin miner Riot Blockchain, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIOT) a couple weeks ago. Riot Blockchain shares were up 8.18% on Monday as Bitcoin broke out of its three-month range. They were up 14.81% since that post was published. BioNTech I wrote about the Covid vaccine maker BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) last week, And the week before, As I noted in those articles, BioNTech was one of my system's top names on May 13th. Screen capture via Portfolio Armor on 5/13/2021. BioNTech was up 14.97% on Monday. It was up almost 36% since my August 1st post, And it was up more than 147% since it first appeared in our top ten on May 13th. Safety First If you are sitting on gains in either RIOT or BNTX, I suggest you consider hedging to lock in some of those gains. I say that not just because I have a hedging app, but because it's a prudent thing to do."

2021-09-27,"A Perfect Storm Of Risks For Precious Metals, And Yet Gold And Silver Still Lag. Why?","Nick Kwan/Pexels A Perfect Storm For Gold And Silver In theory, the past week should have been a perfect storm for gold and silver bulls, as the news fed investors a buffet of systemic risks. In one steam tray was China's Lehman Moment with the impending default of the China Evergrande Group (OTC:EGRNF). In another steam tray was the game of chicken over America's impending debt limit. Nearby, investors could find steaming dish of reported hyperinflation fears by UBS clients. And right next to the croissants, were rumors of shortages of industrial parts. Meanwhile, the rotting apple in the fruit bowl was the seemingly never-ending COVID pandemic. And Yet... Despite all that, here's how the Sprott Physical Gold Trust (NYSE:PHYS) and the Sprott Physical Silver Trust (NYSE:PSLV) ETFs had done over the last five days, as of Thursday's close. Similar picture with the more widely traded gold and silver ETFs, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). Industrial Commodities Versus Precious Metals A point we made in a recent post (Supply-Side Inflation Hits Home), is that inflation driven by shortages in the real economy would inflate the prices of industrial commodities, but not necessarily precious metals. We made a similar point in June as well (Black Gold Beats Silver) where we noted that our recent top names had included industrial commodity companies such as Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (NYSE:LPI). Screen capture via Portfolio Armor on 5/13/2021. Since then, LPI has more than doubled... While gold and silver have sucked wind, Supply-Side Inflation Versus Systemic Risk Supply-side inflation may explain the performance of industrial commodities versus precious metals over the last few months, but it doesn't explain the weak performance of precious metals in the face of putative system risks. There seem to be two possible answers here: Investors don't really see Evergrande, the debt limit, the shortages, and the bubbling inflation as systemic risks, or, Investors see these as systemic risks, but they don't see gold and silver as havens from them. Regarding the first possible answer, one could argue that foreign lenders' exposure to Evergrande, at about $20 billion, is fairly small, and we've been through the debt limit dance before without crashing through it. It's harder to reconcile the UBS survey results showing their clients' fears of hyperinflation with the recent performance of precious metals though. Which do you think is the correct answer, 1. or 2.? Or do you have a different answer altogether? Please share your thoughts in the comments."
2021-09-28,"Why Gold Isn't Going Up, But Black Gold Is: All Inflation Isn't The Same. How To Play Supply-Side Inflation.","An oil derrick at dusk. Image via Laredo Petroleum. All Inflation Isn't The Same Demand-side inflation is a surfeit of money, making money cheaper and everything else (including gold) more expensive. What we have now is supply-side inflation. We made this point earlier this month (Supply-Side Inflation Hits Home), in which we referred to economist Alan Cole post (How I Reluctantly Became An Inflation Crank). Cole quoted the soon-to-be-retired Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, speaking about a previous bout of supply-side inflation in 2011: Because my analysis suggests that recent food and oil price increases have their roots in concerns about wheat harvests in Russia and oil production in Libya and the like, I do not believe that monetary policy is the appropriate tool to respond to these disruptions. While many observers see food and energy prices rising and assume the Fed should tighten policy - raise the cost of money and credit - to head off inflation, I would suggest taking a step back and recognizing that tighter U.S. monetary policy will do nothing to stabilize Libyan oil production, reduce uncertainty about political stability in the rest of the Middle East, or increase the wheat harvest in Russia. As Cole pointed out, COVID-19 has created a similar outcome, just with different supply-side bottlenecks. Gold Versus Oil And Natural Gas An obvious difference between gold (often tracked via the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD)) and oil and natural gas is when oil and natural gas are consumed, they're gone, whereas practically all the gold ever mined on earth is still around. So supply-side bottlenecks caused by COVID had a much bigger impact on oil supplies, for example, than gold. For a while, this was partly masked by declining demand for oil due to lockdowns (fewer workers commuting, etc.), but the supply bottlenecks were significant. For example, the Baker Hughes rig count now shows 521 active drilling rigs in the U.S. That's up from 261 active rigs in September of 2020; before the COVID lockdowns in March of 2020, the U.S. rig count was 790. Bullish On Energy In 2021 We first mentioned our oil top name, Laredo Petroleum, Inc. (NYSE:LPI) here last February. We first mentioned our natural gas top name, the ProShares Ultra Bloomberg Natural Gas ETF (NYSE:BOIL) here in July (A Structural Inflation Shock). But if you didn't buy them then, it wasn't too late to make some gains. Both appeared in our top ten names at the end of August. Screen capture via Portfolio Armor on 8/26/2021. Since then, LPI was up about 94% as of Monday's close, and BOIL was up about 83%. And, as we mentioned over the weekend (Is China Repeating A 600-Year-Old Mistake?), the un-levered United States Natural Gas ETF (NYSE:UNG) started appearing among our top names in September. It was up more than 12% on Monday. Safety First As always, we suggest readers consider hedging if they are going to buy our top names, especially volatile ones such as BOIL. It was up nearly 25% on Monday, but it can swing down just as hard. We posted a video showing how to optimally hedge it with our iPhone app earlier this month. You would, of course, want to scan for a current hedge if you hedge BOIL now, but you can use the same process shown in the video above."

2021-10-11,Has Bitcoin Improved As A Flight To Safety Investment?,"Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) bulls have had a great run in the past couple of years, and many argue that the popular cryptocurrency has replaced gold as the best way to protect your portfolio from downside in the stock market. There are plenty of reasons for investors to be seeking a safe haven for their cash these days given stocks are at all-time highs while interest rates remain historically low. Diversification is the most powerful tool for any investor to help reduce risk in a portfolio. To maximize diversification, investors need to identify market sectors and assets that have minimal correlation to each other. When you have a portfolio of assets that are highly correlated, a market sell-off will likely drag down your entire portfolio all at once. However, if your assets have a low or even negative correlation, a stock market sell-off or a drop in one single market sector, such as the tech sector or energy sector, might not tank your entire portfolio. See Also: Is Bitcoin a good investment in 2021? Traditional asset classes include things like cash, stocks, bonds, real estate and commodities. Common commodities that have traditionally been considered flight-to-safety investments include gold, silver and oil. The easiest way for investors to gain exposure to many of these asset classes is by buying exchange-traded funds, such as the following ETFs: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) for stocks. SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) for gold. United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO) for oil. iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSE:TLT) for treasury bonds. Barclays iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (BATS:VXX) for market volatility. Cryptocurrency is a relatively new asset class that some investors see as a superior way to diversify a portfolio. The most popular Bitcoin fund today is the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC). Correlations: Here’s a look at the Portfolio Visualizer daily return correlation matrix for the SPY, the GBTC, the GLD, the USO, the TLT and the VXX funds. The correlations are calculated based on daily returns since January 2018. The good news is that the numbers suggest that the GBTC bitcoin fund does have a relatively low 0.23 correlation with the SPY ETF. In fact, the GBTC ETF has even less of a correlation to stocks than the USO ETF, which has a 0.39 correlation. Those arguing for bitcoin being its own asset class would point to the fact that the GBTC has very low correlation to stocks, gold, oil, treasury bonds or even market volatility, according to the table. Unfortunately, the correlation between bitcoin and the SPY is much higher than the correlation between gold and the SPY. In other words, bitcoin prices tend to drop much more than gold prices drop when the stock market sells off. The VXX volatility fund has the highest negative correlation to the SPY, but it comes with its own set of problems. Over the last five years, the VXX fund is down 77.2% overall thanks in large part to value lost via contango. The TLT, on the other hand, has a negative 0.39 correlation to the SPY and it has generated a positive 18.7% total return over the last five years. That return is not great, but its track record suggests the TLT is a much better flight-to-safety investment and hedge against stock market downside than Bitcoin at this point. Benzinga’s Take: The fact that Bitcoin prices crashed even harder than stock prices in March 2020 is all the evidence investors need to know cryptocurrencies aren’t a safe place to have your money during a stock market crash. In fact, the positive correlation between the GBTC fund and the SPY fund has actually increased from 0.12 to 0.23 since March 2020."
2021-11-26,Stocks Down On Concerns Over New COVID-19 Strain,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) traded down Friday on concerns about a new, heavily mutated COVID-19 variant. What Happened? Stocks tumbled in a holiday-shortened trading session on Friday after World Health Organization officials warned Thursday of a new COVID-19 variant that has been detected in South Africa. On Friday morning, officials in Belgium confirmed at least one case of the new variant as well. UPDATE: The WHO named the variant after the Greek letter Omicron Friday and designated it as a variant of concern. Related Link: Worried About A Market Crash? Here Are 3 Things You Can Do Why It’s Important: The new COVID-19 variant contains more mutations to the virus’ spike protein than the highly contagious delta variant. The spike protein is the part of the virus that binds to cells, and the additional mutations have scientists concerned that the new variant could potentially have more resistance to vaccines, although WHO officials said investigation of the new variant is needed. In addition to stock prices, oil prices and cryptocurrencies also took big hits as investors dumped risk assets and investments could get hit by lockdowns and travel restrictions. The United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO) was down 5.4%, while Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) prices dropped 7.1% to under $55,000. Safe haven assets traded higher on Friday morning. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 1%, while the iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) was up 1.2%. Shares of airline stock American Airlines Group Inc (NYSE:AAL) dropped 7.5%, while United Airlines Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) traded lower by 8.3%. Benzinga’s Take: The two things investors don’t want to hear when it comes to new COVID-19 mutations is anything that would potentially make the virus more deadly or more resistant to the vaccines. The U.S. currently has a seven-day average COVID-19 daily death total of 1,020, down from more than 2,000 in September and more than 3,300 in January during previous peaks in COVID-19 breakouts."
2022-01-21,Gold Is Outperforming Bitcoin And The Stock Market In The Past 3 Months: What's The Better Hedge?,"In the past three months, investors have grown increasingly concerned about the negative potential impact of elevated inflation levels and rising interest rates in 2022. But while stock prices and cryptocurrency prices have lagged, gold has outshined them both. Golden Performance: In the past three months, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is up just 1.1%, while the price of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is down 32.6%. Meanwhile, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) has quietly grinded higher by 3.9% during that three-month stretch as investors seek refuge from inflation. Despite the rise in rates and real yields, gold has held up relatively well YTD, John Lynch, Chief Investment Officer for Comerica Wealth Management, said this week. Miners [are] gathering momentum and ETF flows have been weak, so this merits watching if prices can test resistance around $1875. As of mid-day trading on Thursday, gold was trading at around $1,839.74 per ounce. Related Link: 'Risks Are Rising': Experts React To 7% CPI Inflation, Highest Since 1982 Bitcoin's Perks: But despite gold's relative strength as of late, many investors still see Bitcoin as the better longer-term inflation hedge. In fact, deVere Group’s Nigel Green recently said there are several reasons Bitcoin makes a better inflation hedge than gold. “Unlike gold, [Bitcoin] is a fixed unit of account and easily divisible and transportable. Gold is not easily immediately divisible, and there are potential issues with purity and verification. Whereas Bitcoin is easily traced on blockchain technology and this is going to be a considerable advantage, especially in cross-border transactions,” Green wrote. Benzinga's Take: The biggest pro of Bitcoin as an inflation hedge is its long-term performance, gaining more than 1,000% in the past three years alone. However, for investors looking for a safe haven from market volatility in the near term, an investment in gold may be far less stressful than buying the extremely volatile Bitcoin."
2022-01-21,Superbubble? Legendary Market Pundit Says Stocks Could Fall By Nearly 50%,"GMO co-founder Jeremy Grantham said the recent pullback in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is just the beginning of the bursting of a stock market superbubble. What Happened? In a new interview with Bloomberg, Grantham said speculation in meme stocks, joke cryptocurrencies and other high-risk assets in recent years is finally on the decline. He said market valuations are so inflated at current levels that the Federal Reserve will have a difficult time preventing the S&P 500 from dropping to 2,500, roughly a 48% drop from its all-time highs earlier this month. Why It's Important: Grantham correctly predicted the last three market bubbles and said the current superbubble is in the buy the dip mode. He also said the relative strength of blue-chip stocks in recent months compared to slumping speculative asset prices is a textbook precursor to a major market crash. You don't have two years of buying frenzy dying overnight, Grantham said. This has been exactly how the great bubbles have broken. Related Link: Gold Is Outperforming Bitcoin And The Stock Market In The Past 3 Months: What's The Better Hedge? Grantham specifically mentioned GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC), Hertz Global Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:HTZ), Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) and NFTs as examples of the type of frenzied market speculation that created the fourth U.S. superbubble. For investors looking to avoid the crash in U.S. equities, Grantham said investors should focus on value stock in emerging market economies, especially Japan. “I also like some cash for flexibility, some resources for inflation protection, as well as a little gold and silver, he said. Benzinga's Take: Investors looking to build a Grantham superbubble hedging portfolio should consider staying away from meme stocks and cryptocurrencies and buying the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (NYSE:EWJ), the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV)."
2022-01-25,The Gold Trust Rises Higher Heading Into Fed Meeting: Are Investors Leaving Bitcoin For Gold?,"SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) popped up 0.65% at one point Tuesday morning, which created another higher high to confirm the ETF is still trading in an uptrend. Gold, in the traditional financial system is considered a safe haven during times of economic crisis due to rising inflation. On Wednesday, however, the Federal Reserve will release the minutes from its January meeting where it is expected Fed Chairman Jerome Powell will provide a timetable for when and how much it plans to raise rates this year in order to combat inflation. Last October, JPMorgan analysts said in a note that it saw Bitcoin replacing gold as a financial asset. Bitcoin was trading just under the $55,000 mark at that time and shot up 25% to reach an all-time high of $69,000 over the month that followed. Since Nov. 10, Bitcoin has lost about 46% of its value, however. In comparison, the Gold Trust is up about 5% since Oct. 8 but has been volatile, swinging up and down between about $164 and $172. Traders and investors will be watching the Gold Trust tomorrow to see how the ETF reacts to the Fed’s minutes and Powell’s subsequent press conference. For technical traders, the Gold Trust has clear levels and patterns that will help to indicate the future direction of the ETF. See Also: Gold Is Outperforming Bitcoin And The Stock Market In The Past 3 Months: What's The Better Hedge? The Gold Trust Chart: Since reaching a low of $161.80 on Dec. 15, the Gold Trust has been trading in a fairly consistent uptrend on the daily chart. Within the uptrend, the Gold Trust has formed into a rising channel between two ascending parallel lines, which it has tested as both support and resistance multiple times. A rising channel is considered to be bullish until a security falls through the bottom trendline on the pattern. The channel also has a median line that can often act as support and resistance and on Tuesday the Gold trust tested the median line of the pattern and bounced. The Gold Trust’s relative strength index (RSI) is still measuring in at a fairly healthy 60% but has been slowly creeping higher as the ETF’s price increases. If the Gold Trust’s RSI reaches the 70% level it may indicate a pull back is needed because at that point the ETF would be technically overbought. Gold is trading above the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), with the eight-day EMA trending above the 21-day, both of which are bullish indicators. For short-term traders already in a position a loss of the eight-day EMA can be used as a place to stop out of the trade because the eight-day has been acting as heavy support since Jan. 19. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. Bulls want to see sustained big bullish volume continue to guide the Gold Trust higher, while keeping in mind the ETF will eventually have to print another higher low in its uptrend. There is resistance above at $174.67 and $176.63. Bears want to see a big bearish reaction following the Fed’s decision on Wednesday drop the Gold Trust through the bottom of the rising channel. There is support below the area at $170.75 and $169.33."
2022-02-11,"Ethereum Slides, Gold Surges As Russia-Ukraine Tension Ratchets Up: A Technical Analysis","Ethereum (CRYPTO: ETH) began to decline rapidly at 1:30 p.m. EST on Friday after PBS news reporter Nick Schifrin said on Twitter that, according to six U.S. and western officials, Russia will begin to invade Ukraine next week, beginning with two days of aerial bombings and electronic warfare. At that same time, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) began to shoot up, rising over 1% higher within about 20 minutes. This indicates gold is currently considered the better safe haven asset over cryptocurrencies. The crypto sector has been rebounding since Jan. 24 but Friday’s decline caused Ethereum to drop out of a rising channel, which indicates the short bull cycle could be over. The Gold Trust has also been trading higher recently, but on Friday its rise accelerated on higher-than-average volume, which indicates a high level of interest in the ETF. See Also: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin Slump After Inflation Report —What If Feds Decide To No Longer Hodl Their Stash? The Ethereum Chart: Ethereum had been trading in a rising channel since reversing course, creating a series of higher highs and higher lows as it worked its way north in an uptrend. The most recent lower high is at $2,672.84, and if Ethereum drops below the level, it will negate the uptrend and throw the crypto into a possible downtrend. Ethereum’s afternoon decline came on higher-than-average volume on lower timeframes, which indicates the bears are in control. The move lower caused Ethereum to lose support at the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA). Bulls will want to see the crypto hold above the 21-day EMA or the eight-day EMA will cross below it, which would be bearish. On Feb. 6, Ethereum broke up through a descending trendline that had been holding it down since the crypto reached a high near $4,800 on Dec. 1. The crypto may find support at the trendline if it continues to fall to the area. Ethereum has resistance above at $3,057.82 and $3,240.01 and support below at $2,890 and $2,609.02. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Gold Trust Chart: GLD reversed course into an uptrend on Jan. 28 and has since made a series of consecutive higher highs and higher lows, with the most recent higher low printed on Thursday at $170.46 and the most recent higher high created on Friday. Eventually GLD will need to pull back to print another higher low above Thursday’s low-of-day, which could provide bullish traders not already in a position a solid entry level, with a stop placed at that low. The pullback may come on Monday or Tuesday if GLD continues to run higher because its relative strength index will become extended. On Friday, the RSI oscillator was measuring in at about 64%, which is nearing overbought territory. GLD has resistance above at $174.67 and $176.63 and support below at $172.60 and $170.75."
2022-02-14,"PreMarket Prep Plus: Trading Ideas For Time Of Tension Between Russia, Ukraine","Brent Slava, head of the Benzinga Pro Newsdesk, was spot-on with his topic for Monday’s segment on PreMarket Prep Plus: trading uncertainty amid global geopolitical news.” Nervous Markets: The rising tensions between Russia and the U.S. over a potential ground invasion of Ukraine has added even more uncertainty to an already volatile market. Slava offered several issues for investors to add to their watchlist under these conditions. Potential Armed Conflicts: At this time, it is difficult to anticipate the U.S. response if Russia proceeds with an invasion. No one knows how matters could escalate if this occurs. Therefore, it is important to follow the price action of defense contractors. Slava mentioned General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD), Lockheed Martin Group (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), and L3Harris Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LHX). Cyberattacks: In the event, the potential conflict extends into cyberspace, Slava noted a few issues that may draw investor attention. Three of the more widely followed issue are Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) and CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR). Another issue linked to a potential buyout from Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT), is the former Fireeye Inc., now known as Mandiant Corp (NASDAQ:MNDT). Foreign Markets: Slava mentioned two ETFs. One, the VanExk Russia ETF (BATS: RSX), tracks Russia, and to track the impact on Europe there's the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (NYSE:VGK). Flight To Quality: Recently, gold and silver have shown signs of strength that has not been seen in quite some time as a hedge for inflation. Slava mentioned three ETFs that may have another catalyst to drive prices higher. Those are the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). It should be noted that all three are trading sharply higher as of Monday afternoon."
2022-02-24,How The Markets Are Reacting To Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) dropped 2.5% and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSE:DIA) dropped 2.4% on Thursday morning after Russia launched an attack against Ukraine. What Happened? Russia invaded Ukraine overnight, with reports of missile strikes and explosions in major Ukrainian cities, including the capital of Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said his goal is the demilitarization of Ukraine, and Russia has no plans to occupy Ukrainian territories. U.S. President Joe Biden has condemned the invasion and said the world will hold Russia accountable for its actions in Ukraine. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,” Biden said. NATO, a powerful global military alliance that includes the U.S., Germany, France and the U.K., has also announced it plans to increase its troop presence in eastern Europe. Analysis: 5 Major Economies Whose Leaders Refuse To Condemn Putin's Invasion Of Ukraine Markets React: Russia's military action has wreaked havoc on global financial markets. In addition to the sharp sell-off in major U.S. markets, the VanEck Russia ETF (BATS:RSX) crashed 23.3% on Thursday, while the Barclays iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (BATS:VXX) jumped 9.7%. Oil prices jumped nearly 8% in early trading, sending the price of Brent crude above $100 per barrel for the first time since 2014. The United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO) jumped 5.4%. The iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (BATS:ITA) held up relatively well on Thursday as investors position for a potential escalation of global military action. The ITA fund was down only 0.2% in early trading. Raytheon Technologies Corp (NYSE:RTX) traded lower by 1%, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) shares were up 0.6% and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) shares gained 2.1%. Gold, a popular hedge against stock market volatility and flight to safety for investors, gained 3% on Thursday. Gold prices climbed above $1,955, their highest level in over a year. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) traded higher by 1.5%. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), which is highly correlated to stock prices and is much more volatile, dropped 6% on Thursday to under $36,000. The price of Bitcoin is now down 33.7% in the last three months, about three times the decline of the S&P 500 in that stretch. Experts React: Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said the Russian invasion is likely the nail in the coffin for a potential 0.5% Federal Reserve interest rate hike in March. The Federal Reserve was very unlikely to do a 50 basis point rate hike for liftoff at its March meeting anyway, but the Russia/Ukraine cements liftoff to, at most, 25 basis points, Cox said. Brian Price, head of investment management for Commonwealth Financial Network, said the uncertainty surrounding the Ukraine situation likely means the fate of the market will be tied closely to Russia-Ukraine headlines for the foreseeable future. The ambiguity regarding the situation in the Ukraine will continue to challenge risk assets for the time being and it is something that investors should monitor closely over the coming days and weeks, Price said. Benzinga's Take: Between inflation at its highest levels in four decades, the Fed on the brink of a new tightening cycle and now Russia taking military action in Ukraine, there are plenty of bearish catalysts out there in the stock market. Any indication of a meaningful de-escalation in Ukraine could trigger a rebound in stock prices, but for now the market's momentum is clearly to the downside."
2022-02-25,Will Gold Reach A New All-Time High?,"Gold surged on Thursday with the news of Russia invading Ukraine and the price came within about 5% of its all-time high of $2,067 per ounce from August, 2020. Tensions have been rising at the Russian - Ukrainian border for several weeks and the gold price has been rising right along with it, currently up over $106 per ounce in the past 30 days. The major price action started late Wednesday night after Russia’s President Vladimir Putin announced that the country’s armed forces would carry out a “special military operation” in Ukraine. Gold quickly climbed to over $1,970 per ounce before dropping and ending the day Thursday at $1,906 per ounce. Why it Happened: Gold prices tend to climb along with overall uncertainties in the market, which is why gold hit its high for the day at about the same time the S&P 500 hit its low. As investors flee from equities, a lot of that money finds its way into metals such as gold, silver and platinum. What’s Next: A war in Ukraine has the potential to push inflation to even higher levels since Russia is Europe’s largest supplier of coal, gas and oil. This could cause hyperinflation throughout Europe, which won’t take long to affect the U.S. economy. What happens in the coming days, weeks and months with Russia and Ukraine is just speculation at this point. The best scenario for all involved is to see the conflict end soon, peacefully and without the loss of any more life. However, if the situation worsens and more nations get involved, it will likely send gold prices soaring again past a new all-time high.

2022-03-07,"Russia Sanctions Demonstrate Power Of The US Dollar, But How Long Will It Last?","Not only have U.S. and EU sanctions on Russia sent the ruble tumbling 38% year-to-date in 2022, but they've also once again demonstrated just how much power the dollar gives the U.S. Sanctions Pressure The Ruble: Russians are reportedly lining up to withdraw cash from ATMs, and the Russian government may not be able to make upcoming bond payments. By cutting off Russia's access to the dollar, the U.S. is choking off the lubrication its economy needs to function properly. Half of all international trade currently takes place in dollars, and about half of all the world's bonds and loans must be repaid in dollars. Incredibly, about 90% of all currency trades also involve the dollar. In the near term, the U.S. is effectively weaponizing the dollar against Russia, but the current U.S. sanctions may have a negative long-term fallout. If Russia, China and other U.S. adversaries create their own parallel trading system that doesn't involve the dollar, the dollar's age of dominance could eventually come to an end. Related Link: Russian Invasion Creates 'Upward Pressure On Inflation,' Powell Says Possible Dollar Alternatives: Fortunately, as of 2022, there aren't many viable alternatives to the dollar that are both stable and liquid. China's yuan is relatively stable, but the Chinese government's authoritarian nature can make the non-convertible yuan difficult to access for investors. International investors are also well aware that the Chinese government, not the free market, controls the financial system in China. Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have floated the idea of Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) or other cryptocurrencies as a replacement for the dollar, but Bitcoin's wild swings in price on a day-to-day basis makes it too unstable to be a short-term store of value. Still, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell seemed to acknowledge cryptocurrency's potential as a reserve currency last week when he told Congress that it's possible for the world to have multiple reserve currencies. “[The Ukraine-Russia conflict] underscored the need for Congressional action on digital finance, including cryptocurrencies,” Powell said. “We have this burgeoning industry which has many parts to it, and there isn’t in place the kind of regulatory framework that needs to be there.” Dollar Advantages: On the other hand, Citigroup recently said there are simply too many advantages to the dollar compared to cryptocurrencies at this point. Crypto to replace the role of Treasuries that stand behind the dollar? Nowhere close,” the Citigroup analyst said. “To move out of Treasuries is to give up yield, liquidity, transparency and security for what exactly?” For now, gold may be the best alternative for global central banks looking to avoid the risks associated with holding the dollar or other fiat currencies on their balance sheets. The Wall Street Journal reports that Russia has significantly increased the amount of gold it is holding in reserve since 2013, while it has decreased its U.S. dollar allocation dramatically. Bezinga's Take: So far in 2022, the global financial market has spoken, and the dollar remains the world's preferred reserve currency. The Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSE:UUP) is up 3% year-to-date, while the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 9.8% and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) is down 23.5%.

2022-03-15,Good As Gold: Investors Haven't Given Up On The Traditional Safe Haven,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is down 11.4% year-to-date in 2022, but one age-old flight-to-safety investments is holding up just fine. The price of gold is up 9.5% so far in 2022. SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 4.6% year-to-date, while the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is up 13.7%. Gold Solves This: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) bulls have had a great run the past couple of years, and many argue that the popular cryptocurrency has replaced gold as the best way to protect your portfolio from downside in the stock market. Unfortunately, market price action so far in 2022 has demonstrated that the price of Bitcoin is highly correlated to other risk assets, including stock prices. In fact, Bitcoin prices are down 26.4% so far in 2022, more than doubling the declines of the S&P 500. Related Link: What Happened To Stock Prices The Last Time Wheat Broke Above $10? A Warning To Investors There are plenty of reasons for investors to be seeking a safe haven for their cash these days, given the Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising interest rates this week, inflation is at a 40-year high and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has disrupted supply chains and raised geopolitical uncertainty. While the invasion rattled the stock market, gold prices have remained remarkably solid in recent weeks since the invasion began. Correlation And Diversification: Diversification is the most powerful tool for any investor to help reduce risk in a portfolio. To maximize diversification, investors need to identify market sectors and assets that have minimal correlation to each other. When you have a portfolio of assets that are highly correlated, a market sell-off will likely drag down your entire portfolio all at once. However, if your assets have a low or even negative correlation, a stock market sell-off or a drop in one single market sector, such as the tech sector or energy sector, might not tank your entire portfolio. Benzinga's Take: Gold has historically had a very low correlation with stock prices, making it a great way to protect your portfolio from a stock market sell-off. For investors looking for an effective inflation hedge that can hold up amid a broad stock market sell-off, gold may still be the best option in today's market."
2022-03-28,"If You Invested $1,000 In The GLD Gold ETF At Its Pandemic Low, Here's How Much You'd Have Now","Investors who bought stocks during the COVID-19 market crash in 2020 have generally experienced some big gains in the past two years. But there is no question some investments performed better than others along the way. Gold’s Bumpy Ride: While the stock market has been extremely strong since it bottomed on March 23, 2020, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) ETF has been surprisingly weak. Unprecedented pandemic-driven U.S. stimulus measures sent gold prices soaring to as high as $2,089.20 in mid-2020. The buying was driven in large part by the same hyperinflation fears behind the previous bull market in gold from 2008 through 2011. However, this time around, investors found a new popular inflation hedge: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). Related Link: If You Invested $1,000 In Bitcoin At Its COVID-19 Pandemic Low, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Several factors led to a surge in Bitcoin buying in 2020. First, investors concerned about the potential long-term damage trillions of dollars in federal stimulus could do to the value of the dollar have flooded into Bitcoin as a potential safe-haven play. Second, younger Americans receiving three rounds of direct stimulus payments have poured a significant chunk of that cash into investments, including Bitcoin. At the beginning of 2020, gold prices were hovering around $1,500 per ounce. By August, pandemic fears had pushed gold prices to new all-time highs above $2,000 per ounce. At that point, the gold rally ran out of steam. Not surprisingly, the rally in Bitcoin started to accelerate from that point forward, and the crypto hit new all-time highs above $20,000 in December 2020. By that time, gold prices were back down to around $1,800 per ounce. Gold In 2022, Beyond: Gold prices are now back up to around $1,955 an ounce, while Bitcoin is now up to above $47,000. The gold rally has been lackluster compared to Bitcoin's boom, but investors who bought the GLD ETF at its pandemic low and held on have still managed to generate a decent profit on their investment. In fact, $1,000 in the GLD ETF bought on March 16, 2020, would be worth about $1,288 today. If inflation rates continue to rise, gold investors will be paying close attention to how gold prices react, especially compared to Bitcoin prices."
2022-04-27,First Bitcoin and Gold Combo Exchange-Traded Product Is Here: Bloomberg,"The first-ever exchange-traded product combining Bitcoin and Gold has launched in Europe, offering long-term rewards and inflation protection, at least in theory, Bloomberg reports. The physically-backed index product is known as the 21Shares ByteTree BOLD ETP (ticker BOLD). It was conceptualized by Swiss crypto ETP provider 21Shares and U.K. alternative investment provider ByteTree Asset Management. What happened: According to the issuing parties, the novel ETP aims to bring together “the best of the old and new worlds of finance” by betting on the portfolio hedging power of Gold and the “strong” returns of the most well-known crypto token. Gold, the less volatile of the two assets, has a higher weighting of 81.5% at launch, while Bitcoin weighs 18.5%. The ETP rebalances both exposures in inverse proportion to their risk each month to manage volatility and increase returns. Why it’s Important: “Gold has historically delivered portfolio protection in inflationary environments, while Bitcoin is the digital equivalent of Gold with growing adoption by investors as a distinct asset class and a core store of wealth. In a time of rising structural inflation and heightened geopolitical risk, we believe this can act as an important risk and return diversifier in a balanced portfolio,” stated Charlie Erith, CEO of ByteTree Asset Management. Many market participants are still wary of Bitcoin’s suitability as a potential hedge for inflation, especially in light of the cryptocurrency’s negatively trending correlation with Gold."
2022-05-03,4 Ways To Profit Off A Falling Stock Market,"With the extreme volatility of the S&P 500's 12.1% 2022 correction, many investors are worried about where the stock market is headed next. For traders that believe the recent dip is merely the beginning of a much larger downturn, here are some potential ways to profit from a market downturn. Short Sell Individual Stocks There are two inherent benefits to owning shares of stock. One is that the market, volatile as it may be, has a general upward trend over time because of the general growth of the economy. The other advantage to owning shares of stock is that the maximum risk is capped at a 100% loss, while the reward is potentially limitless. When short selling a stock, these two advantages are flipped to disadvantages. The best-case scenario, improbable as it may be, would be a 100-percent gain from short-selling a stock that eventually goes to zero. However, if the share price of a shorted stock doubles or triples, losses can amount to multiples of the size of the initial short position. Related Link: 'Warning Sign': Experts React To Surprise 1.4% Drop In US GDP Because of the nature of their business models, the bottom lines of online brokerages such as Charles Schwab Corp (NYSE:SCHW), Robinhood Markets Inc (NASDAQ:HOOD) and Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:IBKR) tend to grow and shrink right along with the overall market, so these stocks might make good candidates for short sale during a pullback. Buy Put Options If the idea of capping your gains at 100% while still allowing for the possibility of unlimited losses does not seem appealing, another approach is to buy put options. Put options limit losses to 100% while allowing gains of much greater than 100%. The disadvantage of buying put options is that timing is critical. Not only does the price of the underlying stock need to fall for a put option to be profitable, but it must also fall before the put's expiration date. The further into the future the option expiration date is, the more expensive the time-related option premium. Buy Precious Metals One indirect way to bet against the market is to bet on something that investors tend to flock to when they are scared: gold. One of the easiest ways to invest in gold without needing a treasure chest buried in the backyard is to buy shares of the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Any time there is economic uncertainty, the price of gold tends to spike because investors view gold as something that holds intrinsic value. However, the problem with betting on a rise in gold prices during a market downturn is that the inverse correlation between gold prices and the stock market is very loose. In fact, sometimes there is even a positive correlation between the S&P 500 and the price of gold. Buy An Inverse ETF Inverse ETFs are funds comprised of stocks and derivatives that are intended to trade inversely to a particular target. Many inverse ETFs are meant to trade inversely to the broad market, such as ProShares Short S&P 500 (NYSE:SH). The advantages to owning an inverse ETF include diversification, no margin requirement, no time constraints or time premiums, and a correlation to the overall market that is nearly exactly inverse. However, even these inverse ETFs do not provide perfect inverse correlation, and the imperfect correlation can compound over time. Benzinga's Take: Although each choice has its advantages and disadvantages, investors that believe the worst is yet to come for the stock market certainly have plenty of choices for betting on further downside.

2022-06-29,US Expands Russian Sanctions With Ban On Gold Imports,"The United States has banned Russian gold imports, increasing sanctions against the country following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine in February, the U.S. Treasury Department said.

2022-07-13,US Dollar Reaches Parity With Euro: Why A Strong Dollar Is Bad News For These Stocks,"The Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSE:UUP) traded higher by 0.1% on Wednesday as the value of the dollar has climbed in-line with the value of the euro for the first time in nearly 20 years. Inflation Is King: Wednesday morning's news that the consumer price index (CPI) increased 9.1% from a year ago in June sent both the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and the Vanguard European Stock Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VGK) tumbling, but the U.S. dollar remained unscathed, rising to a 20-year high against a basket of international currencies. Related Link: US Economy Adds 372,000 Jobs In June, Another 0.75% Fed Rate Hike 'Almost A Certainty' While inflation has driven down the purchasing power of the dollar for many Americans in 2022, the dollar remains the gold standard among international currencies in a highly inflationary environment. The UUP fund is now up 12.5% year-to-date. Not only is the dollar outperforming other currencies, it is also leaving common inflation hedged Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and gold in the dust this year. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is down 5.6% year-to-date, while the price of Bitcoin has plummeted 59%. How To Play It: For stock investors, DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas said Wednesday the strong dollar is an issue worth watching heading into second-quarter earnings season. The recent runup in the dollar is a challenge for both emerging market equities and economies as well as U.S. equity sectors with high levels of offshore revenues. Tech leads that list, at 58% offshore sales, Colas said. Related Link: Hold On To Your Wallet Following Fed Minutes If Colas is correct, investors should potentially avoid the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:EEM) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) as companies report second-quarter earnings in the coming weeks.

U.S. interest rates are expected to approach 3% bhy the end of the year, while they remain near zero in Europe as a potential energy crisis looms."
2022-08-09,Gold Seeing Bullish Momentum,"On the daily price chart, it’s clear that gold topped out in March at $192 — using the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) as a proxy for gold price — and that a low of $158 came on July 21. Since then, the metal is seeing bullish momentum as it lifts up off of the lows and blasts it way back up to the $167 level before a bit of selling came in early August. The downtrend line that connects the March peak with the April high was hit last week at $167. Enough selling at this line caused a halt in the bounce into August from the July low. A close or two above that red-dotted downtrend line — maybe this week— would confirm that bullish momentum is being seen. Take a look at the weekly chart for gold: What’s revealing about looking at the weekly price chart is the way the metal clearly tested support and then bounced upward. The support line connecting the May/June 2020 lows with the March/April 2021 lows is clear. Gold tested it last week and then found buyers. It will be key for the price to remain above that line for any kind of bullish momentum to continue. So far, so good. For the record, here’s how it looks on the monthly chart: The red-dotted line that connects the late 2008 low down near 70 with the late 2015 low and then the mid-to-late 2018 low – it’s an uptrend. From this long-term viewpoint, the price of gold has been steadily bullish for years despite occasional ups and downs. Here’s an old-school point and figure chart: The benefit of viewing this type of chart is how clearly it shows the $158 level must hold for bullish gains to continue. A break below that key price support area would be a problem for those holding gold. Gold stocks followed along with the benchmark VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), peaking in early April at just above $41 and then descending along with the price of the metal to a low of $24.4 in late July. This gold stock chart is now showing a few positive divergences among basic price indicators: Note that the downtrend line that connected the April peak with the June high has been crossed on the upside by late July. The more bullish look has continued into the month of August. Also, those positive divergences are now showing up on the relative strength indicator (RSI) and the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), both seen below the price chart. It’s not guaranteed that gold price action and gold stock action will continue to look better. The most recent non-farm payrolls report will have an effect on interest rates and on general market action. Precious metals investors will want to keep a close eye on the price movement for the rest of August – but the last week or two may hold promise. Looking for ways to boost your returns?

2022-08-11,"Risk On? What Investors Buying These 4 Stocks May Reveal About The Market, Economy","The S&P 500 started 2022 with a bang, reaching a new all-time high of 4,818.62 on Jan. 4. That date would mark the top for the index, as the Santa Claus rally that had shifted into gear during late December 2021 came to an abrupt end. After the rally ended, investors were forced to take more seriously the increasingly hawkish tone to which the Federal Reserve shifted during the fourth quarter of that year as the overheated economy ran rampant and inflation soared. What Happened: The realization began to set in that the billions of dollars the central bank had spoiled the market with during the COVID-19 pandemic would undoubtedly be drained back out, inflation would be tackled with a series of interest rate hikes and, as May approached, traders and investors would have their first seasonal vacation from the markets since 2019, when the idea of a global lockdown was all but unfathomable. Bearish sentiment was perhaps late and slow to arrive. Retail traders, who began trading and investing during the pandemic during work-from-home orders with bank accounts padded by stimulus checks, had never experienced a bear market and were perhaps slow to react. Extreme fear finally hit during the five days leading up to the Fed’s June 15 meeting, during which the S&P 500 plunged almost 10% over fears the Fed would raise its target rate by 0.75%. When that fear became reality, the S&P 500 slid an additional 4% to reach a bottom at 3,636.87 on June 17. Market sentiment at that time was the lowest it had been in years. Afterall, the S&P had been on a bullish tear since the week of March 23, 2020, soaring 119.84% between that week and the first week of January 2022. But, as the old saying goes when everyone is looking one way, it’s best to look the other. It appears the adage has held true, with the S&P having rebounded over 16% since June 17. See Also: These 3 Dividend Yielding Stocks Are Warren Buffett's Top-Owned Positions In Berkshire What It Means: A blazing economy ignites inflation, leading to interest rate hikes, which in turn leads to increasing fears of a recession. During a recession, companies often struggle to maintain profitability as consumers tighten spending, and because the market is forward looking, investors begin to pull money from higher risk stocks to avoid losses caused by disappointing quarterly financial reports. Money then begins to flow into commodities such as oil, gold and silver, which began to occur in December 2021, foreshadowing the eventual downturn in the general markets. Between Dec. 2, 2021 and June 8, the United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO) soared just under 100% higher. Similarly, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) surged 18% between Dec. 15, 2021 and March 8. The two funds topped out at the $92.20 and $193.30 levels, respectively, which marked the top for oil and gold and preceded the bottom in the S&P 500. What’s Next? Bullish sentiment has slowly been returning to the general markets, with the S&P 500 in a clear uptrend on larger time frames and stocks considered to be “high risk” beginning to follow suit. Shopify, Inc (NYSE:SHOP), Snap, Inc (NYSE:SNAP), Affirm Holdings, Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) and Carnival Corporation (NYSE:CCL) are all considered to be high risk in the event of a recession because the companies' revenue streams rely on consumers having disposable income. The uptick in the four stocks may indicate recession fears are waning. After the U.S. Labor Department released its consumer price index data Wednesday showing that inflation may have peaked, Shopify, Snap, Affirm and Carnival reacted bullishly, indicating investors may be ready to take on more risk and the bear cycle may be coming to an end. For the month of August, Shopify, a Canada-based e-commerce giant, is up about 17%. Snapchat parent Snap has increased over 14%. Similarly, Affirm, a financial lender of installment loans that would suffer during periods of rising interest rates, has soared over 43% since Aug. 1. Carnival, a cruise line operator, is up 18%. The Benzinga Take: Although the markets are bullish for the time being, upswings take place during every longer-term bearish cycle. The S&P 500 crossed below the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) on April 6, throwing the ETF into a bear cycle, which for technical traders was predicted by a death cross on the fund’s chart, which came on March 14. The S&P 500 is trading about 2.3% below the 200-day SMA, and if the ETF can regain the area as support, the 50-day SMA will eventually cross above the 200-day, which will cause a golden cross to form and will give bullish traders more confidence a true bull cycle is on the horizon."
2022-08-15,"Analyst Cuts Price Targets For These Gold Stocks, Names Agnico Eagle Top Pick","Second-quarter earnings season was mostly bad news for North American precious metal miners. Several producers lowered their guidance for the second half of the year, and Bank of America analyst Lawson Winder lowered his price target for a handful of gold and silver miners on Monday. Updated Targets: Winder made the following changes to gold and silver stocks under his coverage: Centerra Gold Inc. (NYSE:CGAU), reiterated Underperform rating, price target cut from $6.30 to $5.60. Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE:PAAS), reiterated Buy rating, price target cut from $25 to $22. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), reiterated Buy rating, price target cut from $27.25 to $27.

Top Pick: He named Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM) his top stock pick in the precious metal mining group. AEM is a stand-out with unchanged 2022 production and cost guidance (unlike many peers), is delivering well on Kirkland Lake merger synergies, and a focus on increasing reserve life by way of exploration, Winder said.

Benzinga's Take: Gold certainly hasn't been the classic inflation hedge investors have been looking for in 2022.

2022-09-26,How The FOMC Announcement Affected Precious Metal Prices,"Precious metals stocks and precious metals reacted positively to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s announcement that interest rates will by 0.75%. Because this sector is traditionally considered an inflation hedge — although not so much lately — the slightly upward move may be a little surprising. Taking rates higher is designed to stop inflationary trends. The daily price chart of the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) looked like this at the close Wednesday: The bullish engulfing candlestick — where the price goes lower than the previous day and then closes higher — is said to be a good sign. The relative strength indicator (RSI) and the moving average convergence/divergence indicator (MACD) in below the price chart are forming positive divergences to price. SPDR Gold shares closed up 0.46%. iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) closed up 1.86%, outperforming gold and with improved trading volume. Although it’s probably early to say that the price of silver has bottomed, it’s clear that both the RSI and the MACD are showing positive divergences to recent price lows — a good sign, according to standard technical analysis. The VanEck Sector Gold Miners Exchange Traded Fund (NYSE:GDX), a diversified collection of gold stocks, closed higher by 0.34% Wednesday. While it’s not much higher, it’s not down after Powell’s anti-inflationary rate hike remarks. Although the MACD indicator suggests the potential for a bottom, the RSI is not quite there yet to confirm it. Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM) is the largest precious metals operation traded on the New York Stock Exchange and closely followed as a bellwether for the sector. The stock closed lower by 0.93% Wednesday, tamping down whatever bullishness might have been evident in the sector. Note that Newmont managed to remain above the late August/early September lows and that both the RSI and MACD indicators are in positive divergence mode. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) is the other large mining company widely followed by the precious metals crowd. Barrick closed higher by 0.86%, a different kind of look than Newmont’s close after Powell’s announcements. This precious metals stock has a chart showing positive divergences on both the relative strength indicator and with the moving average convergence/divergence indicator. October’s consumer price index and producer price index readings might be the next catalyst for this sector. Expectations about those inflation readings will affect gold and silver stocks until then.

2022-09-29,SPDR Gold Trust Consolidates As Bank Of England Seeks To Stabilize Markets,"The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) experienced some volatility intraday trading up and down within Wednesday’s range. Gold, which correlates to bond prices, has been in decline recently, while yields have soared. Yields, which track inversely to gold, have been rising amid a series of 0.75% interest rate hikes as the Federal Reserve continues in its attempt to bring down inflation. On Wednesday, the Bank of England announced it will cease selling bonds next week and start to purchase long-dated bonds. The U.K. stock market has experienced high volatility recently, which could impact the U.S. markets. The move to purchacse bonds is an attempt to stabilize the markets. See Also: Bank Of England Begins Purchasing UK Bonds To Stabilize Market, 10-Year US Treasury Rates Hit 4% GLD is trading down about 20% from its March 8 high of $193.30, where the fund printed a bearish double top pattern when paired similar price action on Aug. 6, 2020 that occurred at the all-time high of $194.45. A double top pattern is a reversal indicator that shows a stock has reached a key resistance level, retraced lower, back tested the level as resistance and is likely to retrace again. It is possible the stock or fund may retest the level as resistance again creating a triple top or even quadruple top pattern. The formation is always identified after a security has reached a price and is at the top of an uptrend whereas a bullish double bottom pattern is always found in a downtrend. A spike in volume confirms the double top pattern was recognized and subsequent increasing volume may indicate the stock will retrace into a downtrend. Aggressive bearish traders may choose to take a position when the stock’s volume spikes after the second retest of the resistance level. Conservative bearish traders may wait to take a position when the stock’s share price has dropped below the level of the second rebound (the high of the first bounce after the double top has formed). Bullish traders may choose to take a position if the stock surpasses the level at which the double top was formed, which can indicate a larger reversal to the upside is on the horizon.

The inside bar broke up bullish on Wednesday and on Thursday, the fund was printing another inside bar pattern. The most recent inside bar leans bullish because GLD was trading higher before forming the pattern but traders can watch for a break up or down from Wednesday’s mother bar later on Thursday or on Friday to gauge future direction. If GLD breaks up bullishly from the inside bar pattern, the fund will regain the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA), which will give bullish traders more confidence. If the fund can hold above the level for a period of time, a possible bear flag that has developed on GLD will also be negated. GLD has resistance above at $157.32 and $160.57 and support below at $154.34 and $151.23. See Also: British Pound Drops To All-Time Lows: 'Existential Crisis Is Looming'"

2022-10-10,Saudi Aramco To Maintain Oil Deliveries To Asian Clients Despite OPEC+ Cuts,"Saudi Aramco said it would maintain contract oil volumes to clients in Asia despite the recently agreed OPEC+ production cuts, despite the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia (OPEC+), to lower their output target by 2 million barrels per day (BPD). Saudi energy minister Abdulaziz bin Salman said the actual output reduction would be around 1 million-1.1 million BPD. Most of the reduction will be implemented by Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., and Kuwait, Reuters reported. Most of the extended alliance members are already producing below their targets. Consultancy FGE expects the Saudi oil production target to fall by around 550,000 BPD in November from the previous month. Aramco has also kept November crude prices for Asia largely unchanged against expectations of higher prices as it seeks to maintain market share in the region. The White House responded to OPEC+'s historic reduction of oil, to which President Joe Biden said he is disappointed in the shortsighted decision by the coalition to cut production quotas in the current uncertain macro and geopolitical environment."

What Happened: Elliott said that in a month when financial assets in aggregate have performed poorly and bond yields have risen, gold has outperformed. Similarly, in a year when financial assets have performed poorly and bond yields have risen, the yellow metal has outperformed, he said in a tweet. See Also: How To Invest In Startups “Gold is non-interest bearing money, so it should perform poorly as rates rise and does so in the wiggles,” Elliott tweeted adding, that the reason it hasn’t fallen over time is that it also serves as protection as tailed scenarios become increasingly priced-in, including very high or very low inflation. In a month when financial assets in aggregate have performed poorly and bond yields have risen, gold has outperformed. pic.twitter.com/f31J6QvMf9 — Bob Elliott (@BobEUnlimited) December 27, 2022 He argued that these types of scenarios happen more often than most investors think they do. “Yet largely no investors hold reasonable allocations to gold. The market action this year and this month are a good reminder of the diversifying value of gold in a portfolio,” Elliott said. Gold prices have been on an upward path since late October. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) has gained 3.18% in the last one month while the iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSE:FXI) has risen over 4% in the period. Replying to a Twitter user on gold’s price movement during the 2008 financial crisis, Elliott said that developed central banks’ sales of gold in the late 90s and early 2000s put a big structural weight on the yellow metal for a while. It ended in 2007 and the price rose after it stopped, he said. Read Next: Cathie Wood Loads Up Another $2M In Tesla While Elon Musk Urges Employees To Look Beyond Stock Plunge"
2023-01-03,Is 2023 The Year Of The Gold Bull Market? A Look At The Bullion On Larger Time Frames,"The price of spot gold reached $1,850.15 per troy ounce on Tuesday –the highest the commodity has traded since June 17, 2022. Amid an increased risk of a recession in 2023 and central banks purchasing gold bullion, several analysts have called for even higher prices this year, according to CNBC. Managing director and chief investment officer at Swiss Asia Capital, Juerg Kiener, said on CNBC’s “Street Signs Asia” that he sees gold appreciating drastically this year. Comparing the bear markets of 2001 and 2008 with the present conditions, Kiener sees similarities. “In 2001, the market didn’t just move 20 or 30%, it moved a lot, the same in 2008 when we had actually a smaller sell-off in the market and the stimulus coming back in, and gold went from $600 to $1,800 in no time, so I think we have a very good chance that we see a major move,” Kiener said. “It is not going to be just 10 or 20%, I think I’m looking at a move which will really make new highs,” he added. Head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, Ole Hanson, also sees the current economic conditions as a bullish factor for the price of gold this year. “In general, we are looking for a price friendly 2023 supported by recession and stock market valuation risks — an eventual peak in central bank rates combined with the prospect of a weaker dollar and inflation not returning to the expected sub-3% level by year-end — all adding support,” he said, according to CNBC. While the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) posted a return of just 0.78% in 2022, the year ahead may provide more upside. From a technical standpoint, gold looks headed much higher over the coming weeks and months because the commodity has been trading in a solid uptrend on larger time frames since Oct. 31. Although pullbacks should be expected if gold continues to climb higher, the bullion has also confirmed a bull market by trading above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) since Dec. 20. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The Gold Chart: Gold is trading in a consistent uptrend on both the daily and weekly charts, but hasn’t yet confirmed an uptrend on the monthly chart. For an uptrend to confirm on the largest of the three timeframes, the commodity will eventually need to retrace and print a higher low above $1,614.92, although it looks unlikely to decrease that much at the present time. On Tuesday, gold pulled back from its high-of-day price (HOD) and was looking to print a possible shooting star candlestick on the daily chart. If the commodity closes the trading session with a long upper wick, it could indicate a further pullback is in the cards for Wednesday. If gold closes the trading session near the HOD, it will print a bullish Marubozu candlestick, which could indicate another rally is on the horizon. The commodity could also print an inside bar to consolidate Tuesday’s sharp rise. On the daily, weekly and monthly charts, gold broke up from a descending channel on Nov. 8, which suggested a long-term reversal to the upside was likely. If the commodity continues to trade above the 200-day SMA on the daily chart for a few more weeks, the 50-day SMA will cross above the 200-day, which would indicate a long-term bull market is in the cards, possibly for much of 2023. Gold has resistance above at $1,850 and $1,877.15 and support below at $1,831.12 and $1,794.63.

2023-01-03,Gold Hits 6-Month High Ahead Of Fed Minutes Release — Why Experts See A Bright 2023 For Bullion,"Ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve's December policy meeting minutes on Wednesday, gold prices hit a six-month high, albeit in thin trading. Spot gold was trading higher by 0.98% at $1,841.55 per ounce at the time of writing. The dollar index fell 0.1%, making greenback-priced bullion more attractive for overseas buyers, reported Reuters. Also Read: How To Invest In Startups Gold is one of the best hedges against inflation and economic uncertainties, but in a higher interest rate environment, the opportunity cost of holding gold is high as the commodity does not yield interest. The yellow metal registered a pretty flat performance in 2022. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) posted a return of just 0.78% in the last year while the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) returned 0.96%. Expert Take: However, experts have been positive on gold this year. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of Rich Dad, Poor Dad tweeted his forecasts for the yellow metal and silver for 2023. “I became a gold bug in 1972. I was a Marine pilot in Vietnam flying behind enemy lines hoping to buy gold at a discount because the mine was in enemy hands. Found out the price of gold is the same all over the world. I predict silver going to $75 and gold to $3,800 in 2023,” he said. Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, said in a note the dollar and yield movements would be a key focus for the gold market, according to the Reuters report. “The de-dollarization seen by several central banks last year, when a record amount of gold was bought, look set to continue, thereby providing a soft floor under the market,” Hansen said.

2023-01-04,Here's How Tesla Short Seller Stanphyl Capital's Fund Performed In 2022 As EV Maker's Stock Tumbled,"After another brutal year in 2021, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) short sellers had their best year ever in 2022 as a combination of a difficult macroeconomic environment and some questionable decisions by Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent Tesla's stock price down 65% on the year. Spiegel’s Bearish Take: One of Tesla’s most vocal short sellers has been Stanphyl Capital Partners Managing Member & Portfolio Manager Mark Spiegel. In Stanphyl’s December letter to investors, Spiegel discussed his bearish take on Tesla and revealed just how much his Tesla short position impacted Stanphyl’s full-year returns in 2022. Related Link: Is Elon Musk Really Done Selling Tesla Stock? He Has Said So 4 Times In The Past Year In the letter, Spiegel said he still considers Tesla grossly overvalued and is maintaining short positions in both Tesla and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) heading into 2023. Spiegel also admitted he pulled the plug too early when he exited his short position in the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) earlier in 2022. “Tesla’s inevitable meltdown (alright, so I was a mere eight years too early!) was a big contributor to this year’s performance (and we remain short it, as I believe it has another 90% to go), as were our other short positions in the S&P 500 (via SPY) and, early in the year, the garbage-stock ETF ARKK (which I covered way too early, leaving lots of additional profit on the table),” Spiegel said. While his short position in Tesla paid off big in 2022, Cathie Wood’s ARKK ETF also finished the year down 67%. Related Link: Huge Rebound For Tesla? Lucid Bankruptcy? Auto Analyst's 10 Bold Predictions For 2023 Overall 2022 Performance: Despite a bearish outlook for the S&P 500 heading into 2023, Stanphyl maintains long positions in several value stocks, including automakers Volkswagen A G Unsponsored ADR (OTC:VWAPY), Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). “GM is doing all the right things in electric cars, software and autonomous driving (via its Cruise ownership); in fact, Cruise is already running a fleet of fully autonomous cars in multiple U.S. cities—you can see many videos of this on its YouTube channel,” Spiegel said. Spiegel also said Stanphyl has a long position in the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) as a hedge against inflation. Thanks in large part to the huge payoff on the Tesla short position, Stanphyl reported a 2022 full-year return of 75.5%, a gain that looks even more impressive compared to the S&P 500's nearly 20% decline on the year. Heading into 2023, Spiegel joked that his chances of repeating such an impressive performance this year are roughly equal to the chance of Elon Musk offering me a board seat at Tesla. Benzinga’s Take: Spiegel has taken a lot of criticism over the years for his bearish take on Tesla, which had certainly been costly prior to 2022. However, Stanphyl also reported a 25.9% gain in 2021 even with Tesla shares up 49.7% on the year, highlighting Spiegel's ability to effectively manage risk in his short positions as well.

2023-01-30,"South African Gold Mining Stock AngloGold Ashanti Gets Upgraded, Gold Fields Downgraded","The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 15.8% since Oct. 1, and gold prices are approaching $2,000 per ounce for the first time since April 2022. On Monday, one gold miner analyst adjusted his coverage of South African gold miners and said investors should tread carefully in the region. The Analyst: Bank of America analyst Cameron Needham has issued the following ratings changes: Upgraded AngloGold Ashanti Limited (NYSE:AU) from Neutral to Buy with a price target of $24. Downgraded Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) from Buy to Neutral with a price target of $12.20. Related Link: Good As Gold: Investors Haven't Given Up On The Traditional Safe Haven The Thesis: As a whole, Needham said he is bullish on the outlook for gold but prefers stocks that have either a proven track record of value creation or potential for value creation via restructuring or operational improvements. Among the South African miners, Needham says AngloGold fits the bill. ANG’s restructuring programme is underway and as such, we view the risk-reward as somewhat skewed towards the upside as operational improvements are delivered, Needham said. Related Link: If You Invested $1,000 In The GLD Gold ETF At Its Pandemic Low, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Needham says the termination of Gold Field's merger deal with Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE:AUY) and the resignation of its CEO create an uncertainty overhang for the stock. He also reiterated an Underperform rating for Harmony Gold Mining Co. (NYSE:HMY) with a $2.20 price target, citing how the company's poor track record with facilities creates a safety risk for investors. Benzinga's Take: Gold has historically had a very low correlation with stock prices, making it a great way to protect your portfolio from a stock market sell-off. While gold does not generate any cash flow or yield directly, it may still be the best option in today's market for investors looking for an effective inflation hedge that can hold up amid a broad stock market sell-off."

2023-02-13,'Rich Dad Poor Dad' Author Warns 'Giant Crash Coming' In US Markets: Only Bitcoin Or 'God's Money' Can Save You Now,"Economic trajectory has become hard to predict, given the uncertainty surrounding the sum of the parts that make up the economy. “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki apparently is in the pessimistic camp, going by his recent comments. What Happened: “Giant crash is coming. Depression possible,” Kiyosaki tweeted late on Sunday. His comments come against the backdrop of the setback seen in the past week after the financial markets were cruising along nicely this year. See Also: Best Commodity ETFs Inflation fears and some mixed earnings reports put brakes on the year’s market rally in the week ended Feb. 10. Depression is a more severe form of recession, which, in turn, is defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. The best-selling author’s comments may be a little farfetched, going by the consensus view about the near-term economic trajectory. Despite the multiple overhangs, the U.S. economy is still holding up. The job market has been particularly vibrant. The January non-farm payrolls report showed that the U.S. economy added 517,000 jobs and the jobless rate was at a 53-year low of 3.4%. That said, inflation continues to be a pushback. As pricing pressure remains at levels that are far from encouraging, the Federal Reserve under Jerome Powell is not able to take its foot off the pedal. Therefore, the prospect is bigger hikes for longer is staring at the economy. Most economists vouch for some form of recession in the year’s second half amid the rollback of the Fed’s expansionary policy. Participants at a recent panel discussion organized by the University of Chicago Booth School Of Business suggested that there would be a mild recession toward the end of the year, given the Fed has enough tools in its hands to keep the situation from getting out of control. Shuns Dollar, Throws Weight Behind 3 Assets: Amid this gloomy backdrop, Kiyosaki continued to back gold, silver and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC). Giving his rationale, he said, faith in the U.S. dollar, which he called “fake money” will be destroyed. Gold and silver are precious metals denominated in the U.S. dollar and they share an inverse relationship with the dollar. The dollar losing its appeal would mean people favoring decentralized alternatives such as Bitcoin. Kiyosaki called gold and silver “God’s money” and Bitcoin the people’s dollar. By 2025, he expects gold to climb to $5,000, silver to $500 and Bitcoin to $500,000. Spot gold is currently trading at $1,858.61 per ounce, spot silver at $21.86 per ounce and Bitcoin at $21,864.35. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) ended Friday's session up 0.19% at $173.36, the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) gained 0.30% to $20.24, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Gold technical analysis: Bull flag pattern in place Gold price daily timeframe – Chart: TradingView Gold prices broke through a multi-resistance zone this week, which included the 50-day moving average, the psychological $1,900/oz level, and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the high-to-low range from 2022. After the breakout of the flag channel, we can observe the emergence of a bullish flag pattern on the price chart, which may presage an extension of the current rally. The next resistance level is between 1,975 and 1,980, which corresponds to the 2023 price high as well as the 78.6% Fibonacci level. Breaking through this barrier will boost the bull's momentum and improve the chances of an assault on the psychological 2,000 mark. 3 Gold ETFs to Watch: GLD, GDX, GDXJ SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and Junior Gold Miners VanEck Vectors ETF (NYSE:GDX) GDXJ are three ETFs to watch for investors looking to profit on gold's rally. 1) GLD SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) is an exchange-traded fund managed by World Gold Trust Services, LLC that invests in gold bullions and is linked to physical gold performance. As a result, its price moves in lockstep with the commodity, and it does not pay dividends. GLD saw its highest weekly net inflow in almost a year in the week ended March 16, totalling $709.5 million. GLD price chart and weekly ETF flows – Chart: Koyfin 2) GDX The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in the stocks of companies in the gold mining industry. It tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index's performance through a complete replication. Dividends are paid once a year, and the current dividend yield is 1.6%. GDX's major holdings include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:EAM). In the week ending March 16, GDX received $52 million in weekly net inflows, after around $240 million in outflows the previous week. GDX price chart and weekly ETF flows – Chart: Koyfin 3) GDXJ The VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE:GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in stocks of companies involved in the gold mining industry. Differently from GDX, the majority of these companies are still in the development and exploratory phases and are seeking for land with a high potential for significant mineral deposits. Junior gold miners are thus more volatile than already productive gold miners, which is why GDXJ has a greater volatility than GDX. GDXJ's top holdings include Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC), Yamana Gold Inc. (NYSE:AUY), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI), and Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE:PAAS). The last week's ETF flow data is missing, but GDXJ had $24 million in outflows in the week ending March 9.

2023-03-22,Here's A Gold Rally Sympathy Play With 32% Upside Potential: Analyst,"Gold prices have been on a rollercoaster ride since last week, with investors selling off their gold holdings in the wake of the abating fears over the U.S. banking crisis. Prices of the precious metal soared past the $2,000 level earlier this week, but fell 1.92% to $1,944 on Tuesday. Despite market turbulence, analyst Gianni Di Poce believes that there is still upside potential for gold-exposed stocks, particularly Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD). Check out Benzinga's precious metals page. The GOLD Analyst: Di Poce, in his weekly “Benzinga Pro Insider Report,” said he is bullish on Barrick Gold as long as shares stay above the $16 level, and set a price target of between $24 and $26 on the stock. Di Poce noted that Barrick brought in $11.01 billion in revenue in 2022, along with $432 million in earnings. While the valuation metrics for the company are mixed, with a high P/E of 72.50 but a more moderate Price-to-Sales of 2.79 and an EV to EBITDA of 7.77, the technical analysis for the stock is bullish. Barrick recently broke out from a falling wedge formation and is now retesting former-resistance-turned-support, Di Poce said, creating a higher-low and implying higher prices ahead. Barrick is focused on operating Tier One mining assets, with the ability to produce over 500,000 ounces of gold per year. If gold prices rally, it could translate to a significant increase in forward revenue. The company also has at least 10 years of productive life remaining in its current mines. That's a crucial factor to consider when looking at mining companies since they extract a finite natural resource. Barrick is expected to produce roughly 6.5 million ounces of gold and copper alloy equivalents into 2032. It has also significantly cleaned up its balance sheet in recent years by paying down debt and boosting its cash flow, the analyst noted. Free quarterly cash flow is now $1.24 billion, and the company is keen on returning capital to its shareholders with a payout ratio of around 229%. While the gold market may be turbulent at present, Di Poce’s analysis suggests that Barrick could be a solid investment choice for those seeking exposure to the precious metal.

2023-03-23,"Goldman Sachs Raises Gold Price Target To An All-Time High Of $2,050 Amid Recession Fears","In a report published Wednesday, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) commodities analysts Sabine Schels and Jeffrey Currie boosted their gold price prediction to $2,050/oz for the next year, citing high fear and growing recession risks. Gold has risen by more than $150/toz in the last two weeks as a result of stress on the financial system. Fear is the key medium to short-term driver for gold, even more than real rates, according to the experts. Gold is a safe haven asset during times of rising currency debasement risks, sovereign balance sheet risks, geopolitical risk and other market tail risks. The current catalysts making the bullish case for the precious metal are the banking and funding stress and the rising probabilities of a U.S. recession next year. Goldman anticipates gold ETF investment to grow in parallel with increasing recession risk, a pattern that may have begun last week with strong inflows into gold-backed ETFs.

The world's biggest asset manager has recently placed an overweight on inflation-linked bonds and reiterated an underweight on developed market stocks as damage looms. “With all of the worrisome headlines that markets have had to navigate these past couple of weeks, it's remarkable that indexes have eked out gains and remain at odds with the message from the Treasury market, particularly the yield curve inversions,” said LPL Financial Chief Global Strategist Quincy Crosby. “Markets tend to ‘get the news first,’ and it could very well be that the equity market is actually in agreement with the Treasury market and the futures market, that the Fed is nearly finished,” he added.

The analyst said the pandemic allowed companies to enjoy debt on extremely favorable terms. As this debt matures over the next few years, companies will likely have to refinance at potentially materially higher rates, he said. Higher interest expense, the analyst said, might drag down corporate earnings and put pressure on market prices. If the jobless claims data and the consumer price consumption expenditure index come in stronger than expected, “the market may need to recheck expectations for a much less aggressive Fed,” Berkowitz said. “We know that the FOMC is watching these closely as well.” Major US Equity ETFs: As of midday trading on Tuesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 1.1% higher to $400.08, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was 0.8% up to $326.24 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) rose 1.6% to 311.84, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-03-31,Peter Schiff Says Investors Running Out Of Time To Buy Gold Below $2K Per Ounce: 'Don't Get Left Behind',"Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, believes investors may be running out of time to buy gold below the $2,000 per ounce price, as the yellow metal has embarked on an upward path in the wake of sticky inflation. What Happened: Time is running out to buy #gold for less than $2K per ounce. Once gold breaks above $2.1K it’s off to the races. Don’t get left behind. The choice between fighting #inflation and mitigating a financial crisis was always inevitable, as was the Fed’s choice, Schiff said in his tweet. Also Read: Gold IRA Kit A weaker dollar and falling bond yields drove demand for the precious metal as it rose about 1% on Thursday. Spot gold was last trading close to the $1,978-per ounce level during Asian trading hours. Last week, it touched the $2,000-per ounce level. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have gained over 8% in last one month. Expert Take: Bart Melek, head of commodity strategies at TD Securities, told Reuters that much of this rally continues to be a short covering rally. “The catalyst here is the continued expectations that rates in the U.S. will top out,” Melek said. Last week, multiple analysts indicated gold prices have more potential to rise and possibly break all-time highs. Market participants are now eyeing the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which is the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of underlying price pressures. “Anything below expectations on the core (PCE) would imply that there is less need or requirement for tight monetary policy from the Federal Reserve,” Melek told Reuters.

2023-04-04,Peter Schiff Believes Inflation-Hedging Assets Like Gold Set For A Breakout — But What About Bitcoin?,"Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, believes assets used to hedge against inflation like gold are set to breakout soon while dollar and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) are on the verge of a breakdown. What Happened: I think risk assets will soon breakdown hard, led lower by #Bitcoin. #Inflation hedges are about to breakout, lead higher by precious metals miners. As I titled my last podcast, #gold stocks are the new tech #stocks. Either prepare for this new reality or suffer the consequences, he said in a tweet. Also Read: How To Invest In Startups Indeed, spot gold has risen from the lows of $1,622 levels seen in October 2022 to trade close to the $2,000 per ounce levels in recent days. It was last seen trading at $1,980 per ounce during Asian trading. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have gained over 7% in last one month. Schiff is of the view that investors have been far too complacent and said they have no appreciation of the magnitude of the problem created by the Federal Reserve. We could be days away from a major breakdown in the U.S. dollar and breakout in #gold. Perhaps this will finally be the wake-up call investors need, he said in his tweet. Inflation Problem: The recent production cut announcement by OPEC+ has become the latest headache for the central bank as it tries to rein-in inflation while simultaneously attempting to resolve the banking crisis. According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the market is considering close to 55% probability of a 25 basis points rate hike in the next FOMC meet. Schiff expects long term interest rates to rise at a time when inflation strengthens and economy weakens and says that falling dollar and rising oil and gold prices are bad signs. Surging #oil prices is bad news for tech #stocks as it highlights that the #inflation problem will only get worse. The trend of lower YoY #CPI numbers is over. Future increases will be trending higher from here. That limits the #Fed’s ability to cut rates, even as QE accelerates, he tweeted.

2023-04-04,"Recession Playbook In Action: Cooling Labor Market Triggers Rally In Treasuries, Gold; Stocks Decline","Recent economic data has prompted investors to hedge against the rising likelihood of a recession. In February 2023, there were 9.9 million job openings, which was the lowest level since May 2021 and below market estimates of 10.4 million, suggesting that the labor market may have begun to weaken. Still, in February, new orders for U.S. manufactured goods fell for the second consecutive month by 0.7% compared to the previous month, following a revised 2.1% loss in January and falling short of market estimates of a 0.5% loss. This comes after the ISM Manufacturing PMI for March was 46.3, down 1.4 points from the previous month and below estimates of 47.5. Benzinga's take: The number of available vacancies is an important indicator that the Federal Reserve monitors in connection to the number of unemployed people in order to measure labor market tightness. A tight labor market might contribute to wage inflation. According to the most recent data on job openings, there are presently 1.65 jobs available for every jobless person in the United States, still indicating a tight labor market, but lower than the ratio of almost two seen in 2022. This figure will need to be revised on Friday, when we receive statistics from nonfarm payrolls and the March unemployment rate. Market Reactions: The Recession Playbook Market reactions in Tuesday's session following the release of daily economic data indicate that investors are increasingly pricing in the possibility of an economic downturn. Investors have flocked to asset safe havens, with treasuries appreciating in the face of falling yields, and gold rallying against a plunging U.S. dollar.

2023-04-04,3 Signs A Recession Is Coming: Just 1 Is Left Before Bank Of America Sounds The Alarm,"Bank of America published a playbook Tuesday on how to spot recessionary bear markets and which assets perform best during downturns. The BofA research team named the following three major signs predicting a market crisis by analyzing the previous 150 recession events since 1800 and 16 S&P 500 bear markets during economic downturns: 1) Steepening of the Treasury yield curve. 2) Stringent lending conditions by banks. 3) Fed forced to cut interest rates. Only the third requirement has yet to occur. Contrary to popular belief, recessionary bear markets generally cause a 25% further decline in stocks following the Fed's first rate cut, according to BofA. Bank of America Equity & Quant Strategist Savita Subramanian targets 4,000 on the S&P 500, which is tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSE:SPY). The stock market might go as low as 3,000 due to dangers such as a recession, more earnings cuts and weakening cyclical indicators, the analyst said. Read next: Recession Playbook In Action: Cooling Labor Market Triggers Rally In Treasuries, Gold; Stocks Decline Yield Curve Inversions Anticipates Recession The three-month Treasury bill yield is 135 basis points above the yield on a 10-year Treasury note, according to BofA — the most inverted spread since 1981. Eight of 10 such yield curve inversions came before recessionary bear markets going back to 1921, the analysts said. Markets typically trough 17 months after the curve starts to steepen, as the 2yr/10yr has done. Stocks are defying credit-crunch fears and have not yet been priced for a recession, according to BofA. Typically, the S&P 500 price/earnings ratio declines by 6.3, but earnings have yet to fall to historical norms, implying a further 20% downside risk in stocks. BofA is pessimistic on the technology sector on the basis of its valuations being among the most expensive. The research team highlighted that five companies have averaged 35% returns this year, accounting for 21% of the S&P 500 and 44% of the Nasdaq 100, while the remainder of the market has averaged low single digits. Investors have another chance of profiting from inflated bonds and stocks, according to BofA. Technicals Signal Changing Mood: Paul Ciana, head of technical strategy at BofA, said the breadth of market technicals is heading toward more risk aversion in the second quarter of the year, which should favor bonds over stocks. “If the S&P 500 ever goes below the 200-week average, which today has risen to approximately 3,750, then the risk of a secular decline increases like those seen in the 1970s inflationary cycles,” the analyst said. The chart below demonstrates that every time the S&P 500 fell below its 200-day moving average, the bear market intensified. Investing During A Recession: The BofA US Regime Indicator has now shifted toward Downturn mode. Defensive stocks such as staples, small caps, value, corporate bonds and gold tend to perform better during downturns and recovery periods, the analyst firm said. BofA likes the iShares U.S. Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:IYK), the Pacer US Small Cap Cash Cows 100 ETF (NYSE:CALF), the Vanguard Value ETF (NYSE:VTV), the iShares Fallen Angels USD Bond ETF (NYSE:FALN) and SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). BofA's favorite trade for the next phase of this bear market is long staples (IYK)/short First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (NASDAQ:QTEC). Staples remain undercapitalized and may benefit from trade-down effects this year as customers look for lower-cost options, BofA said. Technology is unreasonably expensive, too concentrated, and has outperformed only under two downturn regimes, the analysts said: the dot-com bubble and Covid.

2023-04-05,"Gold Eyes Record High On Safe-Haven Status, Weak Dollar, Hopes Of Softening Fed: Peter Schiff Sees 'Spectacular' Rally","Gold continued its upward momentum over the $2,000 per ounce level during Tuesday morning Asian trade supported by a decline in the dollar and rising expectations that the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary policy may be nearing its end. Spot gold was trading at $2,022 per ounce at the time of writing. The commodity has risen from the lows of $1,622 levels seen in October 2022 and has been trading close to the $2,000 per ounce level in recent days. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have gained over 9% in the last month. Also Read: Gold IRA Kit It is noteworthy that gold-linked stocks like AngloGold Ashanti Limited (NYSE:AU), SSR Mining Inc (NASDAQ:SSRM) and Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) have made gains ranging from over 15% to 46% in the last month. On the economy front, U.S. job openings in February declined to the lowest level in about two years while factory orders dropped for a second straight month indicating the economy may be weakening. This is likely to have raised investor expectations about Fed's rate hikes nearing their end in the foreseeable future. A weakening dollar is also helping push the yellow metal higher, which could test its record high of $2,075.47 seen in August 2020. Expert Take: David Lennox, an analyst at Sydney-based Fat Prophets told Bloomberg that gold price is primarily now being driven by concerns about the dollar. Bullion is enjoying a safe haven premium in the wake of financial fears including the recent banking crisis and geopolitical tensions, he added. Experts like Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, have been sounding out the likelihood of gold prices witnessing a surge. Today the #gold price closed at a new 52-week high. Yet senior miners still need to rise by over 20% and juniors by over 25% to hit new 52-week highs. The divergence is due to negative sentiment. Investors still don’t believe the rally is real. It’s real and will be spectacular, he tweeted. Read Next: Federal Reserve’s Loretta Mester Expects Likelihood Of More Rate Hikes — Here’s Why"
2023-04-05,Bullion's Wall Street Boom: Technicals Suggest All-Time Highs Might Be Hit Soon,"Gold is having another strong week of gains, breaching the important psychological barrier of $2,000/oz and now nearing its August 2020 record high of $2,075/oz. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) is barely 3% away from its all-time high of $195. A series of bullish catalysts has fueled the precious metal's recent climb. On the macro front, gold has received substantial support from both China's reopening, since Chinese consumers are the world's largest buyers of the precious metal, and the U.S. banking crisis. Historically, the yellow metal has done exceptionally well during times of financial crisis and economic uncertainty. The gold rally is also being assisted by rising predictions of a Fed policy shift and a drop in U.S. Treasury yields, which represent a cost opportunity of investing in a non-yielding asset like gold. Read next: Gold Eyes Record High On Safe-Haven Status, Weak Dollar, Hopes Of Softening Fed: Peter Schiff Sees 'Spectacular' Rally BofA and Goldman Are Bullish On Gold On top of that, several Wall Street analysts issued bullish calls on gold and raised their price forecasts. Goldman Sachs boosted its 12-month gold price target to $2050/toz, citing the fear and wealth effects. Bank of America increased its 4Q23 gold price projection to $2,200/oz, on the back of the anticipated ending of the Fed hiking cycle, which could attract more investors to the market. Read also: Goldman Sachs Raises Gold Price Target To An All-Time High Of $2,050 Amid Recession Fears Gold Technical Analysis: It's Hard To Halt The Bullish Wave Momentum Gold has established a bullish flag pattern, which began with the November-January rally, followed by a pullback in February-March, and is currently continuing with the extension that began in mid-March. If the current second leg of the rally mirrors the first, which happened between November and January, gold might reach $2,070/oz, where it will test all-time highs. Momentum indicators continue to support this potential gold move toward the ATH. Since mid-March, the 14-day RSI has been far above 50, showing that bulls have full control of the short-term trend. The short-term moving averages have lately given a so-called golden cross, with the 21-dma crossing above the 50-dma, signaling a possible bullish indication.

Corporate earnings are likely to tumble in the next months, according to the BofA Global EPS Growth Model, with EPS falling by 16% year-on-year by August. The latest March ISM Manufacturing PMI was 46.3, the lowest since May 2020, and the non-manufacturing ISM was 51.2, the fourth lowest level since the Great Recession, the BofA strategist said. In the previous 70 years, a recession happened 11 out of 12 occasions when the manufacturing ISM fell below 45, according to BofA. Weakening manufacturing ISM indicates the U.S. labor market will shrink in the next months. In recent quarters, U.S. banks have also tightened lending rules to small businesses. A credit bottleneck is projected to worsen and is strongly linked to small business layoffs.

2023-04-11,Bracing For Inflation: Did March CPI Spike? Spotlight On 5 Key ETFs To Navigate The Market,"The publication of the March U.S. inflation rate statistics by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday, April 12, is the most anticipated economic event of the week, as investors anxiously await the outcome. The consensus from Wall Street economists expects annual CPI inflation to fall from 6% in February to 5.2% in March. The overall CPI index is projected to rise 0.2% month on month, somewhat less than the 0.4% increase reported the previous month. However, the underlying measure of inflation, known as core inflation, which excludes energy and food, is predicted to stay relatively sticky, rising 0.4% month on month to 5.6% year-over-year. The core CPI inflation rate was 5.5% in February. Read more: Inflation Threat Looms As Economy Shows Slowing Signs: Benzinga's Main Street Monitor Inflation Previews From Wall Street Economists A number of sell-side banks have recently released their March CPI forecasts: Bank of America forecasts headline inflation to rise by 0.4% monthly. As a result, the annual reading will decline from 6% to 5.3%. Core inflation, and core services, however, are expected to remain sticky-high, with monthly core CPI up 0.4% to 5.6%, marginally higher than the prior 5.5%. According to BofA economists, much of this stickiness stems from elevated rent and owners' equivalent rent inflation. Goldman Sachs is also broadly in line with the analysts' consensus. Core CPI is expected to rise 0.4% month-on-month to 5.6%, owing to another hot shelter reading. Headline CPI is seen 0.1% higher on the month, to 5.1%. Citigroup highlighted more upside risks for the March inflation reading, citing continued strength in various non-shelter services. Citi expects core CPI to edge up 0.5% on the month, or 5.7% year-on-year, slightly above consensus. BNP Paribas also expects inflation to remain high in March, with the core CPI printing 5.7% year-on-year and the headline CPI 5.2% year-on-year. However, the positive news would likely come from a peak in the core services component. 5 ETFs That Are Likely to See Volatile Price Action Following the CPI Release Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ): Tech stocks are particularly sensitive to changes in Fed rate expectations. A higher-than-expected CPI would likely push the Nasdaq 100 index lower, and vice versa, as investors reprice the rate path. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY): Also for the broader S&P 500 index, higher-than-expected inflation represents a headwind. iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT): This ETF, tracking the performance of U.S. Treasury notes with maturities higher than 20 years, will likely face some downside pressure if the CPI beats expectations in March. SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD): Gold prices would likely see an increasing volatility if Treasury yields move abruptly following the CPI release. iShares Trust Silver (NYSE:SLV): Also, silver is strongly and inversely linked to long-term Treasury yields, and therefore a stronger inflation surprise will likely hit the metal.

2023-04-11,S&P 500 Holds Steady While Tech Slides As Traders Await Key Inflation Print: Fed's Williams Says Another Hike Is 'Reasonable',"The market is shifting gears ahead of Wednesday's key inflation report and in preparation for the start of the earnings season. The Nasdaq 100 index of technology stocks fell, despite crypto-related startups rallying, as Bitcoin extended gains beyond $30,000. Large-cap companies fared relatively better. Treasury yields rose slightly. Investors assigned a 70% likelihood of a Fed rate hike next month. New York Federal Reserve President John Williams, who spoke Monday after the market close, said that one more rate hike is a reasonable starting place and added there is no evidence yet of a tightening of credit conditions. Cues From Tuesday’s Trading: The S&P 500 index was flat on the day, holding at about 4,100 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked higher by 0.4%, driven by gains in the industrials and health-care sectors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index slipped 0.6%, pulled down by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), both of which fell more than 2%. U.S. Indices' Performance On Monday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite -0.4% 12,037.65 S&P 500 Index +0.08% 4,113.32 Dow Industrials +0.38% 33,722.07 Analyst Color: Despite job growth showing some softness, the unemployment rate remains at 50-year lows, providing the Federal Reserve with plenty of room to “stay higher for longer” within their stated goals, said fund manager Louis Navellier. Therefore, investors trying to time the market for a major rally from rate cuts in 2023 would probably be disappointed, he said. “A relief rally, however, when the Fed announces a pause in further cuts remains quite likely, though maybe short-lived, if unemployment does, in fact, start to rise from 3.5% to 4.5%,” he added. If results and forecasts from companies confirm that earnings contraction has bottomed in the first quarter, what the Fed does matters less, Navellier said. “Companies which retain pricing power and are addressing their cost structure will outperform indexes even if the Fed has to go even higher than expected to move closer to their objectives.” Tuesday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Monday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) edged 0.1% higher to $410.18, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.4% to $337.17 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) eased 0.6% to $316.05 according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-12,"Nasdaq, S&P 500 Price Action Reveals Anxiety As Traders Assess Inflation Data, Await Fed Minutes","The stock market is jittery after early excitement at the release of March inflation data faded throughout Wednesday's session, as investors worry the future of the Federal Reserve's monetary policies, with the minutes of the most recent FOMC meeting due Wednesday afternoon. The U.S. inflation rate slowed more than expected to 5% year-on-year in March, marking the lowest print since May 2021. Core inflation remained hot, ticking up from 5.5% in February to 5.6%, matching predictions. The Fed's Tom Barkin said inflation has peaked but the Fed still have a ways to go to get it under control. Investors presently estimate a 75% chance of another Fed interest rate rise in May, but expect this will be the final lift, with a first rate cut factored in as early as July. Cues From Wednesday's Trading: Stocks were volatile on Wednesday. Following the inflation report, major U.S. market indices soared before reversing the majority of gains in noon trade. The S&P 500 index was 0.2% higher on the day, but 0.8% lower than intraday highs. The Nasdaq 100 was flat, shedding 1.2% from intraday highs.

BofA said March CPI reading puts the Fed on pace to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at its May meeting. Despite the March improvement, the Fed believes that inflation is still far too high. Gapen expects the Fed to deliver on its dot-plot projection by hiking rates to 5%-5.25% as long as banking sector stress stays mild.

2023-04-13,Peter Schiff Says Real Reason Gold Prices Are Rising Is Because 'High Inflation Is Here To Stay',"Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, says the real reason gold prices are rising is because of the belief that inflation will continue to stay higher.

Schiff also believes when the Fed actually ends up cutting rate, the markets are likely to witness a sell-off leading to fund flows into the yellow metal.

2023-04-13,"US Stocks Rally On Cooling Price Pressures, Softening Job Market: Investors Eye Fed Hike Cycle's Conclusion","A lower-than-expected producer inflation and higher-than-expected unemployment claims boosted risk appetite on Thursday, with all major U.S. equity indices posting sharp gains as investors increased speculations about the end of the rate hike cycle after the Fed's May meeting. Interest-rate sensitive mega caps, such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have gained more than 2% on the day. A weaker greenback, with EUR/USD hitting fresh yearly highs, also supported stock advances. Cues From Thursday's Trading: Producer price inflation (PPI) decreased by 0.5% in March, falling short of forecasts for a flat monthly reading, while weekly unemployment claims surged by 11,000 to 239,000, above expectations. The two findings signal that a cooling trend in pricing pressures and the labor market is already underway. Stocks rallied across the board as investors wagered the Federal Reserve will stop raising in June and deliver the first reduction as early as July, according to latest CME Group FedWatch tool. The S&P 500 index gained 0.7%, returning above 4,100 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average grew 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed, gaining 1.4%.

He noted the two-year Treasury yield is trading about 83 basis points lower than the midpoint of the fed funds rate. If the Fed is done with raising rates sooner, it could mean the central bank will tolerate further easing of financial conditions, Lee said. He thinks this is particularly likely if the markets worry about credit tightening as commercial real estate and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other commercial lending markets show stress. “We believe bears remain trapped and April is going to be a generally strong month (based upon “rule of first five days”),” the analyst said. He also raised the specter of April panning out to be a back-end-loaded month like March. “We would use any weakness from a post-March CPI sell-off to add to equity exposure,” Lee said.

2023-04-18,"'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' Author Highlights Experts' Contrarian Views On Gold: 'Opposing Logic Makes You Smarter'","‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad' author Robert Kiyosaki has put forward interesting and divergent arguments on gold by experts Steve Van Metre and David Hunter, while saying it is important to consider opposing views and figure out the logic that drives buyers and sellers. What Happened: Sell gold now, Van Metre said in his YouTube video, stating that there is a very rare tactical pattern forming in gold that indicates prices of the metal are about to plummet. Also Read: Gold IRA Kit On the other hand, David Hunter told Small Caps that he predicts gold will hit the $20,000-mark while silver will touch $400-500 level by the end of the decade. Steve Van Metre says Sell gold now. David Hunter says Buy gold now. Who do you believe? Ans: Both smart men. All markets are made of buyers and sellers. Your job is to find out logic behind seller and buyer. Opposing logic makes you smarter which is more valuable than $, Kiyosaki tweeted. Price Action: Kiyosaki's comments came at a time when gold reversed course from its rally to fall below the key $2,000-level, dragged by a stronger dollar and higher Treasury yields on Monday. Spot gold continued to nudge the $2,000-mark during Tuesday morning Asian trade, at the time of writing. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have gained close to 1% in last one month. Carlo Alberto De Casa, external analyst at Kinesis Money, told Reuters the $1,980-$2,000 range is a promising support zone for gold. Going forward, market participants will be eyeing comments by Federal Reserve officials this week for any clues regarding the central bank's policy path.

2023-04-18,"S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Erase Session Gains After Hawkish Fed Remarks: Investors Now Almost Fully Discount 25bp Hike In May","Tuesday's session was off to a good start for the U.S. stock market, extending gains from Monday's closing, until hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve officials came in. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he still expects hikes and did not rule out pushing the Fed funds rate in the 5.5%-5.75% range. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that he expects another rate rise in May, followed by a rate hold in June, stating that inflation remains too high. Investors now almost fully discount a 25-basis-point hike in May, according to the CME Group Fedwatch tool, and have also priced out a rate cut expected as early as July. Major U.S. companies reporting Tuesday, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT), ProLogis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), reported better-than-expected EPS last quarter, ahead of Netflix's results due after market close. Cues From Tuesday's Trading: Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 were flat on the day, erasing early morning gains after Fed hawkish remarks.

The S&P 500 is coming in hot to the first-quarter earnings season, having returned 5% over the past months, said Turnquist. This marked one of the biggest rallies into a reporting period since 2000, he added. Looking at precedents, the analyst noted that since 2000, there have been 27 other quarters when the S&P 500 rallied at least 3% four weeks before the start of earnings season. “These outlier returns historically point to continued upside momentum for the index after the kickoff of earnings season, albeit at a moderated pace,” he said. The average and median seven-week returns — marking the bulk of the earnings season, were 1.4% and 3.1%, respectively, the analyst said. He sees key upside resistance for the S&P 500 Index at 4,200. Tuesday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Tuesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was holding steady at $413.97, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) eased 0.1% to $339.35 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was unchanged at $318.88, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-20,US Stocks Remain Under Pressure On Rising Economic Fears: Tesla Sinks 10% On Its Worst Day In 2023,"Major U.S. equity indices traded in the red on Thursday, attempting a minor rebound around midday, as investors scrutinized earnings reports and the latest economic data. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell nearly 10% on the day as the electric car manufacturer announced further price cuts and recorded its lowest quarterly gross margin in two years. Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said the Fed needs to raise rates above 5% and maintain them there for a while, but also remarked that the rate-hike journey is nearing its conclusion. Cues From Thursday's Trading: All major equity indices traded lower for the day, with the S&P 500 index down 0.3%, the Nasdaq 100 down 0.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.2%. Small caps in the Russell 2000 index underperformed, down 0.4%. U.S. Indices' Performance On Thursday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq 100 -0.1% 13,058.23 S&P 500 Index -0.4% 4,138.16 Dow Industrials -0.2% 33,830.18 Analyst Color: The market has been trading largely in-line with long-term interest rates in 2023, and rates may determine the outcome for the major indexes in the first half of the year, Justin Zacks, vice president of strategy of Moomoo Technologies Inc., told Benzinga Thursday. While there have been individual earnings movers (such as Tesla) so far this season, the overall market has had little overall reaction to companies’ results, Zacks said. The Fed's next meeting in May could mark an inflection point, the Moomoo strategist said. If it is the last time the Fed hikes rates, the real question will be whether it will quickly reverse course or hold policy steady for a longer period, something market participants are currently split on, he said. Technically in 2023, the S&P 500 has broadly traded in a channel between 3,800 and 4,200. With the 10-year note down over 35 basis points this year, the S&P 500 is approaching that upper bound of 4,200. A break of either side of this channel may determine the market’s trajectory in the months to come. Quincy Crosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, said the dramatic short positioning in the market, based on the widely followed Commitment of Traders, is the most since 2011. Bulls believe this will provide a tremendous source of momentum at the right time when the S&P 500 makes its move decidedly higher, he said. “The market is clearly in waiting mode, with the shorts ready to move instantaneously with an abundance of liquidity; the kind contrarians love to see,” Crosby said. The analyst said the focus will be on corporate guidance this earnings season. “For the bulls, it is crucial to have more S&P 500 names cross their 200-day moving averages in order to convert the bears who cling to the long list of economic considerations, including the debt ceiling challenges.” Thursday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Thursday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.3% lower to $412.83, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) eased 0.2% to $338.40 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 0.2% lower to $318.07, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-21,S&P 500 Headed To Weekly Losses After Five Straight Wins As Investors Fear Higher Rates For Longer,"The stock rally that began in the middle of March appears to have stalled, with investors taking profits on the back of renewed rate concerns following upbeat economic data. The S&P US Manufacturing and Services PMIs came in above forecasts in April, indicating a resurgence of pricing pressures and pushing U.S. Treasury yields higher on Friday. The broad market S&P 500 Index traded flat in midday trading on Friday, and is set to conclude the first week in the red after five straight advances. Fed futures now almost fully discount a 25-basis-point hike in May. Investors assign a 70% likelihood for rates to stay unchanged at 5-5.25% in June. Bets for the first Fed rate cut to occur in September were further trimmed, with markets now assigning a less than 50% probability, according to the latest CME Group Fedwatch tool. Cues From Friday's Trading: Stocks traded in a tight range on Friday, as traders digested mixed earnings reports and macro data prints. Major equity indices opened lower and then attempted a rebound into noon trading. The S&P 500 Index was marginally weaker, down 0.07%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 eased 0.2% while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000 were flat on the day. U.S. Indices' Performance On Friday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq 100 -0.18% 12,984 S&P 500 Index -0.07% 4,128 Dow Industrials -0.01% 33,779 A recession now looks like a foregone conclusion, said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, citing the decline in the leading indicators index to the levels last seen in November 2020 when the economy was contending with the COVID-19 pandemic. “Historically, an economic contraction has closely followed a decline in the LEI of this magnitude,” the economist said. The head fake from last year’s two quarters of negative economic growth and the uncertainty from an aggressive Federal Reserve were likely culprits for pushing down the markets last year. The good news, however, is that Roach does not expect the markets to retest those lows despite the likelihood of a recession later this year. Friday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Friday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.05% lower at $411.7, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) weakened by 0.07% to $337.71 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 0.1% higher to $316.61, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-24,"'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' Author Says Even If Gold Drops To $1,000/Ounce, He'll Still Be A Buyer: 'Cash Is Trash'","‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad' author Robert Kiyosaki believes even if gold plunges to $1,000 per ounce, he would still be a buyer as the yellow metal, silver and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) are real money while cash is trash. What Happened: Kiyosaki's comments follow expert Steven Van Metre's remarks in his recent YouTube video where he stated gold prices are about to plummet. Also Read: Gold IRA Kit GOLD to CRASH. Steve Van Meter (sic) whom I respect predicts gold to crash to $1000. He states markets are tired of waiting for gold to go higher. If gold drops to $1000 I will buy more. I am an investor not a trader. To me, Gold, Silver, &Bitcoin are real money. To me Cash is trash, he tweeted. Last week, Kiyosaki cited contrarian arguments on gold by Van Metre and David Hunter, saying it is important to consider opposing views and figure out the logic that drives buyers and sellers. Price Action: Gold prices had declined sharply on Friday, dragged by hawkish comments by Federal Reserve officials that strengthened bets for at least one more interest rate hike. Two central bank officials on Thursday reiterated the need for more interest rate hikes to rein in inflation just as the Fed is set to enter a silent period from April 22 to May 4, ahead of its next monetary policy announcement. Bob Haberkorn, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, told Reuters last week while a rate hike will initially dull gold’s appeal, an eventual pause will push gold to its recent all-time highs. …the Fed has a breaking point where they can’t go anymore on rates without doing significant damage to the economy, he added. Spot gold was trading at $1,980 per ounce during Monday morning Asian trade after having breached the $2,000 per ounce mark last week. In recent times, many experts have been asserting that gold was ready for a surge beyond the $2,000 per ounce level. However, the yellow metal has been finding it difficult to convincingly breach and rally beyond the mark. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) closed about 1% lower on Friday.

The analyst noted that the recent run has left the S&P 500 Index at the top-end of the trading range following its emergence from the October low. “We believe the combination of declining earnings, weakening economic growth, a steadfast Federal Reserve, and a lack of broad participation suggests the equity market is poised to struggle in the weeks and months ahead,” Lynch said. “Considering full employment and solid cash levels, we suspect the equity market, as a discounting mechanism will begin to price in a 2024 recovery in the second half of this year.” Comerica’s 2023 year-end price target for the S&P 500 Index is 4,100-4,200.

2023-04-27,March PCE Price Index Preview: Here's Why Fed's Favorite Inflation Gauge Is A Key Market-Moving Event Before FOMC,"Market participants are eagerly awaiting for the March personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index report from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on Friday (April 28), before the market opens. With the next FOMC meeting in less than a week, what is regarded as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation will be considered a key signal for assessing market expectations about the Fed's impending policy moves. What To Know: The PCE price index grew 5% year on year in February 2023, down from 5.3% in January, and 0.3% month on month, down from 0.6% in January. The Core PCE price index, which measures inflation over a wide range of consumer expenditures excluding energy and food and is of particular relevance to the Fed, increased 4.6% annually and 0.3% monthly in February. The annual figure was marginally above expectations (4.5%), while the monthly one matched estimates. The market consensus is for the March core PCE price index to rise 0.3% month on month and 4.5% year on year. The Bureau of Economic Analysis' initial GDP estimate in the first quarter of 2023 delivered surprises in terms of both real growth and the price deflator. While real GDP growth was lower than projected (1.1% vs. 2.2%), the price index for gross domestic purchases accelerated in the quarter (3.8% compared to 3.6% prior and a consensus of 3.7%). The BEA also announced PCE prices grew at a 4.2% quarter-on-quarter annualized rate in the first quarter of 2023 after gaining 3.7% in the fourth quarter of 2022. The core PCE price index climbed 4.9% in the first quarter of 2023 after rising 4.4%. Both figures were higher than market expectations of 0.5% and 3.7%, respectively. In March, the U.S. consumer price index (CPI) inflation was 5% year-on-year, down from the 6% posted in February and below expectations of 5.2%. Core CPI inflation, instead, ticked up from 5.5% to 5.6% year-on-year. The following are predicted to be some of the most volatile ETFs in response to the March PCE figures: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (NYSE:DIA) iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF (NASDAQ:BND) SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP) Why It Is Important For Markets: March Core PCE inflation will almost certainly remain substantially over the Fed's 2% inflation target. Markets will be paying close attention to how far the March Core PCE figure deviates from consensus predictions. A core PCE print of less than 0.3% monthly or 4.5% annually will likely reinforce current market assumptions that the Fed's rate hike cycle will come to an end in May. This will be a relief for the markets, even though a lot of the Fed's expected shift in policy may have already been priced in. A core PCE reading greater than 0.3% monthly or 4.5% yearly will generate considerably more uncertainty on the rate front, possibly sparking some speculation on another Fed hike in June, and so creating additional headwinds for interest-rate sensitive assets such as tech and growth equities as well as bonds, while likely favoring the U.S. dollar. Markets have nearly fully priced in a 25-basis-point rate hike in May to 5%-5.25%, however, estimates for the June meeting are more open with a 66% chance that rates would remain unchanged in the aforesaid range and a 24% chance of another hike, according to CME Group Fedwatch tool.

2023-04-27,"Stocks Rise On Strong Earnings, Expectation Of Fed Rate Hikes Ending: Analyst Says 'No Earnings Recession In Cards Yet'","U.S. equities rallied across the board on Thursday, on the back of positive corporate earnings and expectations that a weaker-than-anticipated first-quarter GDP result will prompt the Fed to conclude rate hikes in May and later reverse its policy. Tech outperformed, fueled by optimism sparked by Microsoft Corp.'s (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platform's (NASDAQ:META) strong earnings. Cues From Thursday's Trading: All major U.S. equity indices traded deeply in the green, with both the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up by 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 soared 1.7% reclaiming the 13,000 level again.

He also noted that food companies are increasing prices, which could turn out to be negative for inflation expectations. The stalemate over raising the debt ceiling also kept traders on the sidelines, he noted.

What Happened: Spot gold was trading at $1,988.80 per ounce during Monday afternoon Asian trade, down 0.48%. The yellow metal is still far from the 2020 highs of close to 2,075 per ounce level while it faces the $2,000 per ounce mark as a stiff resistance.

Also Read: Gold IRA Kit Kiyosaki's comments come in the wake of the U.S. Treasury Department selling one-month bills at the highest-ever yield for the tenor. The government on Thursday sold $50 billion of four-week securities at a record yield of 5.84% which is the highest for any Treasury bill issue since 2000, reported Blomberg. Why It Matters: The record yields signal fear among investors after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned the government could run short of cash as soon as early June as the debt ceiling impasse continues. It is noteworthy that investors are willing to pay such a high yield for short-term securities during an auction when a risk-on environment prevails. In other words, market participants are diverting funds into safe-haven instruments, like treasuries, to prevent any potential melt-down in their portfolios in case the default actually takes place and markets go for a toss. Kiyosaki, who is a gold bull, also sounded out alarms about a possible crash in his tweet. FINANCIAL PANDEMIC started. Crash is now…, he said.

2023-05-08,"What's Driving Gold, Oil Prices Higher Today?","Gold prices rose on Monday as the dollar declined slightly with investors bracing for the release of the consumer price inflation data on Tuesday that will pave the way for the Federal Reserve's future monetary policy. What Happened: Spot gold was trading 0.36% higher near the $2,023 per ounce level during Monday morning Asian trading session, while dollar index trended lower by 0.11%, making the yellow metal attractive to offshore buyers. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) closed over 1.5% lower on Friday. Also Read: How To Invest In Oil Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade, told Reuters that any signs of inflation being subdued would hinder the dollar due to lower interest rate expectations from the central bank, which could see gold trend higher. Furthermore, other factors that could impact gold prices are the banking sector health in the U.S. as well as the debt ceiling crisis. Till either of these continue to persist, the safe haven appeal of gold will continue to attract investor interest, pushing prices higher. Oil: Strong labor data released on Friday calmed recessionary fears to some extent which boosted oil prices. West Texas Intermediate futures expiring in June was trading 0.6% higher at $71.76 per barrel on Monday morning. WTI prices are still below the highs of over $83 per barrel level attained in mid-April this year. The level has witnessed a strong resistance this year. Inflation data release in the U.S. and China, among other economic indicators, will be keenly watched out by oil traders this week. Meanwhile, Brent futures expiring in July 2023 were trading 0.53% higher at $75.72 per barrel at the time of writing. The United States Brent Oil Fund (NYSE:BNO) closed 3.99% higher while the Vanguard Energy Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VDE) gained 2.81% on Friday. Tina Teng, an analyst at CMC Markets said oil’s rebound follows energy stocks’ comeback on Wall Street on Friday after the U.S. reported strong job data that eased concerns about an imminent economic recession. Crude prices may continue to take the rebounding tailwind, Teng said, according to a Reuters report. ANZ Research pointed out that the market focus will shift to the tightening oil supply and that OPEC+ output cuts and a rebound in China's demand will likely offset slower demand elsewhere. We still expect overall demand to grow by 2mb/d, keeping the market under-supplied through this year. Therefore, we expect prices to bottom-out soon, it said.

With spot gold crossing above the $2,000 mark May 2 and back testing the level as support on Friday, bullish traders have been taking positions in ETFs in hopes that momentum will drive gold higher. The price of gold has increased over 11% since the start of 2023 and ETFs that track the commodity and the gold mining sector have seen increased bullish flow. Since May 1, GLD, which tracks the price of spot gold, has seen $727.06 million in net inflows. The bullish inflow into ETFs has also helped to increase the funds’ prices. GLD is up 11% year-to-date, and GDX, a gold mining equity ETF, has increased 23.52% over the course of this year. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The GLD Chart: GLD reversed into an uptrend on April 27 and has since made a series of higher highs and higher lows. The ETF’s most recent higher high was formed on Thursday at $191.36 and the most recent higher low was printed at the $185.77 mark on Friday. When GLD fell lower on Friday, the ETF back tested the 21-day exponential moving average as support and held above the level, which is healthy and bullish. On Tuesday, the ETF was working to print a bullish Marubozu candlestick, which suggests higher prices could be in the cards for Wednesday. If GLD continues higher over the next few days and prints a higher high, the ETF may find resistance at the all-time high of $193.30 at least temporarily. If GLD can burst up through that level, a blue-sky run could be on the horizon. Bearish traders want to see big bearish volume in and break GLD down from its uptrend with the formation of a lower low, or for the stock to top out under $192 and print a lower high. GLD has resistance above at $191.36 and the all-time high and resistance below at $188.08 and $184.42.

Spot gold was trading 0.16% higher at $2,024.60 per ounce during Tuesday afternoon Asian trade. Ajay Kedia, director at Mumbai-based Kedia Commodities told Reuters if the inflation report comes in hot and sparks concerns about another rate hike in June by the Federal Reserve, the price of the yellow metal could eventually drop to the $1,950-$1,920 level. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) closed over 0.1% higher on Monday. Also Read: How To Invest In Gold Another factor that could impact gold prices is the banking sector crisis. “If there is news of further stress in the banking sector, we will see gold move towards the $2,100 level,” Kedia said. This is because gold acts as a safe haven in times of distress and any signs of turmoil in the economy would send investors into a risk-off mode, driving fund flows into the yellow metal. Debt Ceiling: Meanwhile, the debt ceiling saga is also among the most watched events in current times that will determine the direction of markets and investor sentiments. President Joe Biden and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are scheduled to meet on Tuesday in regard to the debt ceiling crisis. However, the National Association of Government Employees Inc. (NAGE) – a union representing 75,000 federal agency and military employees – reportedly sued President Joe Biden and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday and have asked a federal judge to order Yellen to continue borrowing if talks to raise the national debt ceiling fail.

2023-05-09,Fed Chair Jerome Powell Grapples With Record Low Confidence Levels Amid Escalating Financial Worries,"American citizens' trust in Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has reached an all-time low, dipping below the trust levels of any other Fed Chair in history, according Gallup survey released Tuesday. The data comes at a time when insurance costs for U.S. debt default risk hit their highest since 2009. What To Know: The percentage of U.S. adults with a great deal or fair amount of confidence in the current Fed Chair fell from 43% in 2022 to 36% in 2023, the lowest ever recorded since the series began. Powell achieved the highest level of trust among Americans (58%) in 2020, when the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to their lowest level since the Great Financial Crisis. Also Read: Mitch McConnell Rules Out Helping Joe Biden On Debt Ceiling Crisis: 'They're Assuming There's Some Little Secret Plan Here' The previous lowest level of trust in a Fed chair was 36% in 2016, when the Fed chair was Janet Yellen, who is now the head of the U.S. Treasury. Alan Greenspan achieved the highest level of trust in 2001, when 74% of respondents expressed confidence in the Fed chair. Why It Matters: A lack of faith in Powell comes after the central bank delivered its quickest rate cycle in history, raising the Fed funds rate to 5-5.25% to combat multi-decade high inflation, and may signal some skepticism about the Fed's capacity to bring inflation back to target and stimulate growth. A lack of trust in a central banker may endanger the U.S. dollar's value versus real assets such as gold, which tends to thrive during periods of negative sentiment about the financial future. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is currently trading just 2.2% off its all-time highs. Read Next: Where's Gold Headed Amid Inflation, Banking Jitters?

If inflation continues to remain high, the Federal Reserve will be forced to continue its rate hikes, thereby leading to a potential rise in the greenback. A strength in dollar may not bode well for gold. Hareesh V, the research head at Geojit Financial Services, told Reuters that if the U.S. inflation remains moderately controlled, it may lead to a pause in Fed rate hikes, which will weaken the dollar and support gold.

2023-05-10,"CPI Reactions: S&P 500 Eyes Bull Market, Dollar Sinks, Treasuries And Gold Climb As Markets Embrace Potential Fed Pause","Market risk appetite soared on Wednesday, with the U.S. dollar plunging while gold, stocks, and bonds rallied after the latest inflation report for April boosted the odds that the Fed will keep interest rates unchanged in June. The annual U.S. CPI inflation rate came in at 4.9% in April, slightly lower than economists' 5% expected and down from 5% in March, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Wednesday. The underlying measure of inflation, which excludes food and energy goods from the basket, eased to 5.5% last month, slightly down from the 5.6% seen in March. Investors have further trimmed their already slim bets on a Fed hike in June, and currently assign an 87% likelihood of the rate remaining unchanged, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool. Market Reactions: The S&P 500 index, which is tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), rose 0.9% after the CPI was released, and is currently up 19.2% since the October 2022 lows, nearing the bull-market threshold.

2023-05-11,Peter Schiff On Why Gold Fell Wednesday: 'Persistent Inflation Is Actually Very Bullish' For Bullion,"After April consumer price inflation came in lower-than-expected on Wednesday, gold prices softened but continued to remain above the crucial $2,000 per ounce mark. Peter Schiff, chief economist and global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, said the fall in the prices of yellow metal could be attributed to market participants realizing there needs to be much more improvement in inflation numbers for the central bank to change its path. Also Read: How To Invest In Gold #Gold sold off as investors realized that the “good” news on #inflation is actually bad, as far more improvement [sic] would be needed to get the #Fed to officially pivot. But persistent inflation is actually very bullish for gold. When investors finally figure that out gold will soar, Schiff said in his tweet. Spot gold was trading at about $2,045 per ounce level on Wednesday but declined after the inflation report. It was trading near $2,032 per ounce during Thursday afternoon’s Asian trading session. Schiff also argued that April inflation numbers should not excite anyone given the fact that the 4.9% figure is still well above the central bank's 2% target. Expert Take: Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA told Reuters there’s still a risk the Federal Reserve will have to keep rates higher for longer. Gold is going to need more rate cuts to become aggressively priced in for it to continue its rally,” he said. This is because if interest rates in the U.S. come down, the dollar will soften and a weakened greenback tends to push gold prices higher.

More retail investors have voted for Bitcoin compared to the dollar as a safe haven choice but professional investors appear to be equally divided in their opinion on the assets, according to Bloomberg's latest Markets Live Pulse survey. Also Read: How to Buy Bitcoin (BTC) Although Bitcoin has fallen close to 10% in the last month, the cryptocurrency is still up over 64% since the beginning of the year. The asset's selection as a safe haven could be a result of investor pessimism as Washington's ability to sort out political stand-offs on the debt ceiling crisis seems to have dipped with the impasse entering the third week of May. It is noteworthy that June 1st is the X-date when the Treasury Department is expected to run out of cash if the debt limit is either not raised or suspended. Interestingly, about 60% of the survey respondents believe the risks are bigger this time as compared to 2011 which witnessed the worst debt-limit crisis of the past, the report said. In the latest development, President Joe Biden said he expects to meet with congressional leaders on Tuesday for talks on the debt ceiling crisis. The President was earlier set to meet with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and senior Congressional leaders on Friday but the meeting was postponed. Gold: More than half of finance professionals surveyed said gold is what they would buy if the U.S. does not honor its obligations, according to the report. However, relying on the asset as a safe haven in current times won't be cheap as the yellow metal is currently trading over the $2,000 per ounce mark compared to the lows of about $1,635 per ounce seen in November last year. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) closed 0.17% lower on Friday while the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) closed 0.21% lower.

US April Retail Sales: Key Takeaways Seasonally adjusted advance estimates of U.S. retail and food services sales for April 2023 came in at $686.1 billion, up 0.4% on the month and 1.6% year-over-year. The monthly print was below economists' expectations of an 0.8% increase. Retail sales bounced back in April after two consecutive months of decline in which they fell by 0.7% in February and 0.7% in March. Core retail sales, which excludes motor vehicles and parts, rose 0.4% monthly, as expected, after having fallen 0.5% in March and 0.6% in February. In annual terms, core retail sales were 2.1% higher. Excluding gasoline stations, core retail sales were 0.6% month-on-month higher in April, and up 4.3% from a year ago. Among different spending categories, the biggest monthly increases were recorded in miscellaneous store retailers and nonstore retailers, up by 2.4% and 1.2% on the month, respectively. The most significant monthly drags were observed in sporting goods, hobby, musical instrument and book store category and gasoline stations, which fell by 3.3% and 0.8% on the month, respectively.

2023-05-16,Analyzing US Retail Sales: Slowing Consumer Demand or Recessionary Pressure at Bay? Top Economists Weigh In,"Most economists are disappointed with April U.S. retail sales as consumer spending shows signs of weakness. According to the advance estimates released today, retail sales increased 0.4% in April month-over-month, rebounding from a revised 0.7% decline recorded in March but falling short of the expected 0.8% increase. Quincy Krosby, Chief Global Strategist of LPL Financial, thinks April U.S. retail sales were disappointing, suggesting cautious consumer spending with The Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) reporting mixed Q1 2023 results. While Bill Adams, Chief Economist of Comerica Bank, agrees with Krosby's view, he believes core sales were stronger than expected last month, and revisions were modestly negative. Adams sees consumer spending bottoming out this year on high-interest rates and the housing market downturn. He believes lower travels in April weighed on monthly gasoline sales volumes, as seen in the inconsistent services spending trend. On the contrary, Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer of Independent Advisor Alliance, believes that April U.S. retail sales came in strong, suggesting no sign of weaker consumer demand, and thinks recessionary pressure may be farther than currently being projected. Despite showing concern about risks related to regional banks issues, potential commercial real estate bust and debt ceiling standoff in the near term, Zaccarelli sees 2023 as a good year and cautions against 2024.

SOFT LANDiNG? HARD LANDING? Or CRASH LANDING? I say crash landing. I hope I am wrong yet that is what I believe. Corruption is high & leaders corrupt. Buy gokd, silver, Bitcoin. Still best insurance against corruption & incompetence, Kiyosaki said in his tweet. Also Read: How To Invest In Gold The author, however, did not elaborate on the specifics when he talked about corruption and incompetence. Hard Landing: However, the questions he raised about hard landing could potentially be indicating his expectations about the economy and the Federal Reserve's policy path in the wake of high inflation. There are varied opinions on the same among investors. While a section of Wall Street strongly believes there could be rate cuts down the year, some believe the central bank is not yet done raising rates given that inflation is still way higher than its 2% target. For instance, Johanna Chua, chief APAC economist at Citigroup Global Markets, reportedly said inflation is likely to be quite persistent and the Fed may go for two more rate hikes in coming times. At the same time, JPMorgan Asset Management is of the view that a recession in the U.S. is a virtual certainty and the central bank is likely to cut interest rates by the third quarter as growth fizzles out. Price Action: Indeed, as Kiyosaki points out, gold is a good inflation hedge. The commodity has made a significant rally over the last few months as high inflation made investors divert funds from risky assets to the safe haven metal. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) have gained over 6% since the beginning of the year. Bitcoin, too, has registered solid returns this year, gaining over 61% on a year-to-date basis, according to Benzinga Pro. The debt ceiling impasse, which continued into the third week of May, is one major factor other than inflation that could spook Wall Street in the short term.

2023-05-24,US Stocks Plunge Ahead Of FOMC Minutes As Debt Ceiling Talks Show Little Progress: Investors Flock To Cash As Risk-Off Mood Returns,"Risk sentiment took a severe hit on Wednesday, with investors fleeing stocks for cash as debt negotiations between the White House and GOP grind on. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said the parties are still far apart on a number of things. Markets are anxiously awaiting the minutes from the May FOMC meeting, due at 2 p.m. ET, for more hints about upcoming Fed actions. Investors will also be watching Nvidia Corp.

The spark that triggers cash flowing from the sidelines into the market could be any positive news emerging from the technology sector, such as Apple, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) new iPhone announcement in September, he said. Given 2024 is a presidential election year, the Federal Reserve, not wanting to be part of the economic debate, may begin to cut interest rates either later this year or in early 2024, the fund manager said. This could also provide the market the spark it needs, he added. “It is important to realize that there is going to be wave after wave of positive news on inflation, interest rates and economic growth that will be coaxing investors back into the stock market,” Navellier said.

2023-05-25,"Unemployment Claims Fall Short Of Expectations, Signaling Tight Job Market; Q1 GDP And Core PCE Revised Higher","The U.S. job market continues to display strength and durability, while both the U.S. economy and intrinsic inflation pressures experienced a greater surge than initially projected in the previous quarter. The number of Americans registering for unemployment benefits in the week ending May 20 rose by 4,000 to 229,000, well below the expected 245,000, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday. Concurrently, the Bureau of Economic Analysis raised its preliminary estimate of the nation's GDP growth in the preceding quarter from 1.1% to 1.3%. Key Takeways From Last Week's US Unemployment Claims Initial jobless claims came in at 229,000, rising from a revised lower level of 225,000 the prior week, and well below expectations of 245,000. The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which eliminates week-to-week variability, remained steady at 231,750, below the expected 258,970. Continuing jobless claims for the week ended May 13 fell from 1,799,000 to 1,794,000, below than the forecasted 1,800,000. Noteworthy drops in jobless claims were reported in Massachusetts, down by 2,190 for the week, and in Michigan, down by 1,070. Notable increases in claims were reported in Texas, up 2,680, and in Connecticut, up 2,498. Key Takeaways From Q1 GDP's 2nd Estimate The quarterly annualized rate of economic growth for the first quarter of 2023 in the United States has been revised up from 1.1% to 1.3% due to an upward revision in private inventory investment. The GDP price index, or deflator, was 3.8%, the same as in the advance reading. The core price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which excludes food and energy, was revised higher last quarter, from an annualized 4.9% to 5%, indicating an upward adjustment in underlying price pressures. Market Reactions: The U.S. dollar index, which is tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), strengthened by rising 0.2% after the data prints. The S&P 500 futures are up 0.2% an hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. Gold, which is tracked by SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), plummeted 0.8% to $1,944/oz.

2023-05-25,"AI FOMO Drives Stock Surge: Nasdaq Reaches 13-Month High With NVIDIA's Boom, Traders Eye Another Fed Rate Hike","Tech bulls resurfaced on Thursday, boosting the Nasdaq 100 to April 2022 levels. The resurgence was fueled by an AI-driven rally, sparked by Nvidia Corp's (NASDAQ:NVDA) impressive 27% surge after posting stellar quarterly earnings. The move higher came despite traders raising their expectations for a Fed rate hike by July and debt ceiling talks still failing to produce a final deal. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said that negotiators had made some progress on a debt limit deal and that a solution may be reached soon, although issues remain. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the Biden administration is preparing a contingency strategy to deal with U.S. federal agencies' payments beyond the debt limit deadline. On the data front, the labor market continued to show signs of strength as jobless claims for last week fell short of expectations, while both the GDP and core PCE inflation have been revised higher for the first quarter. Meanwhile, money markets' implied expectations for Fed interest rate hikes are increasing, with the latest CME Group Fedwatch tool assigning a nearly 50% likelihood of a June increase and a nearly 85% probability of a 25-basis-point hike by July. Cues From Thursday’s Trading: On Thursday, the tech sector emerged as the top performer, with the Nasdaq 100 Index climbing 2.3%. This surge was driven by investors' fear of missing out (FOMO) on the AI rally. The S&P 500 Index was 0.6% higher, while the Dow Jones fell 0.3%. Small caps in the Russell 2000 index were falling 1.3% lower. U.S. Indices' Performance On Wednesday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq 100 +2.3% 13,918.18 S&P 500 Index +0.6% 4,153.87 Dow Industrials -0.3% 32,700.16 Analyst Color: The market has weathered ongoing headwinds fairly well and has shown resilience, but an analyst cautioned that this could be false hope. Morgan Stanley market strategist Mike Wilson noted that the S&P 500 is showing signs of breaking out of the 3,800-4,200 narrow trading range that has defined it for the past six months. The analyst, however, feels market fundamentals are less attractive today than they were six months ago and risks are elevated. “While AI could lead to some substantial efficiencies that help fight inflation, it’s likely no match for the earnings recession that we forecast for this year,” Wilson said. The analyst said he believes the rally will prove to be a “head fake” as seen last summer, given the unattractive valuations, too-optimistic earnings estimates, investors’ unrealistic expectations regarding a Fed rate cut, and the markets turning a blind eye to key risks such as the banking crisis. Thursday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading on Thursday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.4% higher to $412.95, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) fell 0.6% to $326.06 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 2.2% higher to $338.84, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) fell the most, down 2%, followed by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU), down 1.6% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLV), down 1.4% Latest Economic Data: Initial jobless claims came in at 229,000 last week, rising from a revised lower level of 225,000 the prior week, and well below expectations of 245,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The quarterly annualized rate of economic growth for the first quarter of 2023 in the United States has been revised up from 1.1% to 1.3% due to an upward revision in private inventory investment, the Bureau of Economic Analysis reported. The National Association Of Realtors reported a flat monthly change in its pending home sales index for April, against a 0.5% month-over-month increase expected and following a 5.2% drop in March. Boston Fed President Susan Collins says FOMC may be at, or near, the point of rate-hike pause.

Crosby said he sees House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA)'s comment that not everybody is going to be happy at the end of the day” as a positive. “Political ‘horse trading,’ the basis for successful negotiating, demands that both sides are left with complaints, not one side or the other,” the analyst said. “This, coupled with reports that the sides are working late into the night and returning each other's calls has only added to the cautious optimism that a deal is the offing.” The analyst sees positive sentiment out of Nvidia’s earnings, Best Buy, Inc.'s (NYSE:BBY) upbeat results and headlines pointing to a debt ceiling resolution to “finally help lift a broader underpinning of the market.” Friday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading on Friday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 1.2% higher to $419.72, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.9% to $330.70 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 2.5% higher to $348.10, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-06-01,"PIMCO Executive Says Gold Still Looks Expensive Despite Recent Declines, But Long-Term Sheen Intact","PIMCO's Greg Sharenow reportedly said that despite the recent decline in prices, gold still looks expensive and might even witness further losses although long-term appeal still remains. Sharenow said persisting inflation will make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to meaningfully trim rates, according to a report by Bloomberg. Also Read: How To Invest In Gold Gold is modestly over-valued versus inflation-linked government bonds, or TIPs, and those are probably better valued in multi-asset portfolios for now, he said. Real bond yields are likely to stay higher for longer, Sharenow noted. Spot gold was trading 0.1% higher at $1,964 per ounce during Thursday afternoon Asian trading session. Strong labor data released Wednesday sparked investor concerns about further rate hikes by the Fed. There were 1.8 job openings for every unemployed person in April, up from 1.7 in the previous month. Price Action: Gold is still trading over 15% higher than the lows seen in September last year. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) gained over 6% since the beginning of the year. The biggest challenge one has right now is to figure out the lagged effects of any credit tightening that is coming from some of the central banks, stated Sharenow. The uncertainty band still remains fairly wide. However, the executive believes the long-term outlook for gold looks upbeat as central banks look to diversify holdings away from dollar assets. The safety and security of gold right now have a high currency to them, he said, There's a lot of countries that are questioning their dollar reserves.

2023-06-01,"Booming ADP Employment, Stable Unemployment Claims Set Stage For Friday's Key May Jobs Report","The American labor market continues to demonstrate its strength, with the ADP reporting Thursday a notable and better-than-expected surge in private employment in May. Concurrently, the Department of Labor signaled a lower-than-anticipated rise in unemployment claims last week, further reinforcing healthy conditions in the job market. These figures serve as a prelude to the highly anticipated nonfarm payroll report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics scheduled for release Friday, alongside updates on the unemployment rate and wage growth. May's ADP Employment Report: What You Need To Know Private businesses recorded an increase of 278,000 jobs in May, a slight dip from the revised figure of 291,000 in April but significantly surpassing the expected 170,000, as reported by Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) on Thursday. According to Nela Richardson, ADP's chief economist, there has been a notable decline in pay growth for job changers for the second consecutive month. Pay growth is slowing considerably, suggesting that wage-driven inflation may be less of a concern for the economy despite robust hiring. The growth in employment primarily stemmed from small and midsized companies, which added 235,000 and 140,000 jobs, respectively. In contrast, large companies reported a decline of 106,000 jobs. The services sector exhibited positive performance by creating 168,000 jobs, led by the leisure/hospitality sector with 208,000 jobs and trade/transportation/utilities with 32,000 jobs. Other industries experienced declines, with financial activities witnessing 35,000 layoffs. Within the goods-producing industry, there was an overall addition of 110,000 jobs. The natural resources/mining sector contributed 94,000 jobs, construction contributed 64,000 jobs and manufacturing reported a decrease of 48,000 jobs.

The ETF is the world's biggest with approximately $400 billion in assets under management.

Tech Supremacy: The technology and communication services sectors account for around 37% of the total S&P 500 index.

2023-06-01,"US Stocks Rebound, Dollar And Treasury Yields Decline As Traders Reassess Fed Policy And Welcome House Approval Of Debt Ceiling Bill","The U.S. stock market rallied on Thursday, as traders revised down their expectations for a Fed rate rise in June, after more dovish-than-expected comments by Fed members in the past days. According to Jefferson, the Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady in June in order to better assess the economic outlook. Harker, who is also a member of the FOMC, echoed his comments, adding, I think we can take a bit of a skip for a meeting. Meanwhile, investors welcomed the approval of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 by the House of Representatives by a vote of 314-117. The measure has been sent to the Senate and is quite likely to pass before the June 5 default date. On the macro front, the labor market continues to show indications of tightness, with ADP reporting a 270,000 job rise in May, much above the projected 170,000, ahead of tomorrow's crucial nonfarm payroll data.

The Russell 2000 gained 1.2%, the Nasdaq 100 up 1.1%, the S&P 500 up 1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.8%.

While the S&P 500 continues to struggle with resistance at 4,200, overbought conditions have become widespread across the technology sector, he noted. Turnquist said the tech sector, which has a 28% weighting in the S&P 500 Index, has been responsible for most of the index gains this year. “While overbought conditions provide validation of the tech sector’s uptrend, and overbought does not mean over, probabilities for a temporary consolidation and/or pullback appear to be growing,” the analyst said. If there is mean reversion, it would likely be toward the sector’s uptrend and provide a potential pullback opportunity for investors seeking a better entry point into tech, he added.

2023-06-05,S&P 500 Enters Bull Market Territory: Investors Bet On Fed Holding Rates Steady In June As Services Sector Expansion Slows,"The S&P 500 index continued to rise at the start of the week, firmly entering bull market territory after rising 23% from its October 2022 lows. On Monday, investors digested a significantly lower-than-expected ISM Services figure for May, which fell to the lowest levels in five months, indicating a slowing in demand momentum. The data further solidified investor expectations that the Fed will keep rates unchanged at its meeting next week on June 14. The market-implied market probability of a rate hike has fallen to a mere 23%. Cues From Monday's Trading: The session was mixed for U.S. stocks. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 index ticked higher, by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000 index traded in the red, down 0.2% and 0.9%, respectively.

Friday’s rally was inclusive, the analyst said, noting that the Russell 2000 marched higher along with its large-cap peers — a dynamic that has been missing since the onset of the banking crisis. The Russell 2000’s small-cap and mid-cap participation is especially important due to the index being a bellwether for the broader economy and the fact that it comprises a cross-section of small and regional banks, Crosby said. Today’s rally doesn’t mean the market isn’t facing significant headwinds, the analyst warned. To be sure, the ramifications of the deluge of Treasury notes — approximately $1 trillion worth of notes — soon to be auctioned by the Treasury as it replenishes its General Account, could ignite a significant sapping of liquidity from financial markets. Crosby is of the view the Fed’s insinuation that a June hike is off the table could be reflecting the central bank’s concerns regarding the potential for increased market volatility stemming from dissipating liquidity.

2023-06-06,Bond-Expert Jeffrey Gundlach Says 'Pretty Clear' US Soon To Be At The Front-End Of A Recession,"DoubleLine Capital CEO Jeffrey Gundlach reportedly said on Tuesday it looks increasingly possible the United States will tip into a recession. It's pretty clear that we have the look of soon to be at the front end of a recession, Gundlach said during a DoubleLine investor webcast, according to a CNBC report. He added that indicators including ISM new orders and the purchasing managers' index appeared to be signaling a downturn. Also Read: How to Invest in Startups The famed investor and bond expert pointed out that ISM supplier delivery delays are near their lowest levels in 30 years, showing greater supply than demand, which further shows signs of a weak economy. He also highlighted the inversion of 2-year and 10-year Treasury note yields, where shorter-dated bills yield more than longer-dated ones, indicative of the chances of a recession. Gundlach's take stands in contrast to Goldman Sachs' prediction about the economy. The investment bank has revised its estimate about the U.S.' chance of entering a recession over the next 12 months, reducing its judging probability from 35% to 25%. On Fed: Gundlach's comments come at a time when market participants are keenly awaiting the Federal Reserve meeting outcome next week along with the release of the inflation data. We're at very low unemployment. That is what is keeping the Fed on the snugger side, he said. Goldman Sachs has factored in a further 25-basis-point rise, expected to take effect in July. Preferred Portfolio: Gundlach also highlighted his preferred portfolio mix right now consists of 30% stocks, 60% bonds and 10% real assets. In terms of real assets, the investor said he favors gold, even though he's now less bullish compared to earlier times. Spot gold was trading 0.03% higher at $1,963 per ounce during Wednesday morning Asian trading session. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) gained 0.11% on Tuesday, according to Benzinga Pro.

2023-06-13,Surprise Dip In May Inflation Raises Hopes For Pause In Fed Rate Hikes,"Inflation decelerated more than expected in May, bolstering investor optimism regarding the conclusion of Fed rate hikes. The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) rose 4% year-on-year in May, down from 4.9% in April, according to figures released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday. The much-awaited inflation report came in slightly below the 4.1% average economist expectation and marks the lowest inflation reading since March 2021. Inflation Falls In May: What You Need To Know The annual CPI inflation rate was 4% last month, falling from the 4.9% recorded in April and coming in below the 4.1% predicted by analysts. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased by 0.1% in May, slowing from a 0.4% increase in April. The figure was below the 0.2% forecasted by economists. Falling energy prices continued to drive down overall inflation in May. The energy index declined 3.6% in May and is down 11.7% compared to a year ago. Food prices ticked 0.2% higher on a monthly basis, and were 6.7% higher than a year ago. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy goods from the CPI basket, increased 5.3% year-on-year, down from April’s 5.6% reading but slightly above the 5.2% expected. The monthly core inflation print was 0.4%, which was in line with both April’s figure and the consensus 0.4% estimate. Services items continue to contribute to overall CPI inflation, with shelter rising 0.4% on the month and 8% year-on-year. The inflation report is expected to bolster the case for a pause in the Fed’s tightening cycle on Wednesday.

Evidence of a regime shift from high to low implied volatility is building, the analyst said referring to the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, which recently fell to a multi-year low of 14.5 as of June 15. This has placed the index in the fourth quintile group after spending most of last year at above-average levels. Turnquist noted that historically, periods of high volatility are followed by periods of low volatility, especially during the transition from a bear to a bull market. While high implied volatility has historically produced the highest average S&P 500 returns, the standard deviation around these returns is also relatively high, he said. Periods of low volatility have historically generated above-average returns with less dispersion.

Nearly all FOMC participants anticipated it would be reasonable to raise interest rates somewhat more by year’s end, Powell said, stressing that the decision to pause hikes doesn’t mean the end of tightening.

2023-06-23,"US Supply Chain, Manufacturing Data Hints At Impending Slowdown: Stocks Plummet, Safe Havens Rally As Uncertainties Rise","U.S. economic activity, as indicated by S&P Global’s Purchasing Managers’ Indices (PMI), is displaying the first symptoms of deceleration, putting a halt to the strong pace of expansion seen so far this year. The Composite flash PMI reading for June revealed a weakening economic picture Friday, falling from 54.3 in May to 53 in June. Activity expansion in the service sector slowed from 54.9 in June to 54.1 in June, while manufacturing activity accelerated the pace of contraction, down from 48.4 to 46.3. This tendency appears to be widely shared across advanced economies, as flash June PMI data from the Eurozone, Japan and the United Kingdom also reveal a lower-than-expected increase in private sector activity. The slowdown in global economic activity comes at a time when major central banks are emphasizing the need of further increases in interest rates to combat persistent inflation. The Bank of England stunned markets this week by raising interest rates more than expected, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell provided hawkish remarks during his speech before Congress. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Thursday the chances of a U.S. recession have decreased, while acknowledging the need for some spending restraint to bring inflation under control, while Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said Friday that he is not seeing signs of risk in the economy. US PMIs For June: Key Highlights The S&P Global Flash US PMI Composite Output Index came in at 53 in June, still indicating an expansion but at the slowest pace in three months. A continued increase in new orders drove the output trend, but price pressures gained intensity in June, reversing the downward momentum. Manufacturer confidence fell to a six-month low due to fears about inflation and fewer sales. Yet service firms reported the highest level of optimism since May 2022. The S&P Global Flash US Services Business Activity Index came in at 54.1 in June, still indicating an expansion but at a slower pace than in May (54.9). Demand for services remained strong, but firms reported a faster rise in input prices at the end of the second quarter, and the rate of job creation slowed to the lowest since January due to difficulties replacing voluntary departures. The S&P Global Flash US Manufacturing PMI continued to plummet in contraction territory, down from 48.4 in May to 46.3 in June, hitting a six-month low. Manufacturers registered the strongest rate of contraction in new orders since December 2022. Firms opted to run down their stocks and reduce input purchasing in June amid sluggish demand prospects. Price pressures further eased. Employment slowed slightly but remained among the strongest months in a year thanks to a better supply of available workers. Market Reactions: Stocks Fall, Safe Havens Rise Stocks took a hit on Friday, with the S&P 500 index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), down 0.8% for the session, stopping its five-week winning streak.

2023-06-26,"Gold Edges Up On Russia's Internal Chaos, Soft Dollar: What's Capping More Gains?","Gold prices inched higher during the Asian trading session on Monday after an attempted coup by Wagner Group mercenaries against Russian President Vladimir Putin over the weekend, which increased demand for safe-haven assets. During Monday afternoon’s Asian trading session, spot gold traded 0.2% higher at $1,925 per ounce. The weakening of the dollar also contributed to the bullish sentiment in gold. However, the upside potential for the commodity remained limited as Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin abruptly halted his advance toward Moscow. Also Read: Gold IRA Kit One factor constraining further gains in gold prices is the fear of extended rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Despite the pause in rate hikes during the Fed’s June policy meeting, concerns have grown as Chair Jerome Powell indicated the possibility of raising rates by an additional 50 basis points this year.

2023-06-30,Has Gold Lost Safe-Haven Appeal? Portfolio Manager Otavio Costa Says That's 'Backward-Looking And Dismissive' Thinking,"Otavio Costa, a portfolio manager at Crescat Capital, does not agree with the notion that gold has ceased to be a good hedge during bad times and believes the yellow metal is in the early stages of its re-emergence as a safe haven asset. Costa highlighted his disagreement citing a Bloomberg opinion piece by George Mason University professor Tyler Cowen which argued that the yellow metal has become a cyclical asset and is no longer a useful harbinger of social and economic collapse. Also Read: Best Penny Stocks It is completely backward-looking and dismissive of what appears to be the early stages of gold re-emerging as the ultimate haven asset. Given the dire levels of global debt, foreign central banks are compelled to prioritize enhancing the quality of their international reserves to support their monetary systems, Costa said in his tweet. The expert pointed out that central banks function similarly to traditional businesses that require high-quality assets on their balance sheets to establish financial stability. Ultimately, other notable institutions such as pension and endowment funds will likely follow suit. By the end of this decade, conventional 60/40 portfolios will probably become much more balanced with the inclusion of other asset classes like gold, Costa said. Central banks have been increasing their holdings of gold in their reserves in recent times — they added a whopping 1,136 tonnes of the yellow metal to their stockpiles in 2022, which is by far the most of any year in records going back to 1950, said a Reuters report published in February, citing the World Gold Council. Price Action: Spot gold was trading 0.28% lower during Friday’s Asian trade at $1,902 per ounce in the wake of strong U.S. economic data and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell asserting there need to be two more rate hikes to bring inflation under control. Inflation pressures continue to run high, and the process of getting inflation back down to 2% has a long way to go, Powell had said. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) fell 1.4% in the last five days while the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) lost 1.39% during the period.

2023-07-03,Gold Miners Trading At Bargain Price To Gold: Is GDX The Buy Opportunity For The Remainder Of 2023?,"Gold prices, as tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), closed the first half of 2023 with a shy performance of 5%, significantly underperforming the equity asset class, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) up by 16% and with the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) up by a staggering 38%. But while prices of the precious metal are only 7% off their all-time highs, steep price discounts are clearly visible among gold mining stocks. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is trading one-third lower than its highs in 2020 and 54% lower than its all-time highs in 2011, attracting the attention of value hunters. By simply correlating the price of gold (GLD) to that of the Gold Miners ETF (GDX), the latter should be trading at least 30% higher than current levels when looking at a 5-year timeframe. Does this present a buy opportunity for investors to enter an undervalued sector before its recovery, or is it a potential value trap waiting to unfold? North American Gold Miners Offer Attractive Valuations When analyzing the U.S.-listed large-cap gold miners included in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF, they stood out with highly appealing valuations according to common stock metrics, including price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, price-to-book (P/B) ratios, and price-to-median analyst price target spreads. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), one of the largest gold producers globally and is headquartered in Colorado, trades at 15 times its projected 12-month earnings, showing one of the lowest forward P/E ratio of its history. Compared to the median analyst price target ($59), NEM currently trades at $43.1 per share, effectively implying a 38% discount. Another industry giant with a similar forward P/E to Newmont is Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD), which is trading at a 30% discount to the median analyst price target. Barrick Gold also screens price-to-book value of 1.3x, which is one of the lowest for the North American market. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM), a Canadian-diversified gold mining company operating across Canada, Finland, and Mexico, is trading at a 22x forward P/E ratio, well below its 5-year average of 38.9x. When looking at the median analyst price target ($65), AEM current market prices ($50) imply a 30% discount.

2023-07-05,"US Stocks Slip, Treasury Yields Rise Ahead Of Fed Minutes: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?","Stocks eased on Wednesday as investors took a more cautious stance prior to the release of the Fed minutes for the June 14 meeting. The minutes are expected to reveal that the committee broadly agrees that additional interest rate hikes are required to combat inflation. While June’s economic projections and Fed Chair Jerome Powell‘s most recent comments hint at two additional rate hikes in 2023, market participants only anticipate a single rate hike in July. The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds approached 3.9%, the highest level since March 10, effectively returning to levels prior to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. Elsewhere, services PMIs pointed to the slowest pace of growth in China thus far this year and a bigger than-predicted loss of momentum for the eurozone. Wednesday Recap: The S&P 500 Index slipped 0.2%, while the Dow Jones lost 120 points or 0.4%.

The analyst expects the index to end the year at 4,825, up from his earlier estimate of 4,750 and also exceeding the previous all-time high of 4,821. The aggressive view, according to the analyst, is predicated on headline inflation downshifting to 3% in the second half, the Fed pointing to real progress and investors beginning to allocate a $5.5-trillion cash pile toward equity. He noted that S&P 500 earnings per share growth, excluding that of energy, inflected positive in the second quarter of 2023.

2023-07-05,Constellation Brands - A Diversified Tale Of Making The Best Of A Slow Growth Industry,"Unlike Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) that is all about the tech stocks changing the world, the S&P 500 is more about what makes the world, as as its members, also held by SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) that is designed to follow the index, tell the tale of economic health and stability. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is the largest and oldest ETF in the word. In January, this first U.S. exchange-traded fund turned 30, followed by its tech peer the Invesco QQQ Trust that was launched in 1999 in the dotcom bubble era and the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) that debuted in the early stages of a commodity boom back in 2004. The Diversified Tale Of Constellation Brands Constellation Brands Inc (NYSE:STZ) might not be in the S&P but it is a Fortune 500 company, the largest beer import company in the US by sales with the third-largest market share of all major beer suppliers. Beer is one of the original alcoholic beverages that was developed at the dawn of human civilization and is now a staple of the world’s economy. So, Constellation’s tale does reflect a lot of macroeconomic conditions. But what’s interesting about Constellation is that it is one of the largest diversified beverage companies around. Along with its well known beer brands, Corona, Modelo, and Pacifico and several wine and spirits brands, it also owns almost 40% of Canopy Growth Corporation (NASDAQ:CGC), a deal that for now has not lived up to expectations as last October, Constellations wrote down the value of its stake in Canopy Growth by as much as $1.06 billion. Until recently, Constellation was enjoying a double-digit-percentage sales growth from its beer brands which account for almost three-quarters of its revenue and almost 80% of its total profits. But growth is now slowing down to a single-digit-percentage pace, joined by rising input costs. However, only 30% of Constellation’s operating profit margin is dependent on this alcoholic beverage. The beer industry is dominated by massive conglomerates like Heineken (OTC:HEINY) the world’s second largest brewer and even Heineken warned earlier this ear that full year operating profit would grow but at a slower rate due to an economic slowdown despite beer drinking having returned to pre-pandemic levels that fueled a better-than-expected 2022 profit. Constellation’s Revamping Seems To Be Working On Friday, Constellation Brands reported better than expected Q1 results due to a more than 40% improvement in e-commerce direct to consumer sales, showing that consumers are successfully adopting D2C digital channels. CEO Bill Newland revealed that the company’s omnichannel strategy resulted in the creation of additional pillars of consumer-led growth, such as international and D2C, with the later boosting the channel’s net sales 13% in the reported quarter. Wells Fargo analysts noted that the May quarter was the first sequential relief and quarterly improvement in nearly two years, despite higher-than-expected marketing sending as Constellation has been learning from its soda business to induce drive beer growth. Constellations maintained its fiscal year 2024 guidance, guiding for EPS in the range of $11.70 to $12.00, excluding its Canopy Growth. Net sales growth is expected in the range between 7% and 9% for beer, while organic wine and spirits are guided in the range between negative 0.5% and positive 0.5%. Debt Somewhat Spoils The Picture Unlike Boston Beer, Constellation has debt, and this is an often occurrence at massive global beer conglomerates in this slow-growth industry. As of May 2023, Constellation Brands owed $12.3 billion of debt, which means it added $11 billion, with the figure being comprised of short-term liabilities amounting to $3.19 billion long-term liabilities of $12.7 billion. On the other side is $192.5 million in cash along with receivables valued at $933.1 million due within 12 months. Therefore, liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and near-term receivables by $14.7 billion. Fortunately, Constellation Brands has a market cap of $45.1 billion so it is able to raise capital. But, with debt being 3.7 times its EBITDA, its EBIT cover its interest expense 6.7 times over and its EBIT have dropped 7.3% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue to decline, debt will become an issue. Although the balance sheet is the place to look at when there’s debt in question, in Constellation’s case, it is future earnings that will more than anything determine its fate.

2023-07-06,"Stocks Tumble, Yields Climb As Investors Fear Upcoming Rate Hikes Amid Booming Job Growth: What's Driving Markets Thursday?","Thursday saw heightened risk aversion across markets, with all major U.S. indices losing ground and the VIX volatility Index rising by more than 17%, making it one of the most volatile days of the year so far. The release of a healthy ADP employment number raised investor expectations that the Federal Reserve may resume interest rate hikes and perhaps extend them beyond the summer. With 497,000 new jobs added in June, above May’s result of 267,000 and predictions of 228,000, concerns are growing that the Fed will become more hawkish. In reaction, traders revised their estimates for future Fed rate hikes, assigning an almost certain probability to a July boost and a roughly 50-50 chance of another hike by November. Furthermore, the most recent FOMC minutes revealed an unusual level of dissent among participants, increasing concerns that more hawkish members may acquire power over the board. As investors await Friday’s job market report, which will reveal June nonfarm payrolls (expected to be around 225,000) and the unemployment rate (expected to be 3.6%), many expect the data will confirm stronger-than-expected job market performance, following the impressive ADP National Employment Report.

2023-07-12,CPI Inflation Falls To Lowest Level Since March 2021: Traders Rethink Fed's Policy Outlook,"The U.S. consumer price index (CPI) inflation decelerated more than predicted in June, increasing investor conviction that the Fed may decide for only one more rate hike and then halt its tightening cycle. The annual inflation rate in the United States dropped from 4% in May to 3% in June, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Wednesday. The long-awaited inflation report is just below the the average economist prediction of 3.1%, and marked the twelfth consecutive month of declining inflation and the lowest reading since March 2021. Inflation Falls In June: Key Highlights The annual increase in the U.S. CPI was 3% last month, down from the 4% recorded in May and coming in below the 3.1% estimate. On a monthly basis, the CPI inflation increased by 0.2% in June, accelerating from the 0.1% increase in May. The figure was below the 0.3% forecast. Energy prices rose 0.6% in June after a 3.6% monthly drop in May, and were down 16.7% compared to a year ago. Food prices ticked 0.1% higher on a monthly basis, and were 5.7% higher than a year ago. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy goods from the CPI basket, increased 4.8% year-on-year, well below May's 5.3% reading and missing the 5% expected. Core inflation rose 0.2% month-over-month in June, below both the 0.4% gain seen in May and the 0.3% increase economists predicted. It marks the the smallest monthly increase in core inflation since August 2021. Services were the main contributor to overall CPI inflation, with shelter rising 0.4% on the month and 7.8% year-on-year.

The chances of another rate hike in September increased from 18.5% prior to the release to 15% after the print. The market assigns a 31% probability of two Fed rate hikes by November, down from 33% prior to the CPI release. The dollar, as closely tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (ARCA: UUP), tumbled 0.6% in the minutes following the June CPI data. The U.S. dollar gauge fell to the lowest since early May. Treasury yields sharply declined, with the 10-year yield down 8 basis points to 3.88% and the two-year yield down 13 basis points to 4.75%. S&P 500 futures rose 1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures were 1.2% higher, ahead of the Wall Street opening bell. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) finished the last two sessions in the green.

2023-07-13,Tech Stocks Lead Market Upsurge As Inflation And Fed Tightening Fears Diminish: Thursday's Market Movers,"U.S. stocks are on track to post their fourth straight session of gains on Thursday, as lower-than-expected producer inflation reports reinforced market perceptions that pricing pressures have lost their grip on the economy, potentially lessening the Fed’s need to tighten interest rates further after July. A measure of the U.S. dollar plummeted to levels unseen since mid-April 2022, while Treasury yields continued to soften as market bets on two Fed rate hikes this year collapsed. Tech was the top performing sector, with all seven S&P 500 heavyweights in the green, led by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which gained 4.5%. Amazon Inc.

Fund manager Louis Navellier said he sees the decline in Treasury bond yields as a very good sign,” raising the likelihood of the Federal Reserve pausing at the July meeting. I want to assure you that everything is about to get better, he said, adding that he expects a steady improvement in corporate earnings over the next four quarters. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley’s Lisa Shalett warned of potential risks, citing bond volatility, surging interest rates, and a resilient U.S. dollar.

2023-07-14,"US Stocks Eye 5th Straight Green Session, Semiconductors Jump To Fresh All-Time Highs: The Markets Friday","U.S. stocks are set for a fifth consecutive session of gains, with the S&P 500 Index rising 2.7% this week, its strongest weekly performance since March and reaching its highest level since April 2022. Encouraging reports from major financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo Company (NYSE:WFC), indicate the sector has responded positively since the crisis in March. In the semiconductor sector, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:SMH) reached new all-time highs, surpassing previous records set in November 2021. Investors welcomed an impressive University of Michigan consumer sentiment report for July, as the index surged 12% compared to the previous month, reaching its highest level since September 2021. This positive sentiment was driven by decreasing inflation and a resilient job market. Yet the survey also revealed an increase in both short-term and long-term consumer inflation expectations. Chart Of The Week: S&P 500 Headed For Second-Best Week Of The Year Cues From Friday's Trading: The S&P 500 ticked 0.2% higher, while the Nasdaq 100 Index rose 0.6%.

The Fed would still want to see a similar retrenchment in the core CPI inflation and therefore an interest rate hike on Sept. 20 remains a viable possibility, the analyst said. The ‘insurance’ rate hike that may be needed by the more hawkish side of the FOMC may ultimately win out, but all market indicators are pointing to a Fed that is moving closer to the end game, Krosby said. Friday’s Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading on Friday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.1% higher to $450.16, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.3% to $345.17 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 0.6% higher to $381.23, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The Dow crossed the 35,000 milestone, on track for its fourth straight session of gains. Strong earnings remain the driving force behind the stock market, while investors eagerly await quarterly results from Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NYSE:UAL), all of which are scheduled to report after the closing bell. The market is now entering a light week in terms of macroeconomic releases, with only the S&P Global Flash PMI on Monday being in the spotlight before the pivotal event of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday, July 26. A lower-than-expected U.K. inflation rate, combined with increased speculation that the ECB may stop raising interest rates after July, created pressures in both the euro and the pound, fueling a rebound in the U.S. dollar index. Cues From Wednesday’s Trading: After officially entering a bull market on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to outperform other U.S. major averages on Wednesday, rising 0.4% for the day. The S&P 500 Index gained 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 inched 0.1% higher. Small caps in the Russell 2000 edged 0.2% higher.

The results on the surface probably won't offer much to write home about given consensus estimates imply a 7% year-over-year decline in S&P 500 earnings per share, said Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist, and Quincy Crosby, chief global strategist. “However, the key question is always what's priced in, which at least offers an opportunity for markets to react positively.” LPL's best guess, according to the analysts, is “typical upside surprises and guidance reductions,” giving this rally a convenient excuse to take a breather. Carson Group's Ryan Detrick, who is in the bullish camp, noted a historical trend that is positive for the market. The Russell 2,000 Index, comprising of small-cap stocks, had a gold cross technical move, i.e. the 50-day simple moving average crossing over above the longer-term 200-day moving average. This has happened 17 times in history and the market was higher three months later all the 17 times, BeSpoke's analysis showed, Detrick tweeted. Russell 2k recently had a Golden Cross (50-day MA moved above the 200-day MA).According to @bespokeinvest this has happened 17 other times in history.

2023-07-20,"Jobless Claims Fall More Than Expected, But Investors Still Expect Fed Hike Next Week","The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits was lower than anticipated last week, again demonstrating the strength and resilience of the U.S. labor market. The Department of Labor reported 228,000 unemployment filings for the week ending July 15, a decrease from the previous week’s figure of 237,000, and below the 242,000 economists had predicted. The latest initial unemployment claim figures are also below the three-month moving average of 244,580. Despite a still-resilient labor market, investors largely expect the Federal Reserve to conclude its tightening cycle after hiking for the last time next week. The likelihood of a further rate hike in September is priced at 14%, and for November, a 30% chance, according to the latest CME Group Fedwatch data. Key Highlights From Last Week’s Jobless Claims The number of Americans registering for jobless claims in the week ending July 15 fell from 237,000 to 228,000, below the expected 242,000. The four-week moving average for jobless claims, which eliminates week-to-week variability, fell from 246,750 to 237,500. Continuing jobless claims for the week ended July 8 rose from the downwardly revised 1,721,000 to 1,754,000, above the expected 1,729,000. Notable weekly increases were reported in California, up 5,059 to 50,221, and Georgia, up 4,616 to 10,227. Market Reactions: Stocks Under Pressure, Dollar Gains Futures on the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq 100 Index were in the red Thursday as disappointing earnings reports from Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) dampened risk sentiment. Treasury yields rose, with the 10-year yield gaining 6 basis points to 3.81%, and the dollar gained ground against peers. The U.S. dollar index, which is tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), was 0.2% higher. Gold, as tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), ticked 0.1% lower to $1,976/oz.

2023-07-20,"Nasdaq Crashes As Netflix And Tesla Sink, Dow Roars And Dollar Rallies: What's Driving Markets Thursday?","Thursday was a volatile session for tech stocks as of midday trading in New York, with the Nasdaq 100 falling 1.5% as investors negatively react to second-quarter results from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The tech-heavy index is on track to suffer its worst trading session in more than a month. On the other hand, a solid earnings beat by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) lifted the blue-chip Dow Jones Index up 0.9%, putting it on course for its ninth consecutive session of gains, the longest winning run since September 2017. On the macro front, jobless claims came in below expectations last week, signaling a still-resilient job market. Speculators upped their bets for another rate hike after July, hedging from some unexpectedly hawkish remarks as the Federal Reserve meets next week. Both the dollar and short-term Treasury yields rallied. Cues From Thursday's Trading: The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was the weakest link on Thursday, down 1.5%. The S&P 500 contained losses, down 0.3%, while small caps in the Russell 2000 Index slipped 1%. The Dow was the outlier, up 0.8%, as health care, consumer staples and utilities outperformed other sectors.

Valuations are getting to lofty levels, especially given the hawkish Fed, and central banks around the globe in general, this time not only raising overnight rates but also running down their massive balance sheet, said fund manager Louis Navellier. But for now, until problems show up in earnings there are clearly more buyers than sellers and the question appears to be not whether to buy or not, but what to buy, he added.

The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY) plummeted 2.6%, the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) fell 1.5%, and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC) lost 1.4%, implying a red day for growth-related stocks.

2023-07-21,"Tech Holds Steady, Dow Eyes 10th Straight Session Of Gains: Friday's Market Drivers","U.S. stocks continued to display signs of divergence between the tech sector and the rest of the market on Friday, a trend that had already surfaced during Thursday’s session. Following a substantial sell-off in tech stocks yesterday, the Nasdaq remained relatively flat in midday trading, while the Dow saw a 0.2% increase, poised to conclude its 10th consecutive session of gains. This positive streak marks the first such occurrence since February 2017. Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) extended losses, falling 3% after suffering nearly a 9% decline in its worst session of the year on the previous day. As $2.3 trillion options expire Friday, traders adopted a cautious approach, particularly with the Nasdaq 100 reshuffle on the horizon. The reshuffle is expected to reduce the dominance of mega-cap companies and elevate the presence of smaller firms. Cues From Friday’s Trading: The S&P 500 gained 0.2% on the day, which would project the weekly gains to 0.9%. Blue chips in the Dow Index were 0.2% higher, up 2.4% for the week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was flat, down 0.5% for the week. Small caps in the Russell 2000 were also flat, but rose 1.9% this week.

He said the number would have been even lower but for a rising stock market. Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett has a slightly different take. A strong labor market, robust housing demand and resurgent business spending could help reignite U.S. economic growth next year, she said in a weekly report released earlier this week. With these factors at play, the economy may indeed re-accelerate. If it does, the stock market is likely to feature a new set of winners, with today's high-flying consumer-tech and media names giving way to leaders from other equity sectors, such as industrials, energy, housing, financials and health care, as well as commodities, she added. Thursday’s Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading on Thursday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.3% higher to $453, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.2% to $353 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was flat at $377.20, according to Benzinga Pro data. The best-performing sectors on Friday were the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU), up 1.7%, and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLV), up 1.1%. The laggard was the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC), down 1%. The futures market has priced in a 99.8% probability of a 25 basis-point Fed rate hike at the July meeting, as inflation still remains above the Fed's target rate.

2023-07-25,Will Jerome Powell Be Hawkish Or Dovish? How These 5 ETFs Could React To The Fed's Rate Decision Wednesday,"Investors are on standby for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting’s interest rate decision, due to be announced on Wednesday, July 26, at 2:00 p.m. ET. While the market has already fully priced in a 25-basis-point rate hike to a target range of 5.25%-5.5%, the Fed’s communications regarding future moves are expected to have a significant impact. A more hawkish attitude from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who may reaffirm the need for more hikes during his news conference, would likely catch markets off guard. A more dovish Fed stance, indicating that current interest rates are appropriately high and that future adjustments will be based on economic data, on the other hand, might solidify existing market expectations on the end of tightening in July. Here are the five major ETFs that are likely to see significant activity and shifts in reaction to the Fed interest rate decision: 1) Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP) The largest exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the performance of the U.S. dollar index (DXY) is likely to witness immediate reactions following the Fed meeting. A Federal Reserve leaning towards a more hawkish stance, maintaining a stringent approach against inflation despite recent declines and signaling a potential rate hike in September, is likely to significantly bolster the U.S. currency. The dollar bulls, on the other hand, would suffer a serious defeat if the Federal Reserve becomes more dovish and signals the end of policy tightening. The dollar is on course to post 6 consecutive positive sessions leading up to the Fed meeting, a stretch not seen since May 2022. The UUP ETF, on the other hand, is flat year to date and down 0.7% from a month ago. Also Read: You Have ‘Zero Chance’ Of Getting Hired If This Is On Your Resume, Says Former Google Recruiter Chart: Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF Price Action In 2023 2) iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSE:TLT) The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) is particularly sensitive to interest rate changes and the Federal Reserve’s policy stance. Because it tracks long-dated U.S. Treasury bonds with a remaining maturity of at least 20 years, small changes in yields have a substantial influence on the ETF’s value due to its elevated duration. A more hawkish Fed, implying a more aggressive approach to inflation and future rate hikes, poses troubles for long-term bonds. A more dovish Federal Reserve, which recognizes the risk of growth issues and minimizes inflation risks, tends to push down long-term bond yields, which boosts the value of the ETF. As of July 25, the TLT ETF is broadly flat year to date, with a more significant drop of roughly 5% in the previous three months, as long-term Treasury yields recently surged. Chart: iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Price Action In 2023 3) SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) Gold investors are very concerned about the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decisions and potential future actions. Interest rates and Treasury yields have a substantial impact on the value of precious metals. A hawkish Fed, which raises interest rates and provokes the surge in Treasury yields, puts downward pressure on gold prices, and vice versa. The GLD ETF has returned a positive 6.1% year to date. However, it has dropped 2% in the last three months as yields have recovered. 4) iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSE:IWF) Growth stocks have demonstrated greater sensitivity to Federal Reserve meetings. Stocks with high valuations and optimistic growth expectations could be in jeopardy if the Fed shows an aggressive posture towards inflation by enacting further interest rate hikes this year. Companies taking on riskier, potentially more lucrative long-term projects face higher financing costs as a result of higher interest rates. Growth stocks, on the other hand, may benefit from the expectation of future rate drops. Growth stocks have experienced a surge in 2023, climbing 32% so far this year, primarily due to the rally driven by advancements in AI and progress in sectors such as technology, communication services, and consumer discretionary. Chart: iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF Price Action in 2023 5) ProShares Trust VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (NYSE:VIXY) Volatility in the stock market, as measured by the VIX index, has experienced a significant decline since the last quarter of the previous year. The fear index has not only returned to pre-pandemic lows but has also endured nine negative months out of the last 10, currently maintaining a 5-month losing streak. The volatility index has seen a decrease of 59.2% since the start of the year. It’s natural to question whether the Federal Reserve has the ability to alter this trajectory. The answer largely depends on the actual impact of the upcoming event. The VIX may experience an uptick if the Fed signals intentions to hike interest rates more aggressively and speed up quantitative tightening, both of which could trigger market instability. As the Fed’s decision unfolds, investors are closely monitoring the VIXY ETF.

2023-07-26,"Fed Raises Interest Rates To 5.5%, The Highest Since Early 2001","The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 0.25% to 5.25%-5.5% as widely anticipated Wednesday, pushing borrowing costs to their highest level since February 2001. This move marks a resumption of rate hikes after a brief pause in June, bringing the cumulative increase to 5.25 percentage points since the start of the tightening cycle in March 2022. Chart: US Interest Rates Hit 5.5%, Highest Since February 2001 Key Takeaways From July FOMC Statement The July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement pointed to a continued expansion in economic activity, the resilience of the U.S. banking system and robust gains in the job market as factors underpinning the rate decision. Even though market expectations leaned toward the Fed ending its rate-hiking cycle after the July meeting, the central bank left the door open for future increases and did not commit to any specific course of action, instead basing its future decision on upcoming economic data. The committee said it will consider the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags by which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation and economic and financial developments when deciding the extent of additional policy actions needed to return inflation to target. The statement made no mention of recent improvements in inflation, with the consumer price index falling to 3% year-on-year in June, the lowest level since March 2021. The Fed reaffirmed its commitment to returning inflation to its 2% target. Market Reactions Ahead Of Powell’s Remarks Stocks were volatile after the FOMC statement was released and before Fed Chair Jerome Powell‘s press conference. The S&P 500 Index, as tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), ticked marginally higher before trimming gains. Large-cap tech stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index, as monitored by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), mirrored the move. The dollar slightly eased versus peers, with the U.S. dollar Index falling 0.15%. Gold, as closely tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), rose above $1,970/oz. Investors now anxiously await Powell’s press conference, due at 2:30 p.m. ET, to glean more information about the Federal Reserve’s stance on additional rate hikes in the remaining 2023 meetings.

2023-07-26,"Powell Keeps Interest Rate Hikes On The Table, Curbs Market Excitement: Tech Falls, Dollar Recovers","The Federal Reserve opted to raise interest rates by 25 basis points Wednesday, as the market expected, resuming tightening efforts after a brief hiatus in June. This moved raised the cost of borrowing in the United States to its highest level since February 2001, as part of the Fed’s efforts to bring inflation to a 2% objective. In his opening remarks, Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the extensive progress made, yet highlighted that the full impact of policy tightening is yet to be experienced. The Federal Reserve will maintain a data-dependent approach moving forward, he said. Powell expressed concern over the level of the core inflation rate in June, at 4.8%, significantly above the Fed’s mandate. Despite acknowledging a moderation in inflation since last year, Powell said the process to return inflation to the 2% target has a “long way to go.” Powell Holds Tight Stance Against Inflation In response to questions about potential additional rate hikes and the possibility of skipping a hike in September, Powell said the Federal Reserve will approach each meeting individually based on the upcoming data. While Powell acknowledged the positive aspects of the June CPI report, he emphasized the need to consider all upcoming economic data before making decisions about rate hikes in September. The Fed is taking a cautious and data-driven approach in its determination, he said. Before the September meeting, the Fed will take into account two additional CPI reports and two more job reports for its rate decision. Powell cited the positive impact of supply chain conditions on goods disinflation, but said core inflation remains elevated. He warned that the Fed should be prepared to raise rates further if deemed necessary. The Fed chair reiterated the need to hold policy at restrictive levels for some time and put rate cuts off the table for this year. Additionally, he stated that Fed staff no longer forecasts a recession and predicted that inflation won’t return to 2% until about 2025.

The S&P 500 Index has advanced by 27% over the past nine months, with gains accelerating considerably in the past six weeks. but these recent gains aren't all that different from prior bear market rallies, said Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett. “In fact, in all seven bear markets since 1960, stocks have come close to reaching their prior highs before falling to their ultimate lows for the cycle, which is why we think investors may want to remain cautious today,” she said. The analyst recommends that investors trim the gains achieved through passive exposure to U.S. stock indices and rebalancing toward value-style and growth at a reasonable price stocks.

Core inflation and job creation, however, are moving in the right direction. This, the analyst said, strengthens the case for a soft landing for the U.S. economy in 2023. “As a result, we continue to believe that the federal funds rate has peaked this year at 5.375% (the midpoint of the 5.25%-5.5% range announced on July 26), with the first cut coming in March 2024.” Friday’s Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading on Friday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 1% higher to $457, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.6% to $354.9 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 1.8% higher to $383, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-08-01,"Weak Seasonality Confronts AI Frenzy And No Landing, Tupperware New Favorite Meme Stock","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Resurgent Meme Crowd Please click here for a chart of Tupperware Brands Corp (NYSE:TUP). Note the following: The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of TUP is being used to illustrate the point. As discussed in yesterday’s Morning Capsule and many other prior capsules, prudent inventors track sentiment. Sentiment plays a major part in the moves in the stock market. As an example, the stock market rally in 2023 is mostly based on positive sentiment driven by the AI frenzy, resulting in PE expansion. The meme crowd was surging during the pandemic. Theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and video game retailer GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) were top meme crowd favorites. The meme crowd ran up GME from about $1 to over $120 (outside regular trading hours), and now the stock has fallen back to $22. The meme crowd also ran up AMC from the $2 range to $72, and now the stock has fallen back to under $5. As meme mania waned, meme stocks pulled back, causing many in the meme crowd to completely blow their accounts, while others lost over 90%. An indication of sentiment approaching the extreme once again is the resurgence of the meme crowd. Tupperware has become the latest meme crowd favorite. The chart shows the move in TUP stock from $0.61 to $5.29 in a matter of days. It is not that Tupperware all of a sudden discovered a cure for cancer or gave us any other positive news. It is simply moving up on buying by the meme crowd and the resulting short squeeze. The initial trigger for the meme crowd buying TUP stock was a regulatory filing by Tupperware that it had identified multiple misstatements in its financial reports and material weaknesses in internal controls. Tupperware also said that it would have inadequate liquidity to fund its operations and might not be able to make principal and interest payments due on a loan. The first ten days of August are a seasonally weak period. The weak seasonality will confront the AI frenzy, FOMO, and buying on consensus of no landing. Keep in mind that the momo crowd and meme crowd are oblivious as their belief that stocks are going to surge is getting stronger. Two pieces of economic data ahead may be market moving: July ISM Manufacturing Index will be released at 10am ET. The consensus is 46.8. A number less than 50 is considered economic contraction. This number is especially important because the consensus in the stock market now is of no landing. Investors have been focused on the data that supports no landing and have been ignoring the data that shows there is still a fair probability of a recession. How long can this continue? In The Arora Report analysis, based on history this can continue until after the economy is in a recession. History tells us that investors become very optimistic before a recession. A good example is 2007. In October 2007, The Arora Report called for an extremely high probability of a recession and a stock market crash. The protection band was at 100% protection level. The call was to buy inverse ETFs and aggressively short the market for those who could short. The consensus was of no recession and new highs in the stock market. After The Arora Report call in October 2007, the stock market continued to go higher until, in 2008, the great financial recession occurred and S&P 500 lost about half of its value. Investors who were invested in the wrong sectors such as housing, savings and loans, and speculative stocks, lost 80% - 90% of their portfolios. With the proper use of inverse ETFs, The Arora Report generated a positive return of 40% during the stock market crash and a return over 80% for those who could short. JOLTS job openings report will also be reported at 10am ET. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Blind Money Blind money is the money that flows into Wall Street on the first two days of the month without any analysis and irrespective of stock market conditions. Blind money is typically invested in the afternoons. Wall Street professionals front run the blind money by buying in the morning and selling to blind money at inflated prices in the afternoon. However, in the early trade today, the stock market is under pressure due to the start of the weak seasonality period. Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is lightly selling stocks in the early trade. Gold The momo crowd is selling gold in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). Oil The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see oil ratings. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin to United States Dollar (CRYPTO: BTC) has fallen below $29,000. Markets Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is negative. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒.

You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

2023-08-01,"Stocks Dip, Bond Yields Rise And Dollar Gains As Investors Turn Cautious: What's Driving Markets Tuesday","Risk appetite experienced a setback in the first session of August, following the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 both closing their fifth consecutive month of gains in July. Disappointing manufacturing activity data, marking the ninth straight month of contraction, and mixed corporate earnings likely weighed on the sentiment. Additionally, signs of a softening labor market were evident as the number of job openings fell, reaching a two-year low in June.

2023-08-01,Hot On The Market: 5 ETFs In The Spotlight As Key Jobs Data Unfolds This Week,"The July labor market report takes center stage this week. Investors and markets brace for significant economic releases that will influence future Federal Reserve rate decisions. Tuesday provided a glimpse at a decrease in the number of job vacancies throughout June. Wednesday’s ADP employment change will serve as a more substantial preview of the highly anticipated jobs report on Friday. Investors estimate 190,000 monthly job creations in the private sector, according to ADP. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects some 200,000 new non-farm payrolls. If economists’ forecasts align with the data, it would result in the lowest ADP employment growth since March 2023, declining by over 307,000 compared to the previous month’s increase. For non-farm payrolls, it would be the lowest reading since December 2020 once again. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.6%, near a multi-decade low, and wage growth is predicted to ease by 0.2 percentage points to 4.2% year-on-year. Read more: September Rate Pause Odds Soar As Wall Street Economists Forecast Weaker Outlook Potential Jobs Data Surprises May Amplify Volatility in These 5 ETFs The July labor market data will have an impact on market expectations regarding Federal Reserve rate hikes. Stronger-than-expected job growth combined with rising wages may lead investors to anticipate potential rate hikes in September. Conversely, lower-than-expected data could solidify the current solid expectations for a pause in rate increases. Currently, investors are assigning an 82% probability of unchanged rates in September, according to Fed futures prices. The following five ETFs listed below could experience increased volatility if the labor market data surprises economists’ estimates. iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT)Interest rate expectations influence long-dated Treasury bonds. A stronger-than-expected July job report could potentially exert a negative impact on the TLT ETF. Bond prices will decrease, as investors raise their Fed hike expectations. A weaker-than-expected job report could have the opposite effect: an increase in bond prices and a decline in yields. Invesco DB USD Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP)The value of the U.S. dollar is closely tied to the interest rates set by the Fed. A growing economy, with a healthy job market and accelerating inflation, usually supports the dollar. Investors expect a rising interest-rate environment. This can make dollar investments more attractive, thereby increasing demand for the currency. Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ)Tech stocks are highly sensitive to changes in the labor market and inflation. This is primarily due to the impact of interest rates on the sector’s growth trajectory. Tech stocks prosper in a “not too cold, not too hot” labor market where employment and wage growth are balanced. This scenario may benefit the Nasdaq 100 index because it minimizes economic uncertainty and concerns about prospective interest rate hike. iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) A stronger job market is good news for small-cap stocks. It indicates a healthy economy with higher consumer confidence and increased demand for goods and services, benefiting these companies. Conversely, softening labor conditions can be indicative of a growth slowdown. This can negatively impact small-cap stocks as they may face challenges with reduced consumer spending and declining sales. SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD)Gold’s value is susceptible to Fed interest rate rises, falling during periods of strong economic growth and rising interest rates. When the dread of a recession grows, gold becomes a sought-after safe haven, offering a buffer against economic instability. A stronger job market is often regarded as an anti-recession hint. It tempers positive price movements in gold. A negative job report, on the other hand, is typically regarded as a favorable event for gold.

2023-08-02,"Nasdaq Plunges, VIX Spikes As US Credit Downgrade Sparks Rush To Cash: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?","Wednesday is shaping up to become one of the most negative trading sessions of the year, with a sharp spike in the VIX, the market’s fear gauge, rising by 16% as of midday New York trading, the largest daily increase since March 9 when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed. Wall Street was rattled by Fitch’s downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating by one notch to AA+, aligning with S&P’s assessment. Better-than-expected ADP employment report data for July failed to prevent a widespread sell-off affecting stocks, bonds, and commodities, with the only exception provided by the dollar’s performance in the foreign exchange market, signaling a growing demand for liquid assets. Cues From Wednesday's Trading: Major indices faced a significant tumble, with tech stocks showing the most weakness. The Nasdaq 100 experienced a notable 2.4% decline, on track for its largest daily drop in 2023. Small caps in the Russell 2000 index fell by 1.8%, while the S&P 500 shed 1.4%. The Dow lost 240 points, down 0.7% for the session. US Index Performance On Wednesday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq 100 -2.42% 15,343.55 S&P 500 Index -1.43% 4,518.73 Dow Industrials -0.7% 35,396.17 Russell 2,000 -1.76% 1,959.15 Analyst Color: The downgrade, according to Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at RBC BlueBay Asset Management LLP, is a caution for the continued high issuance of U.S. Treasuries, which might have a rippling impact on global markets and a shift in the yield curve. He also stated that investors have lately begun to accept the Goldilocks story, but warned that pricing for perfection may put investors in danger of a slump. Wednesday’s Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading on Wednesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 1.3% lower to $450, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) fell 0.7% to $354 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 2.4% lower to $373, according to Benzinga Pro data.

Defensive sectors surged with the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLV), Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU) and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP), up 0.7%, 0.9% and 0.5%, respectively. Latest Economic Data: The ADP released its private employment report for July showing a slowdown in the pace of job gains from 455,000 to 324,000, but still well above the expected 189,000.

2023-08-02,U.S. Credit Rating Downgraded – Momo Crowd Aggressively Buys The Dip,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. U.S. Credit Downgraded Please click here for a chart SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX). Note the following: The chart shows that the stock market is consolidating in no man’s land. The chart shows that the stock market is very stretched way above the 200 day moving average. The RSI pattern shown on the chart indicates that the stock market can go either way. The Arora Report had previously shared with you in advance that Fitch was warning it might downgrade the U.S. credit rating. Fitch has downgraded the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+. Fitch gives the following three reasons: Fiscal deterioration is anticipated to continue. The general government debt burden is too high and continues to grow. Compared to AAA peers, there is an erosion of governance in the U.S. The chart shows that the downgrade of the U.S. credit has not had much impact on the stock market in the early trade. In The Arora Report analysis, the Fitch downgrade is justified, and the three reasons Fitch gave are correct. In history, there has only been one other downgrade of U.S. credit. This was in 2011 by S&P. The downgrade of U.S. credit resonated across the globe, but not in the U.S. On the downgrade, stocks fell in Japan by 2.3%, in Hong Kong by 2.5%, South Korea by 1.9%, in Australia by 1.2%, and in India by 1.0%. Stocks in Europe opened lower, but as investors saw aggressive buying coming in U.S. stock futures, investors started buying the dip in European stocks. Stocks in Germany are down 0.8%, in the U.K. by 1.0%, in France by 0.6%, in Italy by 0.8%, and in Spain by 1.2%. The momo crowd in the U.S. aggressively bought the shallow dip in stocks on the downgrade. The momo guru narrative is that neither the Fitch downgrade nor the rising U.S. national debt matters to investors because there is upward momentum in the stock market. In our over 40 years in the markets, we have repeatedly seen that upwards momentum can quickly disappear. Until upward momentum disappears, our job as investors is to acknowledge the reality that the momo crowd controls the market and the momo crowd does not care about the debt. In The Arora Report analysis, here is an important piece of new data that prudent investors should pay attention to. The U.S. Treasury Department has announced that it plans to borrow about $1T in the third quarter. This is the largest amount ever to be borrowed by the U.S. in any third quarter. More importantly, the amount to be borrowed is about $200B more than the prior estimates. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. ADP Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP) is the largest private payroll processor in the country. ADP uses its data to give a glimpse of the jobs picture before the official jobs report that will be released Friday at 8:30am ET. ADP data shows that the jobs picture continues to be very strong. ADP employment change came at 324K vs. 185K consensus. ADP data runs counter to the momo gurus’ narrative that the Fed will start cutting rates as early as September. Momo gurus have used this narrative, in part, to successfully run up the stock market. Blind Money Blind money is the money that flows into Wall Street on the first two days of the month without any analysis and irrespective of stock market conditions. Blind money is typically invested in the afternoons. Wall Street professionals front run the blind money by buying in the morning and selling to blind money at inflated prices in the afternoon. Blind money is helping cushion the drop in the stock market on the credit downgrade. Magnificent Seven Since the AI frenzy driven rally has been led by the magnificent seven stocks, it is important for investors to pay attention to the magnificent seven stocks. The magnificent seven stocks are Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Today, it is especially important to see how the magnificent seven stocks react to the U.S. downgrade. In the early trade, money is flowing out of Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla. Money flows are especially negative in TSLA in the early trade. In the early trade, money flows are positive in Microsoft and Meta. Apple and Amazon will report earnings tomorrow after the market close. Money flows in Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) started the day out by being very negative, but they have turned positive as of this writing. AMD Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is not one of the magnificent seven stocks, but it is an important stock because AMD has the next best GPUs after Nvidia. GPUs are essential for the large language model generative AI. ChatGPT was trained on 10,000 Nvidia GPUs. We wrote yesterday after AMD earnings: If it was not for AI, AMD stock would have experienced a significant drop because the numbers are below whisper numbers and the stock had run up going into earnings. The seven different mentions of AI in the earnings is helping the stock move higher. The AMD conference call was very positive and emphasized that AMD is achieving strong engagement with potential customers on its artificial intelligence products. AMD admitted that engagement does not mean revenues. In The Arora Report analysis, an important point that no one is talking about is that AI products from AMD will dilute its margins. Here is the key question for investors: Will the market care about lower margins in view of the expensive valuation of the stock, or will investors look past negatives in excitement over AI? Those who want in-depth knowledge on AMD, listen to the podcast titled “Gaining An Edge: Semiconductors Are The Lifeblood Of AI.” Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks The momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. Gold Gold is seeing buying on the U.S. credit rating downgrade. In The Arora Report analysis, buying in gold is nowhere near as strong as would have been expected on the U.S. downgrade. The reason is the long term interest rates are rising, and gold moves inverse to interest rates in the short term. The momo crowd is buying gold in the early trade. Smart money is buying gold in the early trade. For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). Oil The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see oil ratings. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin to United States Dollar (CRYPTO: BTC) is seeing buying on the U.S. credit downgrade. Markets Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is negative. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial.

2023-08-02,"Deja Vu: After Fitch's Cut To US Credit Rating, A Look At The Market Fallout From S&P's 2011 Downgrade","The recent downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating from AAA to AA+ by Fitch Ratings has brought back memories of a similar event occurred exactly 12 years ago. On Aug. 6, 2011, S&P made history by downgrading the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+ for the first time since 1941. S&P downgraded the nation’s credit rating in August 2011 after Washington avoided a default by temporarily increasing the debt ceiling, just as it did again in June of this year. Increased political polarization and a lack of action to improve the country’s financial situation led to this decision. How Did Markets React To 2011 Sovereign Credit Rating Downgrade? The U.S. credit downgrade was not the only negative news impacting the markets back then. The eurozone was in the clutches of a sovereign debt crisis, with worries of PIGS — an abbreviation for Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain — defaults. As soon as the markets reopened on Monday, Aug. 8 following the weekend break, global stocks sold off. The sharp decline lasted through August and September.S&P 500 index: The index of the 500 largest US corporations, also tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), declined by 80 points or 6.7% on the first day of trading following the downgrade. For the whole month, the S&P fell 5.7%, then dropped 7.3% in September 2011 before rebounding by 10.7% in October. Dow Jones Industrial Average: The Dow Jones Industrial Average, tracking blue-chip stocks, experienced a plummet of 635 points or 5.6% on the Monday following the S&P downgrade. Subsequently, the Dow, as tracked by the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA), dropped 4.5% in August and 6.2% in September before rebounding by 9.5% in October. Nasdaq 100 index: The index of technology firms fell 6.2% on the day following the U.S. rating downgrade. The tech-heavy index monitored by the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) showed milder losses of 5.2% for the whole month of August. The index fell 4.5% in September before rising 10.3% in October. VIX index: The “fear gauge” tracking market volatility skyrocketed 50% on Aug. 8, 2011. The CBOE volatility index rose by 25% for the whole month of August and then extended the gains by 35% in September 2011. US Treasuries: Despite the downgrade, sovereign bonds rallied, as the risk-off environment prompted a flight to safety. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note tumbled by 78 basis points in August and by an additional 18 basis points in September, declining by a cumulative full percentage point in two months. In price terms, U.S. 10-year Treasuries gained 3.5% in August 2011. US Dollar: The U.S. Dollar index (DXY), closely tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP) was only marginally higher (0.3%) in August 2011, but rallied 6% in September. Gold: The precious metal, as tracked by the SPDR Gold ETF Trust (NYSE:GLD) rallied 3.2% Aug. 8, 2011, to 12% for the month, outperforming other major asset classes. Yet he rally was short-lived, as gold erased all its gains in September, declining by 11%.

2023-08-02,"SPY, QQQ, And IWM: The 3 Tickers To Short If The Market Declines After The Fitch Downgrade. How Traders Can Profit From The Fitch Downgrade Of US Bonds.","In 2011, when Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' credit rating from AAA to AA+, the stock market reacted negatively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by over 200 points on the day of the downgrade, and the S&P 500 fell by over 10% in the following month. This was a significant event, as it reflected a loss of confidence in the United States' ability to manage its finances. However, it also created opportunities for traders who were prepared. Here are some strategies that traders could use to profit from the news: Trading SPY (NYSE:SPY), QQQ (NASDAQ:QQQ), and IWM (NYSE:IWM) are an easy way to trade the market lower. Sell short: Traders who believed that the downgrade would lead to a decline in stock prices could sell short. This involves borrowing shares of a stock and then selling them immediately, with the intention of buying them back later at a lower price. Buy puts: Traders could also buy puts, which are options that give the holder the right to sell a stock at a certain price on or before a certain date. If the stock price falls below the strike price of the put, the trader can exercise the option and sell the stock at the strike price, locking in a profit. Trade volatility: The downgrade is likely to increase volatility in the stock market. Traders who can trade volatility can profit from the increased volatility. These Popular Stock Tickers did poorly in 2011 after the downgrade in bonds and may have a repeat performance today. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell by over 10% on the day of the downgrade. Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock fell by over 8% on the day of the downgrade. JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) stock fell by over 7% on the day of the downgrade. Wells Fargo's (NYSE:WFC) stock fell by over 6% on the day of the downgrade. Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock fell by over 5% on the day of the downgrade. These stocks were all considered to be relatively safe investments, so their declines were a sign that investors were becoming more cautious. Tickers to Profit From Today. Here are some tickers that traders could profit from today from the same news: The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) is a popular way to invest in long-term US Treasury bonds. If investors become more risk-averse, they may be more likely to buy TLT, which could lead to higher prices. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) is a popular way to invest in gold. Gold is often seen as a safe haven asset, so if investors become more worried about the US economy, they may be more likely to buy GLD, which could lead to higher prices. VIX: The VIX is a measure of implied volatility in the S&P 500. If the downgrade leads to increased volatility in the stock market, the VIX could rise, which could lead to profits for traders who are short volatility.

2023-08-03,Unemployment Claims Tick Higher Ahead Of Friday's Jobs Report: Treasury Yields Continue To Rise,"The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits slightly increased last week, reaching 227,000, aligning with economist predictions and indicating the U.S. labor market’s continued resilience. The Department of Labor’s latest report Thursday showed a marginal uptick of 6,000 claims from the previous week’s 221,000 filings, meeting expectations. The update on jobless claims after came after ADP employment data for July revealed a substantial rise of 324,000 jobs, surpassing the anticipated 189,000, setting an optimistic tone ahead of the crucial jobs report on Friday. Looking ahead, the consensus economists projections call for a slight dip in non-farm payrolls, from 209,000 in June to 200,000 in July. The unemployment rate is expected to remain stable at 3.6%, while wage growth is likely to ease slightly from 4.4% to 4.2%. Key Highlights From Last Week's Jobless Claims The number of Americans registering for jobless claims in the week ending July 29 rose from 221,000 to 227,000, as expected. The four-week moving average, which eliminates week-to-week variability, came in at 1,712,250, marking a decrease of 4,500 from the previous week’s revised average. Continuing jobless claims for the week ended July 22 rose from the revised 1,679,000 to 1,700,000, matching expectations. Notable weekly increases were reported in Missouri, up 2,458 to 5,028. Noteworthy declines were found in California, down 2,386 to 41,341, and Ohio, down 2,958 to 18,500.

2023-08-03,Investors Pin Hopes On Apple And Amazon Stoking AI Frenzy,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Hopes On Earnings Please click here for a chart of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Note the following: The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AAPL stock is being used to illustrate the point. After the U.S. credit downgrade, investors are pinning hopes on Apple and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) earnings to drive the stock market higher by stoking AI frenzy. AAPL is the largest and most popular stock. Many investors believe that AAPL stock is as safe as a money market fund, and they use it similar to a money market fund. AAPL carries very heavy weight in the indexes and as such, AAPL stock is a big driving force behind the stock market. The chart shows when AAPL stock dipped in the Arora buy zone, giving an opportunity to those who were not already in AAPL stock to buy AAPL. The chart also illustrates the power of Arora buy zones. A buy zone is a technique used by billionaires and hedge funds. Please see the Trade Management Guidelines to learn more. The chart shows the upward sloping trendline that has held since AAPL stock dipped in the Arora buy zone. The chart shows when Silicon Valley Bank failed. To prevent more bank failures, the Fed injected a massive amount of liquidity in the system. Some of the liquidity injected by the Fed went into AAPL stock, driving it higher. The chart shows RSI divergence. In plain English, this means that RSI went lower as the stock price went higher. From a technical perspective, this is a warning signal ahead of earnings. Prudent investors will be carefully watching if the trendline holds after the earnings. Bullish investors are expecting AAPL stock to jump to about $210 after earnings. These investors are betting that AAPL will mention AI in its earnings release and subsequently in its earnings call, driving the stock higher. From a fundamental perspective, the rise shown in AAPL stock on the chart has occurred with deteriorating earnings. If the consensus is correct, AAPL is on track for three quarters in a row of declining revenues. The move up in AAPL stock is driven by PE expansion driven by positive investor sentiment towards AAPL. A year ago, AAPL was trading at a PE of 22. Now, it is trading at a PE of 33. A year ago, AAPL was trading at price/sales of 5.87. Now, AAPL is trading at price/sales of 8.15. We understand investors love AAPL. Especially for newer members, before sending us a negative email for pointing out that AAPL stock is very expensive, keep in mind that AAPL stock is long from $4.68 in the ZYX Buy Model Portfolio by The Arora Report. Due to large gains, AAPL stock has a very heavy weight in the portfolios of most long term members of The Arora Report. Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM), a major supplier of technology to all smart phones including Apple, stated on its conference call that it is seeing significant weakness in phone sales in China. The comment is mostly directed at Android phones. If Android phone sales are so weak, is the iPhone immune? Earnings from AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), and T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS) show that there is weakness in phone sales. However, it is not known if that weakness is only in Android phones. In addition to Apple, Amazon will be reporting earnings after the close. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Jobless Claims Initial jobless claims came at 227K vs. 225K consensus. This is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in the highly successful adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in 10 categories. In plain English, adaptive means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then they stop working when market conditions change. The adaptiveness of the ZYX Asset Allocation Model is, in part, responsible for the success of The Arora Report. Please click here to see how adaptiveness is achieved. Labor Costs Unit labor costs came at 1.6% vs. 2.7% consensus. Q2 productivity came at 3.7% vs. 1.7% consensus. India The economy in India continues to stay strong. July services PMI came at 62.3 vs. 58.0 consensus. Magnificent Seven In spite of bullishness about Apple and Amazon earnings, money flows are negative in the early trade in Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA). Since the AI frenzy driven rally has been led by the magnificent seven stocks, it is important for investors to pay attention to the magnificent seven stocks. Today, it is especially important to see how the magnificent seven stocks behave in view of Apple and Amazon earnings. Money flows in the early trade in Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ), and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) are negative. Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. Gold The momo crowd is like a yoyo in gold in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). Oil The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see oil ratings. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (NYSE:USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is range bound. Markets Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is negative but expect the momo crowd to try to run up the market by aggressively buying Apple and Amazon ahead of earnings. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls. The Arora Report correctly called the 2008 financial crash, the start of a mega bull market in 2009, the COVID crash, the post-COVID bull market, and the 2022 bear market.

2023-08-03,"Stocks Mitigate Losses Ahead Of Apple, Amazon Earnings; Treasury Yields Rocket On Debt Frenzy: Thursday's Market Drivers","Stocks are attempting to stabilize after a volatile session on Wednesday, with the tech sector showing slight signs of recovery while awaiting the quarterly earnings reports of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), scheduled to be released after Thursday’s closing bell. Meanwhile, long-term Treasury yields continue to rise, causing a sharp steepening of the yield curve. The 30-year Treasury yield has surged by 12 basis points to 4.3%, while the 10-year yield has climbed by 10 basis points to 4.18%, both reaching their highest levels since November 2022. The bond market has been impacted by Fitch’s U.S. ratings downgrade and announcements of larger-than-expected issuances for the current month, which have put pressure on bond yields. Looking ahead, Friday will bring the highly anticipated release of July’s labor market data, with economists predicting a small decline in non-farm payrolls by 9,000 to 200,000, an unchanged jobless rate of 3.6%, and a cooling growth in hourly wages at 4.2% year-on-year. Cues From Thursday's Trading: The S&P 500 was broadly unchanged, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 flipped to gains, up 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 0.1% higher, while small caps in the Russell 2000 index were flat. US Index Performance On Thursday Index Performance (+/-)ValueNasdaq 100+0.4%15,437.33S&P 500-0.04%4,520.19Dow Industrials0.12%35,330.82Russell 20000.4%1,964.23 Analyst Color: The odds are increasing that stocks could finally take some type of break, said Carson Group's Ryan Detrick. The analyst sees a modest pullback of approximately 5% to be “perfectly normal,” given the S&P 500 closed higher for five consecutive months. August, the analyst noted, is a poor performer and trailed behind only September and December in the last 10 years. Historically, when the S&P 500 Index was up more than 17.5% for the year ahead of August, the month has mostly seen negative returns, Detrick added. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett said the Fed may not begin to cut rates any time soon, as the core inflation is still too hot for its liking. “Consider rebalancing toward value-style equities or those with ‘growth at a reasonable price’ attributes,” she suggested. Thursday’s Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading on Thursday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.1% lower to $449.79, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) held steady at to $352.68 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 0.1% higher to $374, according to Benzinga Pro data. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) rallied 1.7% outperforming all other S&P 500’s sectors. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) was the laggard, down 2.3%, followed by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU), down 1.9%. Latest Economic Data: The Services PMI measured by S&P Global was revised by 0.1% lower to 52.30 points in July, indicating a slowdown from the 54.40 points recorded in June 2023. The ISM Services PMI declined from 53.9 in June to 52.7 in July, falling below the expected 53. The Department of Labor's latest report on jobless claims showed a marginal uptick of 6,000 from the previous week's 221,000 filings, meeting expectations.

2023-08-04,Apple On Track For The Worst Revenue Decline Streak In Two Decades And Interest Rates Rise - Momo Crowd Does Not Care,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Long Yields Rise Please click here for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT). Note the following: The chart shows that long bonds are falling because yields on long bonds are rising. Bonds trade inverse to the yield. The trendline on the chart shows that TLT had been making lower highs prior to the sudden drop. The chart shows that TLT has now fallen below the prior support zone, which has now become the resistance zone. The chart shows the next support zone. RSI on the chart shows that TLT is way oversold. An oversold condition can lead to a quick bounce, but the bounce may not be sustainable in view of the huge supply of Treasury bonds. As a member of The Arora Report, you knew in advance that this was likely to happen due to increased borrowing by the U.S. We previously wrote: In The Arora Report analysis, here is an important piece of new data that prudent investors should pay attention to. The U.S. Treasury Department has announced that it plans to borrow about $1T in the third quarter. This is the largest amount ever to be borrowed by the U.S. in any third quarter. More importantly, the amount to be borrowed is about $200B more than the prior estimates. Along with the rise in yields on U.S. government bonds, yields on government bonds across the globe are rising. Traditionally when yields rise, stocks fall. The reason is that stocks compete with bonds. When yields rise, bonds become more attractive. Since technology stocks tend to be long duration stocks, historically, they are impacted negatively more than other stocks by rising yields. To develop an in-depth understanding of how it all works, listen to the podcast titled “Be Careful With Popular Long Duration Stocks.” In addition to this podcast, there are several other podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club that give you in-depth knowledge on the subject. Rising yields were responsible for the significant drop in technology stocks and the bear market in 2022. In 2023, investor exuberance over AI became so great that investors stopped caring about the yields. As a result, the historical relationship between stocks and bonds broke. Will the historical relationship reassert itself? Here are the key points from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings: Apple earnings were slightly below the consensus and significantly below the whisper numbers. Apple revenues declined for the third quarter in a row. Apple is on track for declining revenues in this quarter. This will make the worst revenue decline streak for Apple in two decades. iPhone sales declined. On the positive side, service revenues reached an all time high of $21B. Apple now has one billion customers for its services. Apple sales in India hit a record. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) earnings were significantly better than consensus and slightly better than the whisper numbers. Both Apple and Amazon hyped AI in their conference calls. However, considering the huge investment AI needs, neither company seems to have a clear map to profit from AI. In The Arora Report analysis, right now investors are not looking ahead, and the AI frenzy is so hyped up that investors don't even ask how these companies will profit from AI. In due course, this will change. Stock futures fell after the release of Apple earnings along with AAPL stock. Subsequently, the People's Bank of China said that it would increase funding support for the private sector. The statement from China, not only caused a rally in Chinese stocks, it caused a significant rally in U.S. stock futures. Stock futures started pulling back in anticipation of the jobs report and continue to slightly pullback after the jobs report. The jobs report is mixed. Here are the details: Non-farm private payrolls came at 172K vs. 175K consensus. Headline non-farm payrolls came at 187K vs. 200K consensus. Hourly earnings came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus. Average work week came at 34.3 vs. 34.4 consensus. The foregoing illustrates the advantage of an adaptive model that changes itself with market conditions. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then they stop working when market conditions change. The highly successful ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories and a long track record of hundreds of accurate calls in both bull and bear markets is an adaptive model. Here are two examples to consider: In the past, there was a time when Apple revenues declined for one quarter and the stock was cut in half. Now, Apple is on track for declining revenues for four quarters in a row and Apple stock is up 52% this year. This is where buy zones from The Arora Report absolutely shine. The chart shows the Arora buy zone, which allowed members of The Arora Report to buy Apple near the lows and experience large gains. Last year, technology stocks were hit hard because interest rates were rising. This year, nobody cares. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. Magnificent Seven Money Flows Money flows in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon, and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) are positive in the earning trade. Money flows in Apple, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are negative in the early trade. Money flows in Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) are mixed. Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. Gold The momo crowd is buying gold in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). Oil The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see oil ratings. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (ASCA: USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is range bound. Markets Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is neutral. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒.

2023-08-07,"Largest Ever Chinese Russian Warship Group Approached Alaska, Earnings Drop, Meme Stocks Resurgent","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Earnings Drop Please click here for a chart of the trucking firm Yellow Corporation (NASDAQ:YELL). YELL is the latest meme stock. Note the following: The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of YELL is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows when it became clear that the bankruptcy of Yellow was imminent. To most investors, bankruptcy is not good news, but the meme crowd is different. The chart shows that the meme crowd aggressively bought YELL stock on the bankruptcy news. The chart shows that the meme crowd ran up YELL stock by 861% in three days. The news this morning is that Yellow has filed for bankruptcy. How is the meme crowd responding to the news? They are urging the crowd to double down and buy more YELL stock aggressively. In The Arora Report analysis, without the meme crowd activity, YELL stock is worthless. It is very important right now for investors to track the sentiment. The reason is that the stock market has risen on sentiment driven by the AI frenzy and Bidenomics while earnings have declined. An important indication of sentiment is the activity of the meme crowd. The meme crowd is the crowd that copies trades based on social media and believes that their collective buying can run up the stocks. The meme crowd often becomes resurgent when sentiment becomes very positive. The meme crowd was surging during the pandemic. Theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) and video game retailer GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) were top meme crowd favorites. The meme crowd ran up GME from about $1 to over $120 (outside regular trading hours), and now the stock has fallen back to $21. The meme crowd also ran up AMC from the $2 range to $72, and now the stock has fallen back to under $5. We previously shared with you: As discussed in yesterday’s Morning Capsule and many other prior capsules, prudent inventors track sentiment. Sentiment plays a major part in the moves in the stock market. As an example, the stock market rally in 2023 is mostly based on positive sentiment driven by the AI frenzy, resulting in PE expansion. The Arora Report members gain an edge with our proprietary sentiment indicator that is shared daily in the Afternoon Capsule. Companies are playing well the age old game of trying to run up their stocks. Companies guided analysts to lower their earnings projections to such an extent that the companies knew they would be able to beat the lower projections. As is the pattern, Wall Street analysts obliged and lowered their estimates. So far, 422 of the 500 S&P 500 companies have reported their earnings. 79% of the 422 companies have beaten the lower estimates. It is not different than most quarters when the vast majority of the companies beat the estimates that they themselves had deliberately guided analysts to lower. Nobody is talking about the simple fact that earnings this quarter are down by 5.2% over the same quarter last year. Even though earnings are down compared to the same quarter last year, the stock market is significantly higher. The mantra of the perma bulls is that this is the trough quarter of earnings. Of course, perma bulls make this announcement every quarter in an attempt to run up the stock market. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. Audacious Move Given the backdrop of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the potential Chinese invasion of Taiwan, China and Russia joined together to make an audacious move. The largest ever warship group from the Chinese and Russian navies approached Alaska in a provocative move. To counter Chinese and Russian moves, the U.S. sent four navy warships to the same waters. This incident is a further reaffirmation that our prior major call is correct. The major call is that the four megatrends that drove the 40 year secular bull market from 1982 to 2022 have ended. One of the megatrends that has ended is lower defense spending, which helped stock markets throughout the world. Going forward, the highest probability is of cyclical bull markets and cyclical bear markets. For those who were not able to attend the event and want to understand in-depth as to how to proceed going forward, a recording of the event is available in Arora Ambassador Club.

This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

2023-08-08,"Bank Downgrades Trigger Stock Sell-Off; Treasuries, Dollar Rally Amid Safe-Haven Demand: What's Driving Markets Tuesday?","Tuesday marked a risk-off session, dominated by concerns surrounding U.S. banks, which were hit by a wave of downgrades from Moody’s. The credit ratings of 10 small and medium-sized institutions were lowered by a notch, and the rating agency issued a warning of potential downgrades for an additional six major U.S. banks. The VIX jumped 10%, to its highest since late May, with all major indices and sectors trading in the red with the sole exception of health care. Macro themes are overtaking the market, overshadowing for the moment the positive earnings season that continues for corporations. The sell-off did not spare Europe after the Italian government announced a surprise tax on banks’ windfall profits. Investors flocked to safe-haven assets, with Treasuries rallying and the dollar advancing on the FX market. Cues From Tuesday's Trading: The S&P 500 fell nearly 1%, briefly hitting the lowest level since June 12. The Dow slipped by 270 points or 0.8%. Both the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 and the Russell 2000 tumbled 1.4%.

The analysts, however, acknowledged the economy's impressive resilience. “The July jobs report fits the soft landing narrative, though a mild and short-lived recession beginning within the next six to nine months still appears more likely than not,” they said. Factoring in an “increasingly likely” Fed pause in September, the analysts said they recommended a “neutral tactical allocation to equities, with a modest overweight to fixed income funded from cash.” LPL favors developed international equities over emerging markets and large caps over small caps, and maintained the industrials sector as its top overall sector pick. Tuesday’s Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading on Tuesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.9% lower to $446.8, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) fell 0.8% to $351.90 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 1.4% higher to $370, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The worst performers were the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) and the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF), both down by 1.4%. Latest Economic Data: Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, who is also a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, delivered dovish remarks. The policymaker said the Federal Reserve could adopt a patient approach and maintain interest rates at their current levels, barring alarming new data by mid-September. Harker’s projections suggest the core PCE could decline to slightly under 4% by the conclusion of 2023, dipping below 3% in 2024 and aligning with the 2% target in 2025. He indicated a potential scenario where rate cuts might commence sometime next year. See also: Best Futures Brokers Stocks In Focus: Eli Lilly & Co.

2023-08-08,"Apple At Critical Junction For Entire Stock Market, Moody's Downgrades Banks Chinese Exports Fall, Raise Hedges","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. A Critical Junction Please click here for a chart of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Note the following: The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AAPL is being used to illustrate the point. Apple stock is the largest stock in the market, has heavy weight in indexes, and is the most beloved stock perceived by many as a safe stock. For this reason, whatever happens to Apple stock has a disproportionate impact on the entire stock market. The chart shows the Arora buy zone that helped newer members of The Arora Report buy AAPL near the recent lows resulting in large profits. Long time members are holding AAPL from $4.68. Buy zones are a billionaire and hedge fund technique that can significantly increase profits and lower risks. To learn about buy zones and more billionaire techniques, see Trade Management Guidelines from The Arora Report. The chart shows the trendline that held since the lows until Q2 earnings were released. The chart shows when SIlicon Valley Bank failure occurred. Due to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and a few other banks at the same time, the Fed injected massive liquidity. Some of that liquidity went into Apple stock and drove the stock higher. Going into earnings, Wall Street was very bullish on Apple, and bullish investors were hoping to drive Apple stock to about $210 after earnings. The Arora Report warned you ahead of earnings that fundamentals were deteriorating. We wrote ahead of earnings: From a fundamental perspective, the rise shown in AAPL stock on the chart has occurred with deteriorating earnings. If the consensus is correct, AAPL is on track for three quarters in a row of declining revenues. RSI shown on the chart shows a divergence. We wrote prior to earnings: The chart shows RSI divergence. In plain English, this means that RSI went lower as the stock price went higher. From a technical perspective, this is a warning signal ahead of earnings. RSI on the chart shows that now Apple is oversold. The chart shows that Apple has now fallen to the top of the support zone. A major key for the entire stock market now is dependent on Apple not dipping much below the upper band of the support zone. If Apple bounces from here or after only a slight dip in the buy zone, it will be positive for the stock market. On the other hand, if Apple breaks below the support zone, it will be negative for the stock market. Prudent investors should pay attention to the market reaction to earnings from Datadog Inc (NASDAQ:DDOG). Datadog has been pushed by many as an AI stock. Earnings were better than expected, and the guidance, for the most part, was inline with consensus. And yet, the stock has fallen 19% in the early trade. The reason is that whisper numbers were much higher than the consensus due to exuberance over AI. In a significant negative development, Moody’s, one of the three major rating agencies, has cut credit ratings on ten U.S. banks due to office real estate exposure and higher funding costs. In their exuberance, the momo crowd has run up stocks of regional banks disregarding issues with real estate loans and higher funding costs. Moody’s also said that it may downgrade credit ratings of major U.S. lenders such as U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), Bank of New York Mellon Corp (NYSE: BK), State Street Corp (NYSE: STT), and Truist Financial Corp (NYSE: TFC). Chinese exports fell by 14.5% year-over-year vs. 12.5% consensus. Exports to the U.S. fell by 23%. Exports to the E.U. and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations fell by 21%. These are the biggest drops since the start of the pandemic. Since China is the factory to the world, this indicates that the consumer demand for goods is falling.

2023-08-09,"Critical Inflation Data Ahead, Credit Card Debt Hits $1 Trillion, China Enters Deflation","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Consumer Price Index Ahead Please click here for a chart of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Note the following: The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of AAPL stock is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows AAPL stock bounced from the top band of the support zone. The Arora Report has an unrivaled record of providing support zones, resistance zones, buy zones, and target zones over a long period of time. We previously wrote: Apple stock is the largest stock in the market, has heavy weight in indexes, and is the most beloved stock perceived by many as a safe stock. For this reason, whatever happens to Apple stock has a disproportionate impact on the entire stock market. The all important Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is ahead. CPI will be released Thursday at 8:30am ET. The consensus is 0.2% for both core and headline CPI. Producer Price Index (PPI) will be released on Friday at 8:30am ET. The consensus is 0.2% for both core and headline PPI. The Fed released its latest Household Debt and Credit report. Here are the key points: Household debt hit $17T in the latest report. $2.9T of that debt has accumulated from the end of 2019. Credit card debt hit a record $1.03T, increasing 4.6% quarter-over-quarter. Auto loans also increased, following the trend. Student loan balances decreased to $1.57T. Mortgage balances and home equity credit lines were stable. Especially important for prudent investors is the question about a potential recession. In The Arora Report analysis, a recession has been postponed to 2024. The main reasons are AI frenzy in the stock market, excessive consumer spending, leftover funds in consumers’ pockets from pandemic government programs, and Bidenomics. The fact that credit card debt has reached a record shows that one source of spending is borrowing. This cannot last forever. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. China The news is that China has entered deflation. In The Arora Report analysis, it is nowhere near as bad as the headline appears for the following reasons. July CPI came at +0.2% month-over-month vs. -01.% consensus. This data indicates that prices went up in July, not down. CPI came at -0.3% year-over-year vs. -0.4% consensus. This indicates that prices went down less than expected. We have been sharing with you for a while that prices at the producer level continue to fall. We also shared with you related data yesterday that exports of Chinese goods fell. We wrote: Chinese exports fell by 14.5% year-over-year vs. 12.5% consensus. Exports to the U.S. fell by 23%. Exports to the E.U. and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations fell by 21%. These are the biggest drops since the start of the pandemic. Since China is the factory to the world, this indicates that the consumer demand for goods is falling. PPI came at -4.4% year-over-year vs. -4.4% consensus. The Chinese government has ordered economists to tone down negative pieces about the Chinese economy. In The Arora Report analysis, the data increases the probability of stimulus by the Chinese government. Of course, these days stock markets everywhere, not just in the U.S., love government stimulus. Magnificent Seven Money Flows In the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and AAPL. In the early trade, money flows are negative in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ). The dichotomy between positive money flows in the magnificent seven stocks but negative money flows in index ETFs in the early trade sets the stock market up for an interesting day.

The Nasdaq 100 briefly touched its lowest point since July 11, experiencing a 1% drop as of midday trading. Reviving concerns about inflation is the recent surge in energy prices. WTI crude oil has surged back to $83 per barrel, marking its highest level since November 2022, while natural gas surged by over 6%, hitting its highest level since the end of January 2023. Economists are anticipating a rise in the annual inflation rate for July, with expectations moving from 3% to 3.3%. This would end a one-year stretch of declining prints in the annual CPI rate.

The consumer price index (CPI) increased from 3% year-on-year in June to 3.2% in July, the first increase in a year but less than the projected 3.3%.

2023-08-11,"Biden Sours The Sentiment By Calling China A Ticking Time Bomb, Hotter PPI Against Stock Market Momo Narrative; Money Flows Negative In Apple, Tesla, And Nvidia","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Hotter PPI Please click here for a chart of China ETF Xtrackers Hvst CSI 300 China A-Shs ETF (NYSE:ASHR). Note the following: The Arora Report has been warning you for a while that the worsening relationship between the U.S. and China is a risk that long term, prudent investors need to take into account. Biden has soured the stock market sentiment by calling the Chinese economy a “ticking time bomb.” Biden also called the Communist Party’s leaders “bad folks.” Biden also jabbed China’s President Xi by calling his signature Belt and Road Initiative the “debt and noose.” The chart shows that unlike in the U.S., the AI rally in China did not sustain itself. Chinese companies are spending as heavily on AI as U.S. companies, but the AI frenzy has not taken hold among investors in China as it has among investors in the U.S. The chart shows the downward sloping trendlines in the Chinese stock market. In contrast, there are upward sloping trendlines in the U.S. stock market. Producer Price Index (PPI) came hotter than expected. Here are the details: Headline PPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.2% consensus. Core PPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.2% consensus. There were whisper numbers that core PPI would come below the consensus due to lower PPI in China. American producers are highly dependent on Chinese imports. In The Arora Report analysis, the rise in PPI runs counter to momo gurus’ bullish narrative that inflation is over and done with and the Fed is going to cut interest rates. Please click here for a chart of yesterday’s stock market price action. The price action shown on the chart is negative from a technical perspective. There is concern that the stock market in the U.S. ran up yesterday morning after the release of CPI but smart money sold into the strength generated by momo buying, causing a reversal. The sell off was aided by the poor Treasury auction. Please read the Afternoon Capsule for details.

2023-08-11,"US Stocks Falter On PPI Data, Nasdaq Hits 1-Month Low: What's Driving Markets Friday?","U.S. equities were unable to break free from the bears’ grip, with tech continuing to underperform the rest of the market. The release of higher-than-expected producer inflation numbers in July, which climbed from 0.2% to 0.8% year-on-year, above estimates of 0.7%, dominated headlines Friday. The surprise in the PPI reading has awakened marginal upticks in market expectations for Fed rate hikes, even though traders remain largely convinced (with an 89% probability) that the Fed will opt to leave rates on hold in September. Te 2-year yield moved up 5 basis points to 4.9%, impacting rate-sensitive assets. Cues From Friday's Trading: The S&P 500 Index was down 0.2% on Friday, on track to close its second straight week of losses. The Nasdaq 100 Index fell 0.9%, underperforming other major U.S. averages, on pace for its second consecutive week in the red for the first time this year. Blue-chip stocks in the Dow Jones held up nicely, gaining 0.2% on the day and on track for a slightly positive weekly close.

The analyst said despite the tame inflation data, stocks moved in a lackluster manner on Thursday due to the rising bond yields. “Hard for equities to be happy with rising yields,” he said, adding that yields have been rising for most of 2023. “This does mean second half of 2023 or even rest of August a write off,” Lee said. He noted that equities have seen better returns and rise 78% of the time when the market gained more than 15% in July and was down the first three sessions of August. The market rises only 33% of the time when the first three days of August are positive, he added. 8/But this doesn't mean second half 2023 or even rest of August a write off:Since 1950:– when markets up >15% July– AND equities down first 3 daysAugust sees better returns:– rises 78% of time By contrast, when first 3 days positive, rises only 33% of time pic.twitter.com/fWtlM6Gvaa— Thomas (Tom) Lee (not drummer) FSInsight.com (@fundstrat) August 11, 2023 Friday’s Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading on Friday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.2% lower to $445, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.2% to $352 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 0.8% lower to $365, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The core PPI index, which excludes the more volatile components of food and energy, maintained a year-on-year increase of 2.4% for July, matching the previous month’s figure but exceeding market expectations, which were at 2.3%.

2023-08-13,"'Rich Dad, Poor' Dad Author Calls This Asset 'God's Dollar' As Dollar Dominance Faces Threat From BRICS Common Currency","“Rich Dad, Poor Dad” author Robert Kiyosaki on Saturday took to X to sing one of his favorite investment tunes. What Happened: “Gold is God's $, Kiyosaki said, adding that the asset has “magical, spiritual and mysterious power.” The metal, according to the best-selling author, is “stored financial energy” and why people have for centuries “sought, bought and fought for it.” Treat Gold with respect & God may bless you with gold's financial magic, Kiyosaki said. The author has always thrown his weight behind gold, silver and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), and has been calling for the dollar's demise. In late July, Kiyosaki warned that the dollar would go out of favor as the BRICS nations, along with the countries that expressed a desire to join the alliance, proposed the launch of a common currency named “bric” that would be tied to gold. “1 birc = 1oz of gold = $3,000. By bye USA,” Kiyosaki said at the time. The BRICS nations will meet at the Johannesburg Sandton Convention Centre in South Africa from Aug. 22 to 24. Although rumors suggested that the countries would announce a common currency, a South African official clarified that the BRICS currency would not be on the agenda at the meeting. See Also: What Is The Cheapest Way To Buy Gold Dooms Day Prophet: Following Fitch's downgrade of the sovereign rating of the U.S., Kiyosaki said to “Brace for crash landing.” The author previously took exception to America's debt overload and said it would lead to bankruptcy. “America’s debt is going up…so stock market going up. Numb nuts. America is broke,” he said. In mid-July, Kiyosaki clarified that he does not invest in stock or bond markets. As an entrepreneur, I like my hands-on control too much. Yet too many signs point to a severe stock market crash, he said. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), an exchange-traded fund that allows investors access to the gold bullion market, ended Friday’s session at $177.60. The ETF had gained about 4.7% this year, according to Benzinga Pro data. This compares to S&P 500’s 16.3% gain.

2023-08-14,"Stock Buying On Bad News From China, Market Makers Hedged For The First Time In 2023","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Market Makers Hedged Please click here for a chart of Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ). Note the following: The chart shows that QQQ touched the low band of the resistance zone and backed off. The chart shows that the trendline supporting the recent rise is now broken. RSI on the chart shows that in the very short term the stock market has become oversold. Early this morning, the momo crowd aggressively bought stock futures on bad news from China. The latest news is that Zhongzhi Enterprise, a top wealth manager, is unable to make payments on high yield investment trusts it sold to wealthy Chinese. In response to this situation, the banking regulator in China has set up a task force. In separate news, Country Garden, one of the biggest real estate developers in China, is having difficulty making payments on some of its bonds. The news that the Chinese regulator is setting up a task force got the momo crowd excited to buy U.S. stock futures aggressively in the early morning. The momo crowd has a good reason to buy. The chart shows when Silicon Valley Bank failed and the banking crisis occurred in the U.S. In response to the bank failures, the Fed flooded the system with liquidity. Some of the liquidity went into the stock market at the same time the AI frenzy was accelerating. This caused the rally that started on March 8 as shown on the chart. The momo crowd is hoping that the stock market will now run up because of government intervention to stop more failures in China. As the morning progressed, smart money took advantage of the strength generated by momo crowd buying and started selling. Smart money selling caused the early morning rally in stock futures to evaporate as of this writing. In a separate development, for the first time in 2023, market makers are gamma hedged. This is a major development, and prudent investors should pay attention. The reason is that about two thirds of the magnitude of the stock market rally in 2023 is attributable to market mechanics. One of the market mechanics that has helped the stock market run up is short gamma squeeze. For those who want to understand this deeply, there is a new podcast titled “Market Mechanics: Impact Of Dealers’ Gamma Position Change On The Stock Market” in post production. The podcast will be available in Arora Ambassador Club. The club has several other podcasts to help you understand market mechanics in-depth.

2023-08-15,"US Stocks Resume Losses, Banks Fall on Fitch's Downgrade Concerns: What's Driving Markets Tuesday?","Sentiment remained depressed on Tuesday, with the U.S. stock market trading in the negative after Monday’s positive session, weighed down by poor Chinese data and a warning from Fitch that it may have to downgrade major US banks, including JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). Higher-than-predicted retail sales in July, rising 0.7% month-on-month compared to the 0.4% expected, failed to rescue stocks. Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said the Fed may need to examine more data before deciding on further rate increases. He also remarked on the need to avoid a 1970s-type scenario where the Fed stopped raising rates too soon. Cues From Tuesday's Trading: The S&P 500 Index fell 0.8%, breaking below 4,450 points.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note is at the highest level since October 2022. “The yield will eventually settle back down in the mid-to-high threes if our forecast is right,” the analysts said. “A Fed pause is increasingly likely in September, which should help send rates down and prop up core bond returns,” they added. The U.S. debt situation is unlikely to cause the type of market volatility experienced in 2011, Buchbinder and Gillum said. That said, they said stocks have moved a bit past what is justified by fundamentals in the short term and a 5%-10% pullback is overdue.

2023-08-15,"Consumers Splurge But Fitch Warning And China Data Hit The Sentiment, Saudi Arabia Buys Nvidia Chips","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Consumers Splurge Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX). Note the following: The chart shows that the stock market backed off after touching the low band of the mini resistance zone but is still significantly above the top support zone. RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is coming out of the oversold condition. The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. Therefore, retail sales data carries heavy weight in the adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change. The U.S. consumer continues to splurge. Here are the details from the data just released: July retail sales came at 0.7% vs. 0.4% consensus. July retail sales ex-auto came at 1.0% vs. 0.4% consensus. In The Arora Report analysis, strong retail sales data is a double edged sword. On one hand, consumer splurging is postponing the recession. On the other hand, it will force the Fed’s hand to maintain high interest rates for longer. In spite of strong retail sales, sentiment is taking a hit this morning because of two developments. The rating agency Fitch is warning that it may downgrade credit ratings of several U.S. banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM). Previously, Moody’s downgraded ten banks including U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) and Truist Financial Corp (NYSE:TFC). Economic data from China is weak. Here are the details: July retail sales came at 2.5% year-over-year vs. 4.5% consensus. Industrial production came at 3.7% year-over-year vs. 4.4% consensus. Peoples’ Bank of China reduced its one year lending facility rate to 2.5% from 2.6% and reduced the 7-day reverse repo rate 1.80% from 1.90%. Youth unemployment in China has been rising rapidly. The Chinese government is responding by saying it will no longer publish youth employment data. The youth unemployment rate in China is now at 21.3%. In an important earnings report for the stock market, Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) is guiding FY23 revenue down 2% - 5% and earnings down 7% - 13%. The company is also announcing a new $15B share repurchase program. In a noteworthy development, Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE: BRK-B), Warren Buffett’s company, is buying three home builder stocks: Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN), DR Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI), and NVR Inc (NYSE: NVR). Retail investors have been aggressively buying BRK.B stock.

Magnificent Seven Money Flows Saudi Arabia and U.A.E. are buying billions of dollars worth of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. Saudi Arabia has bought 3,000 H100 chips from Nvidia.

This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

2023-08-16,"Fed Minutes Ahead, China Tells Funds To Not Sell Stocks, Intel Deal Scrapped Because Of China","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Fed Minutes Please click here for a chart of VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH). Note the following: Semiconductors are the leading sector and prime beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence frenzy. The chart shows when NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings were reported. The chart shows that semiconductors took off when Nvidia guided $11B of revenue vs. $7B consensus. The chart shows a downward sloping trendline as part of consolidation after a big run up in semiconductors. The chart shows that semiconductors touched the top band of the support zone before it bounced. Semiconductor ETF SMH is in both Model Portfolios in ZYX Allocation Alert. Semiconductors are the ‘picks and shovels’ plays to generate profit from artificial intelligence. At the present time, semiconductor picks and shovels plays are the best stocks to invest in artificial intelligence. Those who want a deeper understanding and next-level information will find several podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club on this subject. In a new development related to semiconductors, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is scrapping its deal to buy Israeli semiconductor company Tower Semiconductor Ltd (NASDAQ:TSEM). The buyout did not receive Chinese approval. The deal has fallen casualty to worsening U.S. China relations. The Chinese government is telling large investment funds to not be a net seller of stocks. Yesterday we shared with you that Peoples’ Bank of China has lowered its interest rates. We previously shared with you that the Chinese government was consulting stock market experts on ways to run up the stock market. The Chinese government is trying to turn negative sentiment about its economy to positive. One of the best ways for a government to create positive sentiment about the economy is to run up the stock market. This is also done by the U.S. government without being explicit. The difference is that the Chinese government is very open and explicit about their attempts to run up the stock market. Fed minutes will be released at 2pm ET. In The Arora Report analysis, the economic data released since the Fed meeting has made these Fed minutes obsolete. However, be alert as they may move the markets.

2023-08-17,Wall Street Wakes Up And Blames Market Mechanics For The Stock Market Sell Off,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Market Mechanics Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX). Note the following: The chart shows when The Arora Report gave a signal to raise hedges. The chart shows that so far in August, aggressive buying by the momo crowd is failing to run up the stock market. Wall Street is finally waking up and blaming market mechanics for the sell off. 0DTE options are being singled out for the sell offs that occur late in the day. As an Arora Report member, you knew in advance that market mechanics were changing and a sell off may ensue, at least temporarily. From the Morning Capsule from The Arora Report dated August 14: In a separate development, for the first time in 2023, market makers are gamma hedged. This is a major development, and prudent investors should pay attention. The reason is that about two thirds of the magnitude of the stock market rally in 2023 is attributable to market mechanics. One of the market mechanics that has helped the stock market run up is short gamma squeeze. For those who want to understand this deeply, there is a new podcast titled “Market Mechanics: Impact Of Dealers’ Gamma Position Change On The Stock Market” in post production. The podcast will be available in Arora Ambassador Club. The club has several other podcasts to help you understand market mechanics in-depth. In plain English this means that some of the fuel that led to the stock market rise this year is now spent. It is of especially noteworthy that Wall Street knew that market mechanics were responsible, in large part, for the rally this year but never expressed that as long as the stock market was rising. Now that the stock market has pulled back slightly, they are blaming market mechanics. We have been sharing with you data in the Morning Capsules showing strong consumer spending. Since the U.S. economy is 70% consumer based, consumer spending is very important. Consumers have been flush with cash from government programs and as a result, developed habits of excessive spending. Of course, you know that the government financed these programs with heavy borrowing. It looks like an important prior call from The Arora Report may prove to be spot on – the call was that consumers would run out of excess savings by October. Now the call is getting support from research from the Federal Bank of San Francisco. The report says that consumers held less than $190B in excess savings in June and the savings are likely to be exhausted by the end of September. Of special note is that earnings from Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) are better than the consensus. Yields on long term bonds across the globe are rising after Federal Reserve minutes released yesterday. Please read the Afternoon Capsule for details. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents.

2023-08-18,"Favorite AI Stock, Hedge Funds Win At The Expense Of Asset Allocators – Investors Discover Massive National Debt","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Hedge Funds Win Please click here for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT). Note the following: The chart shows that the long bond ETF has fallen to the top band of the support zone. Bonds trade inverse to the yield. We have been sharing with you in the Capsules that yields at the long end are rising. Unless you have been under a rock, you know that over the last few months there has been a chorus of asset allocators in the media singing a song of buying long term bonds. Their thesis has been that 3.5% - 4% yield on a 30 year bond was attractive, and investors needed to lock in that yield by buying long term bonds. They themselves have been buying long term bonds for their clients. In contrast to the asset allocators, hedge funds have been aggressively short selling long bonds. As of this writing, the yield on 30 year Treasuries has risen to 4.397%. In absolute terms, the difference between 3.7% and 4.39% may not seem like much, but when you look at it for a 30 year duration, it makes a big difference. This is reflected in the chart of TLT. At least temporarily, hedge funds have won the battle at the expense of asset allocators and their clients. The immediate reason for rising yields at the long end has been that the momo crowd has all of a sudden discovered that the U.S. has a serious national debt problem. At The Arora Report, we got our members out of long bonds a long time ago. Since then signals have been given as tactical trades to buy TLT a few times. You may recall that our strategic position was to buy leveraged inverse ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury (NYSE:TBT). This position was highly profitable. TBT went from a low of $15.52 in November 2021 to a high of $39.33 in October 2022. As a comparison TBT is trading at $35.52 as of this writing. The Arora Report call for the fixed income portion of the portfolio has been to keep it in short term Treasury bills. For those who insist on a 60/40 portfolio and insist on buying bonds, so far, The Arora Report call has been spot on. Due to its importance, the following has been in every Morning Capsule for a while: Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. Both hedge funds and asset allocators rushed into Chinese stocks and more importantly Chinese bonds not that long ago. Many Chinese bonds have recently been decimated. Chinese currency yuan has been weakening against the dollar. Chinese stocks have not done well. ZYX Emerging from The Arora Report has followed China continuously for 16 years. As both hedge funds and asset allocators were rushing into China, our ratings on China were suspended. Gloom is spreading in two areas. The potential housing crisis in China. The Chinese housing market is overbuilt and over leveraged. Evergrande, China’s property giant, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday. Defaults are increasing in the Chinese shadow banking market. On the positive side, Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) reported strong earnings. Applied Materials is one of the biggest manufacturers of semiconductor equipment. The demand for semiconductors is exploding due to artificial intelligence investments by companies across the world. Applied Materials is in the ZYX Buy Model Portfolio by The Arora Report, and AMAT is one of our favorite artificial intelligence stocks to buy. However, this is not a call to buy Applied Materials right here. The position in the portfolio is long from $16. AMAT traded as high as $143.62 after hours after release of good earnings. However, the stock is falling this morning in the premarket on the general malaise about tech stocks. Consider waiting for a dip in the buy zone to buy. On the negative side for stock market bulls, the momo crowd has finally discovered that yields are rising. They have stopped aggressively buying and are now selling. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.

2023-08-18,US Stocks Brace for Toughest Week Since March Amid China Concerns: What's Driving Markets Friday?,"The major U.S. stock indices continued to weaken as of 1:30 p.m. ET trading in New York. They are poised to conclude the third consecutive week of losses, also marking the worst weekly performance since March. This losing streak has not been witnessed for the S&P 500 since March 2023 and for the Nasdaq 100 since late 2022, raising concerns of an ongoing trend shift. China remains in the spotlight as uncertainty escalates over the risk of contagion, which now casts shadows on state-owned enterprises, once relatively untouched by the repayment troubles orbiting the country’s real estate sector. The stock market session remains relatively flat, while the bond arena witnesses a slight drop in yields driven by global concerns. Nevertheless, 10-year benchmark yields are ending the week around 4.25%, having briefly breached 4.33% and reached heights not seen since October 2007. Cues From Friday's Trading: The S&P 500 Index fell 0.2%, down 2.4% this week, the worst since March. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 0.1% lower, down 2.4% for the week. The Nasdaq 100 Index continued to slid, down 0.4%, hitting lows last seen on June 9, 2023. Small caps were the bright spot, with the Russell 2000 Index rising 0.5%, snapping a four-day losing streak.

2023-08-21,Nvidia Earnings And Jackson Hole Will Determine What Is Next For The Stock Market,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. What Is Next Please click here for a chart of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Note the following: The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of Nvidia stock is being used to illustrate the point. What happens next in the stock market will come down to Nvidia earnings and Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole. The chart shows when Nvidia earnings were last released. Nvidia guided current revenues to $11B from $7B for the quarter. The gap up shown on the chart added about $184B in market cap. This was the third largest market cap gain in one day in U.S. stock market history. Nvidia earnings accelerated the AI frenzy rally. The chart shows that there was a 262% gain in the Nvidia position if it was bought in the Arora buy zone shown on the chart. In addition, the trade around position in Nvidia has been nicely profitable. Trade around positions are a technique used by hedge funds and billionaires that can dramatically increase your returns and reduce your risks. To learn about trade around positions, please see the Trade Management Guidelines. In The Arora Report analysis, the demand for AI chips from Nvidia is far exceeding supply. As good as this sounds, the whisper numbers have moved up. Nvidia guided current quarter sales to $11B but whisper numbers are around $12B. A lot will also depend on what Nvidia guides for the current quarter that ends in October. Whisper numbers are around $12.5B. A major factor will also be what Nvidia guides for 2025. In The Arora Report analysis, if no other competition emerges, Nvidia will be looking at $18B in quarterly revenues. On the surface, Nvidia stock seems very expensive. It is trading at a forward PE of 42. However, in The Arora Report analysis, this PE can be justified based on the potential growth. Prudent investors should stick to the discipline of buying strategic positions in the buy zones and surrounding them with trade around positions as signals are given. Nvidia earnings are scheduled to be released on Wednesday after the close. Powell will be speaking at Jackson Hole on Friday. Bulls are hoping that he will say rate cuts are coming. Momo gurus are already laying the groundwork to twist his words to run up the stock market irrespective of what he says. In The Arora Report analysis, the highest probability is that Powell will say the Fed will be data dependent.

2023-08-21,"US Stocks Mixed, Treasury Yields Soar To More Than A Decade High: What's Driving Markets Monday?","On Monday, U.S. stocks made a cautious attempt at bouncing back following three consecutive weeks of losses. The upward momentum seems uncertain, and the recent increases in Treasury yields are posing challenges for the market bulls. The 10-year Treasury yield reached 4.35%, reaching its highest level since October 2007. NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stood out as a positive exception, moving higher by 5%. This boost was attributed to analysts revising their price targets in a positive direction and investors eagerly awaiting the earnings report set for Wednesday.

2023-08-22,Positive Stock Market Sentiment From Wall Street Positioning For Another Leg Of AI Frenzy And PPT Buying Stocks In China,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Positive Sentiment Please click here for a chart of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Note the following: There is positive sentiment in the stock market in the early trade for a number of reasons explained below. The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of Nvidia stock is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows Nvidia's 8.47% gain on aggressive investor buying ahead of earnings that will be released tomorrow after the close. We shared with you various factors related to Nvidia in the prior Morning Capsule before most of the big rise yesterday. The chart shows that Nvidia is up another 2.41% as of this writing in the premarket. The chart shows the big rise in Nvidia when it reported earnings last quarter. Investors are expecting a similar rise Wednesday after the close. The Arora Report very long term target on Nvidia was raised this morning. Other than that, there is no change in our prior call on Nvidia. We previously wrote: In The Arora Report analysis, the demand for AI chips from Nvidia is far exceeding supply. As good as this sounds, the whisper numbers have moved up. Nvidia guided current quarter sales to $11B but whisper numbers are around $12B. A lot will also depend on what Nvidia guides for the current quarter that ends in October. Whisper numbers are around $12.5B. Historically, it is common for a high flying stock to fall after great earnings because even great earnings often do not match high whisper numbers. To persuade their followers to buy Nvidia stock now before the earnings, momo gurus are preempting the possibility of Nvidia earnings coming below the high whisper numbers with a new mantra. The new mantra is even if Nvidia earnings are less than whisper numbers, it does not matter because the artificial intelligence frenzy will ultimately run the stock higher. Wall Street is positioning for another leg up in the artificial intelligence frenzy rally. Understanding positioning gives investors an edge. For those who are interested in learning about positioning, listen to the podcast titled “Market Mechanics: Positioning.” Investors are also excited about stocks in Hong Kong rising about 2% within minutes. In The Arora Report analysis, the 2% rise in Hong Kong stocks was most likely caused by the Chinese Plunge Protection Team (PPT) buying stocks through state entities. PPT is believed to be a secretive team inside the Chinese government with the responsibility to buy stocks to stop them from plunging. Chinese learned from the U.S. The U.S. government is also believed to have a secretive PPT to buy stocks as needed. Adding to the positive sentiment is the fact that the Chinese government sold dollars through banks. The momo crowd likes anytime a foreign country or the U.S. government does something to weaken the dollar. The reason is that S&P 500 derives a large portion of its earnings from overseas. When the dollar weakens, it translates to higher earnings when converted into dollars. In The Arora Report analysis, a strong currency is the hallmark of a strong country. In our analysis, it is very myopic of the momo crowd to celebrate a weaker dollar. The long term interest of dollar based investors is in a stronger dollar, not a weaker dollar. On the earnings front, there are three important earnings: Macy’s Inc (NYSE: M) beat the consensus but is cautious about the future. The stock is falling 7.6% as of this writing in the premarket. DICK'S Sporting Goods Inc (NYSE:DKS) missed earnings. The stock is plunging over 20% as of this writing in the premarket. Lowe's Companies Inc (NYSE:LOW) beat the consensus. The stock is up 2.53% as of this writing in the premarket. S&P has cut the credit ratings of several U.S. banks including Keycorp (NYSE:KEY) and Comerica Incorporated (NYSE:CMA). Perma bears are out in full force warning investors about rising yields, geopolitics, lower earnings, high national debt, potential rise in inflation again, hawkish Fed, and the risk from Powell’s upcoming speech at Jackson Hole on Friday. Perma bulls are responding by saying none of these negatives matter because artificial intelligence will boost productivity. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. BRICS Attack The Dollar BRICS is a bloc consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. BRICS are meeting in South Africa. President Ramaphosa of South Africa has invited leaders from 67 countries to attend the summit. Interestingly, the U.S. and its European allies were not invited. The summit has two focuses: Expanding BRICS with 40 additional countries who want to join BRICS. Attacking the U.S. dollar to reduce the power of the U.S. For all long term investors, it is important to allocate a part of the portfolio to emerging markets. The best way is to utilize the buy zones and ratings on 14 emerging countries that have been covered in ZYX Emerging from The Arora Report for 16 years. Investing in emerging markets is very different from investing in the U.S. Positions should be built slowly over a number of years.

Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.

2023-08-23,Stocks Rally Ahead Of Nvidia's Earnings; Treasury Yields Plunge On Soft Data: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?,"Stocks were rallying during midday trading, driven by the tech sector’s advances as investors eagerly await the quarterly earnings report from Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA), scheduled to be unveiled after the market close. A backdrop of lower-than-anticipated Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data and downward revisions in payroll projections, down by 306,000 for the year leading up to March 2023, has set the tone for the session, easing concerns about potential future rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

The analyst attributed the view to the lack of damage to the market depth amid the pullback and the composition of leadership underneath the surface. “At a high level, while there has been some technical damage, it has not been severe, and overall breadth is holding up relatively well,” Turnquist said. The measure the analyst used to quantify market depth was the percentage of S&P 500 stocks trading above their longer-term 200-day moving average. “The higher the percentage of stocks above their 200-dma, the more widespread the buying pressure is —implying the market's advance is likely sustainable,” he said. The technical strategist noted that over half of the index was still holding up above its 200-DMA, with cyclical or more offensive sectors outperforming.

2023-08-24,"Expect 'Sell The News' Reaction To Nvidia Earnings - Nvidia Saves The Stock Market From A Deeper Selloff,  Jackson Hole Kicks Off","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Nvidia To The Rescue Please click here for a chart of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Note the following: The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of Nvidia stock is being used because Nvidia is driving the big picture right now. The chart shows a gap up on blowout earnings. We previously shared with you prior to Nvidia earnings: The consensus is $11.2B in sales for the last quarter and $12.5B for the current quarter. The consensus is $18B per quarter starting in 2025. There will be many details in the earnings report. However, it is the revenue number and revenue projections that will mostly determine where the stock goes and, by extension, where the entire stock market goes. Earnings from Nvidia were one of the best we have seen in our over 30 years in the markets. Nvidia reported revenues of $13.5B for Q2. For the current quarter, Nvidia is guiding revenues of $16B. Nvidia reported Q2 data center revenues of $10.32B, up 141% from Q1. Nvidia is authorizing an additional $25B in share buyback. Permabears are out in force saying that Nvidia is a very expensive stock. They were saying the same thing when Nvidia reported earnings for Q1, and the stock gapped up as shown on the chart. In The Arora Report analysis, Nvidia is growing into its valuation. Given the current trends, our take now is very similar to our call that we published right after Q1 earnings. The prior call from three months ago is reproduced below for your convenience. Many investors on social media are sadly mistaken about what happened yesterday after hours. They are pointing to a very expensive evaluation of a trailing PE of 164, a forward PE of 63, and price/sales of 26. Yesterday’s earnings changed it all. If the present trend continues, in The Arora Report analysis, Nvidia will likely earn $10 - $12 in 2024. Using $11 as the mid-point and even after a 29% stock jump after hours, this translates to forward PE of 36. For a stock that performs significantly better than perfection, a forward PE of 36 is reasonable. As a matter of fact, The Arora Report is raising its target on Nvidia to $565 - $615, compared to the closing price of $305.38. Nvidia is in the ZXY Buy Model Portfolio. The Arora Report raised the target zone on NVDA ahead of earnings. Two thirds of the rise in the stock market in 2023 is due to market mechanics. When the stock market rises due to market mechanics, it is a highly risky market. The stock market, especially AI stocks, have been showing signs of being on the verge of a significant correction. However, the blowout earnings from Nvidia are saving the stock market from a drop. Thank you for all of your requests for a new in-depth podcast on the risks and rewards of Nvidia after earnings. We have started work on the podcast. The podcast will be available in Arora Ambassador Club. The Fed’s symposium in Jackson Hole kicks off today. Powell’s speech tomorrow is critical. Weekly initial jobless claims came at 230K vs. 240K consensus. Initial jobless claims are a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change. Durable goods data is mixed. Durable goods came at -5.2% vs. -4.0% consensus. Durable goods ex-transportation came at 0.5% vs. 0.2% consensus. Investors should be mindful of a potential sell the news reaction as the day progresses in spite of the bullishness this morning.

2023-08-25,"How To Protect Your Portfolio From The Next Crash With SPY, VIX, GLD, TLT, And UUP","The stock market is a volatile place, and it is impossible to predict when or if the next crash will happen. However, there are some things you can do to protect your portfolio from a market crash. One of the best ways to protect your portfolio from a market crash is to diversify your investments. This means investing in a variety of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities. By diversifying your portfolio, you can reduce your risk if one asset class performs poorly. For example, let's say you have a portfolio 100% invested in stocks. If the stock market crashes, your portfolio will likely lose a significant amount of value. However, if your portfolio is diversified, you may be able to offset some of these losses by investing in assets that perform well during market crashes, such as bonds or commodities. Another way to protect your portfolio from a market crash is to use hedging strategies. Hedging is a way to offset your losses in one asset class with gains in another asset class. Some popular hedging strategies include: Buying VIX calls: VIX is a measure of market volatility. When VIX is high, it means that investors are expecting a lot of volatility in the market. Buying VIX calls is a way to bet that the market will become more volatile, which could protect your portfolio from losses if the market crashes. Buying GLD stock: GLD (NYSE:GLD) is a gold ETF that tracks the price of gold. Gold is often seen as a safe haven asset, which means that its price tends to go up when the stock market is doing poorly. Buying GLD stock can help to protect your portfolio from losses during a market crash. Buying Treasury bonds: Treasury bonds are considered to be low-risk assets, which means that their prices tend to fall when the stock market crashes. This is because investors sell stocks and buy bonds when they are worried about the economy. When there is a lot of selling in the stock market, it drives down the prices of stocks and drives up the prices of bonds. Buying UUP: UUP (NYSE:UUP) is an ETF that tracks the value of the US dollar. When the US dollar is strong, it can help to protect your portfolio from losses in overseas investments. By using a combination of these strategies, you can reduce your risk and protect your portfolio from a market crash. It is also important to rebalance your portfolio regularly. This means selling some of your winners and buying more of your losers. By rebalancing your portfolio, you can keep your risk exposure at a manageable level. Finally, it is essential to stay calm and stay invested. The stock market has always recovered from crashes in the past, and it is likely to recover again. If you panic sell, you could lock in your losses. Here are some additional tips for protecting your portfolio from a market crash: Understand your risk tolerance: Before you start investing, it is important to understand your risk tolerance. This means understanding how much risk you are comfortable taking with your money. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose: This is especially important when investing in risky assets. Do your research: Before you invest in any asset, it is important to do your research and understand the risks involved. Get professional help: If you are not comfortable managing your own investments, you can get professional help from a financial advisor. By following these tips, you can protect your portfolio from a market crash and help ensure your financial future.

2023-08-28,"Don't Buy Into The Momo Narrative That Recession Probability Is Zero, China Props Up Stocks","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Recession Probability Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). Note the following: The chart shows that the stock market has pulled back after touching the low band of the mini resistance zone. The chart shows that the stock market is consolidating slightly above the top support zone. RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is neither overbought nor oversold and can go in either direction from here. Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole was about as expected. This AI frenzy driven market was mostly focused on Nvidia earnings. Please see prior capsules. Now that Nvidia earnings are behind, the stock market is focused on momo gurus’ narrative of no recession, the recession probability is zero, and the economy is heading toward no landing. As we have been sharing with you, lately the economic data has been very strong. A recession has clearly been postponed for two reasons. The consumer has continued to spend aggressively. Consumer savings went up during the pandemic due to free money and other government programs. This led to excessive consumer spending. The consumer has had difficulty changing the habit of excessive spending. Lower income households have now run down their savings and are maintaining their spending by borrowing. Higher income households own stocks and houses. They continue to spend because they feel richer as the AI frenzy has run up the stock market and house prices have held up due to lack of supply. Since most homeowners with a mortgage have interest rates locked in below 4%, no one wants to sell their house as new mortgage rates are over 7%. Excessive government borrowing and spending continues from the Inflation Reduction Act and the Infrastructure Act. Government spending is providing more stimulus to the economy than anticipated. Start with Arora’s Second Law of Investing and Trading. The second law states, “Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets.” Follow with Arora’s Third Law of Investing and Trading, which states “Making investing and trading decisions based on probabilities is the only realistic and profitable approach.” In The Arora Report analysis, the following are the probabilities going forward: Recession 45% Soft landing 35% No landing 20% It is important for investors to keep in mind that the stock market is priced for no landing and zero percent probability of a recession. The other important dynamic in the stock market is that a large number of investors now believe that a recession, interest rates, and the Fed do not matter due to investors’ enthusiasm for AI.

China We have been sharing with you that the Chinese government has been trying very hard to prop up its stock market. The Chinese government cut the tax on stock trading for the first time since the great financial crash of 2008. The CSI 300, the main index of Mainland Chinese stocks, jumped 5.5% at first, but then the gains started fading. Investors should take note that everytime the Chinese government tries to prop up the stock market, the stock market first jumps and then gives up most of the gains. In The Arora Report analysis, the reason the rallies are not sustained is that the economic data in China is weak.

This morning there are two new negative data points for the economy: The ADP employment change came at 177K vs. 195K consensus. Q2 GDP-second estimate came at 2.1% vs. 2.4% consensus. The rise in the stock market is due to three reasons. Excitement about AI - OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has reached a $1B run rate. iPhone 15 will be launched on September 12. Apple stock historically moves up going into the launch and sells off after the launch. Since Apple is the biggest stock and has heavy weight in indexes, it has a disproportionate impact.

2023-08-30,Markets Waver On Mixed Economic Data: 5 ETFs Moving Wednesday,"Markets embraced an unexpected turn of events as Wednesday’s U.S. economic data releases fell short of market expectations. The initial response was positive, with market participants interpreting the data as an indication of potentially easing inflationary pressures, thus lowering the specter of further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. However, as the morning session progressed, concerns over a potential economic deceleration reemerged, paring back the advances in the stock market. Q2 GDP Revised Lower, Employment Growth Missed Expectations in August The Bureau of Economic Analysis lowered growth projections for the second quarter of the year. The revelation painted a picture of the U.S. economy expanding at a more tempered pace of 2.1% on an annualized basis in Q2, in stark contrast to the estimate, which had pegged growth at a more robust 2.4%. The same report also unveiled that the PCE price index, a closely monitored inflation gauge by the Federal Reserve, was revised downward from 2.6% to 2.5% in Q2. A parallel adjustment was registered for the core PCE price index, dropping from 3.8% to 3.7%. As a result, Thursday’s PCE price index announcement for July will likely be awaited with less trepidation by investors. Signals from the labor market continue to support the idea of a slowdown in new job additions, with attention turning to the upcoming Bureau of Labor Statistics report this Friday. The ADP offered a preview by reporting an increase of 177,000 jobs in August. This marked a significant decrease compared to the upwardly revised 371,000 jobs in July and also fell short of the expected 195,000. Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Watch Cathie Wood Predict SEC’s Loss In Bitcoin ETF Case In Benzinga Interview Traders Lower Rate Hike Bets, Dollar Sinks The U.S. dollar fell 0.5%, the largest daily drop since mid July, and is currently on track for its third consecutive session of decline. Simultaneously, Treasury yields, reflective of market sentiment on future Fed rate hikes, took a precipitous drop. The yield on the 2-year note fell to 4.85%, the lowest since Aug. 11. Implied probabilities derived from Fed futures assign a mere 9% chance of a rate hike in September, down from yesterday’s 14%. Looking ahead to November, the odds of a rate increase have ebbed from 49% to a 43% chance, CME Group’s Fedwatch tool showed.

2023-08-30,Forget Stocks And Bonds - Here's Why Gold Is The Best Investment Right Now,"You might think bonds or T-bills look intriguing right now, with some offering nearly 5% back guaranteed. Or maybe you’ve been looking at Walt Disney Co’s (NYSE:DIS) stock, down 25% in the last year. But, according to DataTrek co-founder Nick Colas, it's time to bypass bonds and struggling stocks; gold is the investment to focus on. Colas points out that despite the fact that gold has underperformed the S&P 500 in the United States, it has held up better than most global stocks and equities. Colas also points out that demand for gold comes from different sources, including central banks wanting to bolster their balance sheets. Also Read: Is Cathie Wood The Next Warren Buffett? Apple, Tesla Define Their Investment Strategies Colas argues that because of an increase in demand for gold from central banks throughout the world, gold prices should steadily increase. Colas says that any increase in global geopolitical tensions could help push gold prices even higher. “Now, if you think we're going to have an outbreak of global peace, then gold is probably not a great trade, because central banks will see much less interest and not want to own as much gold,” Colas said in a recent YouTube video and blog post. “However, the current situation feels quite different. We have geopolitical tensions with Russia, with China. Turkey has its own issues.” How To Trade Gold: If you want to go long gold but don’t want to go out and buy physical gold, there are plenty of ETFs and other funds available on U.S. markets that provide solid gold exposure. Here are five gold ETFs that could be good options for longing the precious metal: SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM) iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF (BATS:AAAU) Now Read: Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF Ruling Shifts Sands Of Crypto Regulation: 3 Analysts Weigh In Photo: Shutterstock"

2023-09-06,"As Concerns About The Stock Market In September Mount, Prudent Investors Watching Semiconductors","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. The Leading Sector – AI Frenzy Please click here for a chart of semiconductor VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH). Note the following: As concerns about weak seasonality in the stock market mount, prudent investors are keeping an eye on semiconductors. The chart shows that semiconductors have been the leading sector due to artificial intelligence excitement. Semiconductor ETF SMH is up 53.9% so far this year. As always, human nature is such that any argument can be justified. Stock market bears are justifying their bearish view by pointing to a potential double top as shown on the chart. A double top is a negative pattern. Stock market bulls are pointing to the fact that semiconductors broke above the trendline shown on the chart as a positive. Bulls are also pointing to the fact that semiconductors bounced from the upper band of the support zone shown on the chart as a positive. RSI shown on the chart indicates that even though semiconductors went up yesterday on Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) win, the internal momentum is waning. From yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule, we wrote: In the face of all of the negative news, investors got excited by AMD’s forward camera win and are aggressively buying semiconductor stocks. The excitement is spilling into other tech stocks. AMD won the business from Hitachi Astemo for adaptive computing to power the new stereo format, forward looking camera for adaptive cruise control for autonomous emergency braking. Also helping AMD are comments by CEO Lisa Su regarding opportunity in AI around its MI250s and MI300s. The chart shows a leg up in semiconductors on extraordinary NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) earnings in May. However, as shown on the chart, semiconductors fell on extraordinary Nvidia earnings in August. The main reason behind the difference in the stock reaction is Wall Street mechanics. Investors can gain an edge by deeply understanding Wall Street mechanics. There are several podcasts on Wall Street mechanics in Arora Ambassador Club. There is selling in the premarket due to a big move in the dollar and Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins saying that “future tightening could be warranted.” The rise in oil prices is leading to fears of inflation reigniting.

Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

2023-09-11,CPI Report Countdown: 5 ETFs Bracing For August's Inflation Numbers,"As the market eagerly awaits the next CPI report, the overarching question remains: Is the U.S. economy on track to hit the Fed’s 2% inflation target, or are we grappling with more tenacious inflationary trends? The July Curveball and What’s In Store For August: Despite a year-long trend of dropping annual inflation rates, July threw us a curve with a jump from 3% to 3.2% — slightly under the anticipated 3.3%. Expectations point to headline inflation increasing to 3.6% YoY. On a monthly basis, the CPI is projected to advance by 0.6%, marking an acceleration from the 0.2% uptick in July. The factor to blame? Just look at oil prices. But here’s the twist – core inflation, often a truer tell of the underlying inflationary pressures, might dial down from 4.7% to 4.3%. Read also: The Biggest Short: Trader Bets $30K On 1,100% VIX Spike By February 2024 Market Speculations: Mixed inflation signals have investors buzzing about possible market movements post the August CPI release, which is set to occur on Sept. 13 at 8:30 a.m. ET. Here’s a recap of how five major ETFs moved following prior CPI announcements. 1. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) Aug. 10, 2023: On the day July’s CPI data came out, SPY barely blinked, staying flat. However, the following week was less serene, with the ETF sliding down by 2%. July 12, 2023: June’s CPI report seemed to spark some optimism. The SPY appreciated 0.8% on the back of the lower-than-anticipated figures, then maintained its momentum, climbing another 2% over the ensuing week. June 13, 2023: Once again, a softer inflation report led to a boost in investor confidence. SPY went up by 0.7% on the release day, and broadly maintained that level in the subsequent week. 2. iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSE:AGG) Aug. 10, 2023: AGG fell 0.7% on the day and slid another 1% the following week after July’s CPI release. July 12, 2023: Following June’s CPI, AGG gained 0.8% immediately and added another 0.8% over the week. June 13, 2023: Post-May’s CPI data, AGG dipped 0.5% but rebounded with a 0.8% rise in the subsequent week. 3. SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) Aug. 10, 2023: GLD dipped 0.1% on release day and went down another 1.3% over the week post-July’s CPI. July 12, 2023: After June’s CPI, GLD surged 1.4% on the day and then added 0.5% in the week. June 13, 2023: Post-May CPI, GLD dropped 0.7% and declined another 0.4% during the week. 4. iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) Aug. 10, 2023: Small-cap stocks tracked by the IWM ETF fell 0.4% on release day and went down another 3.7% over the week post-July’s CPI.

June 13, 2023: Post-May CPI, IWM saw a solid 1.1% rise and then declined 1.4% through the week. 5. iShares 20+ Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) Aug. 10, 2023: TLT took a hit of 1.7% on the day following July’s CPI and deepened its decline by 2.3% over the subsequent week.

June 13, 2023: Post-May’s CPI figures, TLT saw a 1% drop but rebounded with a notable 2.1% gain in the week that followed.

Auto Worker Strike Likely Please click here for a chart of General Motors Co (NYSE:GM). Note the following: The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of GM stock is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows that GM stock has given up all of its summer rally gains. The reason is a potential strike by United Auto Workers (UAW). President Biden claims to be the most pro-union president. President Biden has been predicting that UAW will not strike. In The Arora Report analysis, the probability of a UAW strike is very high. UAW President Shawn Fain is talking about the possibility of a simultaneous strike against GM, Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F), and Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA). In The Arora Report analysis, if there is a simultaneous strike against all three automakers, it will put Michigan in a recession and will have a major negative impact on the U.S. economy. The union is especially upset that new plants such as those for batteries are not unionized. UAW is blaming the Biden administration for giving away billions of dollars of subsidies without demanding wage standards. All of the foregoing is positive for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) as Tesla is not unionized. On August 29, we shared with you: Today, Tesla (TSLA) is turning on a massive NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) cluster consisting of 10,000 H100 GPUs. The cluster will be used to train FSD (Full Self-Driving). Tesla is also spending $1B to build its own Dojo supercomputer. There is heavy buying in TSLA stock in the early trade as a Wall Street bank highlights Dojo and states that Dojo can add up to $500B in value to Tesla. The momo crowd’s pattern is to buy ahead of events, ignoring the risk. The reason is that the momo crowd believes that every event that is ahead is going to run up the stock market. In the early trade, the momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks ahead of several events. CPI will be released on September 13 at 8:30am ET, followed by PPI on September 14 at 8:30am ET. The iPhone 15 launch is ahead. Historically, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock runs going into the launch and is sold after the launch. There is very heavy demand for ARM (ARM) IPO. The IPO is five times oversubscribed. The price is likely to be raised. Oracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) reports earnings after the close today. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) reports earnings on Thursday after the close. The momo crowd is excited about the AI potential of these two companies. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band.

2023-09-12,Investors Pay Attention To How Apple iPhone 15 Tests Nationalism Over Status Symbol In China,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. iPhone 15 Launch Please click here for a chart of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). Note the following: The Morning Capsule is about the big picture, not an individual stock. The chart of Apple stock is being used to illustrate the point. The chart shows the drop in Apple stock on the news of China banning government workers from using iPhones. The chart shows Apple stock is at the top of the support zone. RSI on the chart shows Apple stock is neither overbought nor oversold going into the iPhone 15 launch. This is unusual. Historically, Apple stock gets overbought just before the launch of a new iPhone model. The chart shows that Apple stock was on its way to becoming overbought when the news from China hit. Apple stock is extremely important to the entire stock market because Apple has a weight of about 7.5% in S&P 500 and about 10.8% in Nasdaq 100. On top of that, there are a large number of popular companies that are Apple suppliers and tend to move with Apple stock. Sentiment about technology stocks is very important to the entire stock market. Moves in Apple stock have a disproportionate effect on the sentiment. Many market participants have been using Apple stock this year to park uninvested cash in lieu of a money market fund. If Apple stock falls, such cash will flee the stock, exaggerating the fall. In The Arora Report analysis, one of the most important items that prudent investors need to keep an eye on is how the iPhone 15 launch tests rising nationalism in China over the iPhone as a status symbol. iPhone sales in China are very different from the U.S. and Europe. Almost no one in the U.S. buys the iPhone as a status symbol. However, in China, a large number of iPhone buyers are buying the iPhone not because they love the iPhone but because it shows they are wealthy. Until now, if Chinese wanted a 5G phone, they did not have many made in China options. Now with the launch of Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro, they have a choice. By many accounts, Mate 60 Pro is better than iPhone 15. Since government employees have been banned from using iPhones, will these government employees recommend to their friends and family to not buy iPhones? The foregoing is very important as about 20% of Apple’s sales and profits come from China. China sales are even more important than it appears on the surface because in the U.S. and Europe, the iPhone market is saturated. In view of Apple’s declining revenues quarter after quarter, Apple needs growth in China. Apple touts growth in countries like India and Indonesia. However, in absolute terms, these numbers are small. Traditionally, Apple stock falls after the launch of a new model. However, this time is different because Apple did not run up going into the launch due to the China news. Prudent investors should carefully watch the reaction to the iPhone 15 launch. The reaction will be a tell. Even if you invest only in the U.S., you cannot escape implications of the breakthroughs in semiconductors and AI that are occurring in China. What happens in China will have a major impact on your portfolio over the next decade. Therefore, it is important to develop a better understanding of where China is going. Listen to the podcast titled “Implications Of Chinese Breakthrough For Investors – Apple Example” in Arora Ambassador Club. Expect the momo crowd to also buy ahead of the all important CPI release tomorrow.

This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

2023-09-12,August Consumer Price Index Preview: Will 0.6% Monthly Inflation Rattle Markets?,"Following the conclusion of the Apple Wonderlust event, the market’s attention is shifting to Wednesday morning, when Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will be released. According to the forecasts, this forthcoming inflation report is expected to diverge significantly from recent ones, raising concerns that have been dormant for over a year. August Inflation Report: What Economists Are Predicting Economists are anticipating a substantial year-on-year surge in the overall CPI index for August, projecting a rate of 3.6%, a notable increase from the 3.2% recorded in July. More worrisome is the estimated monthly price pressure, which could climb to 0.6%, a substantial rise compared to the modest 0.2% observed in July. If this prediction holds true, it would mark the most significant monthly increase since June 2022. A spike in energy prices is to blame for the expected rise in the overall inflation rate for August. On a positive note, the core inflation rate, excluding energy and food components, is forecast to decrease from July’s 4.7% year-on-year to 4.3% in August. On a monthly basis, core inflation is expected to maintain a steady 0.2% pace, mirroring July’s figures. Leading up to the critical data release, market sentiment suggests a 93% probability, as indicated by Fed Futures, that the Federal Reserve will maintain unchanged interest rates during the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee Meeting.

These inflationary episodes occurred between April and June 2021, from October 2021 to March 2022 and again in May and June 2022. Notably, June 2022 marked the pinnacle of the post-pandemic inflationary surge, with the CPI surging at an extraordinary month-on-month rate of 1.2%. The CPI report for June 2022 was disclosed on July 13, 2022, and it had significant effects on major asset classes, leading to the following daily changes: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPX) down 0.5% Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) down 0.2% Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) down 0.7% SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) up 0.5% US Dollar Index (DXY) down 0.1% iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSE:TLT) up 1.2% The May 2022 CPI report, unveiled on June 10, 2022, displaying a monthly inflation rate of 0.9%, triggered even more pronounced responses: the S&P 500 plummeted by 2.9%, the Nasdaq 100 experienced a sharp 3.6% decline and the U.S. dollar surged by 0.9%.

2023-09-13,"Hotter Core Inflation But Momo Gurus Have A New Narrative, Quadruple Witching Ahead","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Hotter Core Inflation Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX). Note the following: The chart shows that the stock market is in between the top support zone and mini resistance zone. The chart shows that RSI is approaching oversold. The chart shows that, overall, the stock market is directionless. The newly released data shows that core inflation is running hotter than expected. Here are the details of the consumer price index. Headline CPI came at 0.6% vs. 0.6% consensus. Core CPI came at 0.3% vs. 0.2% consensus. Initially, both stock and bond markets reacted negatively to the hotter than expected core inflation, but buying came in quickly as momo gurus’ new narrative took hold. Momo gurus are often wrong. Nonetheless, you need to pay attention to them because the momo crowd blindly follows them. Momo gurus’ new narrative has two parts. Buy stocks because headline CPI came as expected. The flaw in this narrative is that on an annualized basis, headline CPI is at 7.2%. Momo gurus counter that the number is high because of higher oil prices and the resulting higher gas prices. Well, most people drive and spend money on gas; it is fine to exclude gas for analysis, but the reality is that rising oil prices can not simply be ignored. The second part of the momo gurus’ new narrative is to buy stocks by looking past the hotter than expected core CPI. The reason is that they claim to know that in the future core CPI will come down. Remember, Arora’s Second Law of Investing and Trading: “Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets.” The reality is that nobody knows, including momo gurus, what core CPI will do in the future. Producer Price Index, which measures inflation on the producer level, will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET. The U.S. economy is 70% consumer based. For this reason, prudent investors pay attention to retail sales. Retail sales data will be released tomorrow at 8:30am ET. The consumer has been on a buying binge with excessive spending. There are many metrics that are showing that the consumer is running out of cash and charging more and more to credit cards. Tomorrow’s data will be a tell on the status of consumer spending. Tech CEOs are heading to Washington for a seven hour long session with senators on AI. All 100 senators have been invited. Expect the momo crowd to try to move up AI stocks. However, the session is closed to cameras. This will limit any upside buying. Quadruple witching is ahead on Friday. In quadruple witching, stock index futures, futures options, stock options, and single stock futures expire. Quadruple witching often leads to volatility. Historically, often, quadruple witching in September is vicious. ARM IPO is 10 times oversubscribed. This is creating positive sentiment. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. Europe There is speculation that the European Central Bank will hike interest rates by 25 basis points tomorrow. The U.K.’s GDP contracted at the fastest monthly rate since December. Economic data in the U.K. has often led economic data in the U.S. India After the success of the G-20 summit in New Delhi, sentiment towards Indian stocks is approaching extremely positive.

2023-09-14,Excitement Over ARM IPO And AI But Slew Of Economic Data Shows Hotter Economy,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Slew Of New Economic Data Please click here for a chart of VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH). This is an important chart today in view of Arm Holdings American Depositary Shares (NASDAQ:ARM) IPO. Note the following: The chart shows semiconductors are levitating above the support zone. RSI on the chart shows that semiconductors are returning from an oversold condition. ARM IPO is today. ARM designs the chips that are used by many semiconductor manufacturers and are used in practically every smartphone available today. ARM is priced at $51 per share, raising close to $5B. The IPO was 10 times oversubscribed, which will likely push the stock higher when trading begins. In The Arora Report analysis, ARM is not an AI company, but facts do not matter in the stock market when investors are excited. ARM is being marketed as an AI company, and the momo crowd does not know any better. How high ARM trades after it opens will be an indication of investor sentiment, especially about AI. Semiconductors are the leading sector. How semiconductors perform after ARM IPO starts trading will also be a tell for the AI buying frenzy. Other than the ARM IPO, there is plenty of news to keep investors excited about AI. In The Arora Report analysis, the use of generative AI is rapidly expanding but competition is also increasing. The following illustrates the point: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is launching its generative AI tool to help sellers better describe their goods. Adobe Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) is undercutting the price of generative AI tools for images from OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates by 25 basis points. Importantly, ECB suggested it may be done raising interest rates. In The Arora Report analysis, the indication that ECB may be done raising interest rates is bullish for the stock market. In The Arora Report analysis, there is a slew of new economic data that shows the economy is hotter than the consensus. Inflation at the producer level is hotter than the consensus. Headline PPI came at 0.7% vs. 0.4% consensus. A big contributor is rising energy prices. Core PPI came at 0.2% vs. 0.2% consensus, but when trade is excluded, the data is hotter. The U.S. economy is about 70% consumer based. Therefore prudent investors pay attention to retail sales. The mighty American consumer continues to spend excessively, often borrowing to spend. Retail sales came at 0.6% vs. 0.2% consensus. Retail sales ex-auto came at 0.6% vs. 0.4% consensus. Overall, the jobs picture is staying strong. Weekly initial claims came at 220K vs. 226K consensus. Initial claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change. Barring a last minute agreement, UAW is likely to announce a strike tonight. In The Arora Report analysis, the trading leading to quadruple witching tomorrow is driving stock prices higher this morning. Investors need to remember that Wall Street mechanics play a major part in market movements. It is important for both long term and short term investors to deeply understand Wall Street mechanics.

No Fear Please click here for a chart of volatility index VIX . Note the following: VIX is the fear gauge of Wall Street. The chart shows that VIX has fallen to the lowest level in two years. The fall in VIX is on the longest streak since 2017 – 118 consecutive days without back to back closes over 20. The VIX has closed under the 200 day moving average for 123 days in a row. This is the first time this is happening since 2009. $3.4 trillion notional value of options are expiring today. This is the largest September option expiration ever. The momo crowd aggressively started buying Arm Holdings American Depositary Shares (NASDAQ:ARM) shares after the regular session close yesterday and has continued to aggressively buy ARM shares in the IPO. Why is the momo crowd buying ARM so aggressively? The reason is that they believe that ARM is an AI play on par with NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Nothing could be farther from the truth. From yesterday’s Morning Capsule: In The Arora Report analysis, ARM is not an AI company, but facts do not matter in the stock market when investors are excited. ARM is being marketed as an AI company, and the momo crowd does not know any better. ARM is attempting to pivot to become an AI company. It has yet to be seen if they can succeed. Thank you for all of your emails requesting a podcast on ARM. We are starting work on a podcast on ARM. The podcast will be available in Arora Ambassador Club. Wall Street is driven by fear and greed. Historically, it pays to sell when fear is sucked out of the stock market and to buy when greed is sucked out of the stock market. In The Arora Report analysis, the lack of fear is a reason to be cautious at this time. New data from China is spurring buying in stocks across the globe. The data indicates that China’s economy might be bottoming. Industrial production came at 4.5% year-over-year vs. 4% consensus. Retail sales came at 4.6% year-over-year vs. 3.0% consensus. Unemployment rate came at 5.2% vs. 5.3% consensus. UAW is surgically striking against all of the big three automakers. This is unprecedented.

2023-09-18,Investors Pay Attention: Saudi Arabia And Russia Making Fight Against Inflation Difficult,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Difficult Fight Against Inflation Please click here for a chart of oil futures that represent West Texas Intermediate. Note the following: The chart is of West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI). WTI, as tracked by the United States Oil Fund ETF (NYSE:USO) is the standard for the U.S. Brent crude. Brent is trading about $3 above WTI. $100 price for Brent is the magnet for traders. The chart shows a steep trendline. The main reason for the rise in oil price shown on the chart is that Saudi Arabia, in cooperation with Russia and other OPEC+ members, have successfully reduced the supply. The latest government stimulus in China may increase demand for oil in China. This is adding to the bullishness. Resilient U.S. economic data and American consumers’ willingness to spend is adding to the upward pressure on oil. In the past when gasoline prices rose, consumers would cut back on other discretionary purchases. However, this time is proving to be different so far. Rising gas prices are not having a negative impact on other discretionary purchases by American consumers. The American consumer has become used to excessive spending. Right now, lower income consumers can still borrow and higher income consumers still have savings. Also contributing to higher oil prices is general risk-on sentiment generated by higher stock prices and house prices holding up in spite of higher interest rates. The fear is that Saudi Arabia and Russia may want to tighten the screws on the West by trying to run up oil prices to $120 - $130. For more guidance, refer to world renown oil ratings from The Arora Report. You can see the oil ratings from the top menu in the Real Time Feeds. These ratings are based on the following: Geopolitics Sentiment Fund Flows Supply Demand Inventories Positioning Technicals Risk Appetite Economic Indicators Currencies FOMC, Bank of England, and Bank of Japan meetings are ahead this week. Rising oil prices are making the job of fighting inflation difficult for the Fed and the Bank of England. Japan imports almost all of the oil it uses. Rising oil prices may force the Bank of Japan to change its loose monetary policy. In The Arora Report analysis, if the Bank of Japan changes its loose monetary policy, it will have a negative impact on stocks in the U.S. The reason is that there is a lot of money that has been borrowed in Japan at low interest rates and then invested in the U.S. stock market. A concern is also developing about a potential government shutdown. On the positive side, early indications are that preorders for iPhone 15 are better than expected. This is good news because Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest stock and carries heavy weight in the indexes. After the successful IPO of Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM), excitement is building for IPOs of Instacart (NASDAQ:CART) and Klaviyo Inc. (NASDAQ:KVYO). As a full disclosure, ZYX Buy from The Arora Report has signals on both CART and KVYO. Saudi Arabia and Turkey are vying for the next Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) factory. Saudi Arabia is sweetening the deal with an offer of rights to purchase particular EV metals. Elon Musk is also scheduled to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister on Monday. Musk had previously indicated that the location for the next Tesla factory would be chosen by the end of the year. In The Arora Report analysis, Saudi Arabia and other oil rich Middle Eastern countries are using their oil riches to expand into growing areas such as EVs and AI. We are considering continuous coverage of Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries in ZYX Emerging by The Arora Report.

2023-09-19,"Dot Plot Will Be The Most Important Chart For Investors To Watch Tomorrow, Brent Crude Hits $95","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Dot Plot Please click here for the Fed’s prior dot plot. Note the following: The FOMC meeting is starting today. Tomorrow, the Fed will announce its decision at 2pm ET followed by Powell’s press conference at 2:30pm ET. The dot plot shows each FOMC participants’ projected mid point of the target for the federal funds rate. Each dot represents an FOMC participant. The chart shows that no FOMC participants projected a federal funds rate of less than 5.125% in 2023. The chart shows that one FOMC participant projected a federal funds rate above 6% in 2023. The chart shows wide dispersion in 2024. The highest projection is 5.875%. The lowest projection is 3.625%. In The Arora Report analysis, there is enough uncertainty in the economic data that the high end of the projection at 5.875% and the lower end of the projection 3.625% are both possible. This is why it is important for investors to start from Arora’s Second Law of Investing and Trading. Arora’s Second Law states, “Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets.” It is important to not get locked into a bullish or bearish point of view. Consider flowing with the new data points. The Morning Capsules are your best source of new data points that matter. For the most part, you can ignore new data points that are not mentioned in the Morning Capsule. The Fed is expected to release a new dot plot tomorrow. The most important information from the Fed meeting will be the dot plot. The consensus is that the Fed will have a hawkish statement but leave the rate unchanged. Regarding the dot plot, momo gurus believe the dot plot will show as many as five interest rate cuts. This is the reason momo gurus are giving to urge their followers to aggressively buy stocks. The historical record is clear – momo gurus have consistently been wrong, yet being wrong does not stop momo gurus from making new projections and pretending that they know what the market will do. Keep in mind that momo gurus’ real job is to run up the stock market under the disguise of analysis. Nonetheless, it is important to pay attention to what momo gurus are saying because they have legions of followers who do not deeply analyze but instead, blindly buy. Prudent investors should note that in contrast to the momo crowd, smart money is not engaging in wholesale buying of stocks at this time. The Arora Report has consistently called every major Fed move correctly over the last 16 years. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. Housing Starts Housing starts fell, but building permits went up. This indicates that high interest rates are beginning to reduce immediate demand for housing, but builders remain optimistic for the future. Here are the details: Housing starts came at 1.283M vs. 1.435M consensus. Building permits came at 1.543M vs. 1.442M consensus.

2023-09-20,National Debt Reaches $33 Trillion - Prudent Investors Concerned But Momo Crowd Says Debt Doesn't Matter,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. A Terrible Milestone Reached Please click here for a chart of U.S. national debt. Note the following: The chart shows the accelerating trajectory of the U.S. national debt. The Treasury Department is informing that for the first time, gross national debt has exceeded $33T. The chart shows that about $10T worth of debt has accumulated since the pandemic. The national debt is likely to exceed $50T by the end of the decade if nothing substantial is done. We are politically agnostic. Our sole job is to help investors by being objective. Many federal programs passed by the Biden administration are costing more than expected. Here are two examples: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was supposed to cost about $400B over 10 years. The reality is that it may cost more than $1T. The government simply underestimated the generosity of energy tax credits in the act. The Employee Retention Credit was supposed to cost about $55B. It has already cost $230B. Recently, the IRS froze the program to stop fraud. Estimates are that the Federal government will be paying over $10T in interest over the next decade. For the first 11 months of the fiscal year, the federal deficit stands at $1.5T, a 61% increase over the same period last year. The U.S. national debt equals over $254,000 per taxpayer. In addition to the national debt, the government has unfunded liabilities. These liabilities now total over $193T. This equates to over $577,000 per U.S. citizen. Prudent investors are concerned and are taking into account the rising national debt in their allocation. Momo gurus have convinced the momo crowd that the national debt and unfunded liabilities do not matter. Momo gurus keep urging their followers to ignore the debt and buy stocks. Today is the second day of the Fed meeting. The Fed will announce its rate decision at 2pm ET. Powell’s press conference is at 2:30pm ET. The consensus is no rate hike but a hawkish statement.

For details, please see yesterday’s Morning Capsule. The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade on hope strategy. The narrative from momo gurus is that the stock market will rocket up after the Fed announcement. Even though momo gurus have been consistently wrong, prudent investors pay attention to momo gurus’ narrative because they have a large following, and the momo crowd is often in control of the stock market in the short term.

The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.

2023-09-21,"The New Dot Plot Hits The Stock Market - Here Is What You Need To Know, A Shocker In New Data","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Dot Plot Please click here for the Fed’s new dot plot. Note the following: We previously shared with you that the most important information ahead was the new dot plot. That call has proven spot on. The new dot plot is hitting the stock market with significant selling. The dot plot shows each FOMC participants’ projected midpoint of the target for the federal funds. Each dot represents an FOMC participant. The dot plot shows the highest 2024 projection of 6.125% and the lowest projection of 4.375%. The median projection for 2024 is now 5.1% vs. 4.6% from the prior dot plot that we previously shared with you. Please click here to see the prior dot plot. The dot plot shows the highest projection for 2025 of 5.625% and the lowest projection of 2.625%. The message from the dot plot is that interest rates are going to stay higher for longer. This flies right in the face of projections from momo gurus who have been predicting four rate cuts next year to run up the stock market. In The Arora Report analysis, the dot plot shows one to two rate cuts next year. The stock market has been running up as the majority of market participants have bought into the no landing scenario which is even better than the soft landing scenario. However, Powell is not willing to endorse either the no landing or the soft landing scenario. From yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule: Powell says that a soft landing is the primary objective of the Fed. However, when Powell was prompted to say that a soft landing was a baseline expectation, Powell specifically said that a soft landing is not a baseline expectation. In plain English, baseline expectation means the most likely scenario. The dot plot is in line with The Arora Report projections that have been used in determining the protection band. For this reason, The Arora Report members are already ahead of the game and no action is needed at this time. There is significant uncertainty ahead. Prudent investors should start with Arora’s Second Law of Investing and Trading, which states “Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets.” Follow with Arora’s Third Law, which states “Making investing and trading decisions based on probabilities is the only realistic and profitable approach.” To learn all of Arora’s 30 Laws, please click here. In The Arora Report analysis, here are the probabilities: Recession 45% Soft landing 35% No landing 20% It is important for investors to keep in mind that the stock market is priced for no landing and zero percent probability of a recession. Initial jobless claims this week are a shocker. The jobs picture is stronger than expected. Initial claims came at 201K vs. 225K consensus. Initial claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static.

2023-09-22,Classic Gap Down In Bonds Is Negative For Stocks – Spot On Long-Term Arora Call,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Classic Gap Down Please click here for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT). Note the following: The chart shows a classic gap down in bonds. This is negative for stocks. The chart shows heavy volume on the gap down. This indicates conviction in selling bonds. The chart shows bonds have fallen under the support/resistance zone. This is negative. The chart shows RSI divergence. From a technical perspective, this signals a potential reversal in bonds. Back in 2020, The Arora Report was the first to call that the long bull market in bonds was over and inflation would rise significantly. Remember when The Arora Report made a call that the long bull market in bonds was over, the future was not known. We had no company and the call went squarely against the conventional wisdom as well as the market trend of the last 38 years at that time. In real life, a call does not get bolder than this. Now, with the benefit of hindsight of three years since the call, it is crystal clear that the major call on bonds from The Arora Report was spot on. Earlier, the yield on 10-year Treasuries touched 4.5%. 10-year Treasuries are trading at 4.47% as of this writing. The 10-year yield is used as a reference rate in determining the fair value of the stock market and also in determining the PE of individual stocks. Rising yields mean a lower fair value of the stock market. From a valuation perspective, rising yields are especially harmful to the PEs of long duration stocks. Long duration stocks include tech stocks and speculative stocks. For those who want to take their understanding of the impact of rising yields on their portfolio to the next level, listen to the podcast titled “Be Careful With Popular Long Duration Stocks.” The podcast is available in Arora Ambassador Club. In the early trade, the momo crowd is aggressively buying stocks. They are not buying stocks because any analysis shows stock valuations have become attractive. The momo crowd is simply buying because they have been trained to buy every tiny dip. Also helping the stock market in the early trade is aggressive buying in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. AAPL is the largest stock and carries heavy weight in indexes. AAPL stock is being bought on the launch of the iPhone 15 in retail stores.

Generally, Asian stocks faced a downtrend on Monday, attributed to concerns over increasing interest rates in major markets. Chinese stocks bore the brunt of the impact, primarily due to persisting apprehensions surrounding the real estate sector. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 1.97% to 17,728.00. Eurozone at 06.00 AM ET Europe was predominantly bearish: the STOXX 600 index decreased by 0.53%. Germany's DAX fell by 0.65%. France's CAC 40 by 0.56%.

2023-09-25,"Small Caps Signal Recession Worries, Large Caps Hold Up On AI Frenzy","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Recession Worries Please click here for a chart of iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM). Note the following: The chart shows that small caps have accelerated to the downside and are now far away from the downward sloping trendline. This is negative for the stock market. The chart shows that small caps have now broken below the support/resistance zone shown on the chart. This is negative for the stock market. In contrast to the small caps, large caps are holding up. Here are the reasons for this discrepancy: Small caps are more impacted by a recession than large caps. Large caps are held up by the AI frenzy. The AI frenzy is not helping small caps. Small caps are signaling a recession ahead at a time when the momo crowd believes in no landing. In addition to small caps, there are other troubling signals. The economy has been held up by excessive spending by the consumer. However, consumer defaults on loans are rapidly increasing, as are bankruptcies. In The Arora Report analysis, the liquidity that the consumer has enjoyed is going to become less and less going forward. To add to the troubles, the U.S. government shutdown is looming if both parties cannot come to an agreement. UAW is expanding its strike against General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Stellantis NV (NYSE:STLA). If the strike is prolonged, it will have a negative impact on the stock market. Global trade is falling at the fastest rate since 2020. This has a negative economic impact. Worries about the Chinese property sector are resurfacing causing stocks in Hong Kong to fall 1.8%. On the positive side, there is excitement about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) investing $4B in AI startup Anthropic. Amazon is trying to follow the same play Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) made with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. OpenAI uses Microsoft’s Azure platform. Anthropic will use Amazon’s AWS cloud platform. Anthropic will also use AI chips from Amazon. In the early trade, this is having a negative impact on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Even though a fortune is to be made in AI over the next seven years, this illustrates that, at times, it will be treacherous. It is important to completely follow The Arora Report system to minimize risks and maximize returns in AI. It is especially important to follow the Trade Management Guidelines and not get carried away with enthusiasm about AI.

2023-09-26,"Market Mechanics Taking Over, Window Dressing Meets Higher Rates","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Window Dressing Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX). Note the following: The chart shows that the stock market has pulled back to the top band of the top support zone. The chart shows that the stock market is tracing a head and shoulders pattern. This is a negative pattern about 70% of the time. RSI on the chart shows that the stock market is oversold. Oversold markets tend to bounce. There was aggressive buying in stocks going into the close yesterday due to a market mechanic known as window dressing. In window dressing, many money managers buy the best performing stocks of the quarter and sell the laggards. In this quarter, it means buying the Magnificent Seven stocks and other artificial intelligence stocks. We have been receiving requests for a podcast on window dressing. We have started work on the podcast. The podcast will be available in Arora Ambassador Club. Market mechanics play a much greater role in market movements than most investors realize. Market mechanics impact both short term traders and long term investors. As a reference, about two thirds of the stock market rise this year is attributable to market mechanics. This morning, the market mechanic of window dressing is meeting higher yields. Higher yields are especially negative for tech stocks. These are the same tech stocks that money managers are buying in window dressing. This morning, selling due to higher yields is getting an upper hand over buying due to window dressing. In The Arora Report analysis, if it was not for window dressing, yesterday and today Nasdaq would have likely been down 2 - 3%. The consensus in the market is that a government shutdown in Washington will be averted. However, prudent investors need to stay alert to a potential government shutdown. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. China Property debt situation is getting worse in China. One of the largest property developers in China, Evergrande Group, failed to make payments on an on-shore bond. Evergrande’s stock fell about 25%. An ex-CEO and ex-CFO of the company have been arrested by the Chinese government. These developments are casting a negative shadow on stocks across the globe.

The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.

2023-09-28,"King Dollar Getting In The Way Of Momo Stock Gurus, China, And Russia","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. King Dollar Please click here for a chart of the Invesco DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSE:UUP). Note the following: The chart shows when The Arora Report’s Morning Capsule headline read “MOMO GURUS PREDICT DEMISE OF DOLLAR BULL RUN, CHINA DATA TEMPERS ENTHUSIASM FOR STOCKS.” Momo gurus were thrilled as the dollar had been falling going into July 17, 2023. On the morning of July 17, 2023, there was a unanimous chorus that the dollar was about to fall out of bed. We wrote: The chorus of momo guru predictions that the dollar bull run has ended is picking up steam again. Momo gurus are always trying to drive the dollar lower. The reason is that momo gurus’ real job is to run up the stock market in the short term. We previously wrote: S&P 500 companies derive significant revenue from overseas. When overseas profits are converted into dollars, the profits go up when the dollar is weaker. For this reason, a weak dollar helps the stock market go up in the short term. Momo gurus are not concerned about the long term. In sharp contrast, the mission of The Arora Report is to help members maximize the money they make over their lifetimes. We previously wrote: In the long term, a weaker dollar is not good for the U.S. A strong currency is the hallmark of a strong country. The chart shows the power of Arora support zones and Arora calls. The chart shows that the Arora call coincides with the low in the dollar. The chart shows that the Arora support zone worked as intended. The trendline on the chart shows that the dollar has gone straight up since July 17. Prudent investors should note that the dollar has gone up during a period in which China and Russia put in the most intense, unprecedented efforts to drive the dollar lower. Russia and China are now fully aligned on the objective of China replacing the U.S. as the world’s number one superpower. China and Russia understand that a big part of the strength of the U.S. is the king dollar. The U.S. military is strong. The best way for China and Russia to dethrone the U.S. is to drive the dollar lower. Q2 GDP - Third Estimate came 2.1% vs. 2.1% consensus. Initial jobless claims came at 204K vs. 215K consensus. This is very strong data indicating that the jobs picture is staying strong. Initial jobless claims are a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change. Stock futures were down earlier this morning, but the momo crowd bought aggressively ahead of the economic data, as is their pattern. Stock futures dipped when jobless claims came much better than expected. As of this writing, the momo crowd is aggressively buying the dip. There are two important earnings that have an impact on the entire stock market. The large semiconductor company Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) guided lower as companies are spending more money on AI chips and not on conventional memory chips. Micron is working on a high bandwidth memory chip for AI, but it will not be available until 2024. The stock is down 3.8% as of this writing. We have been sharing with you that a fortune is to be made in artificial intelligence, but it will take expertise. The large used car deal CarMax, Inc (NYSE:KMX) reported that comparable store used unit sales fell 9% year-over-year. The stock is down 12.2% as of this writing in the premarket, even though this is one of the stocks that is supposed to benefit if the UAW strike prolongs. According to the St. Louis Federal Reserve, credit card delinquency rate in Q2 was 2.8%. For reference, compare it to 2.6% delinquency rate in the Q4 2019 just before the pandemic hit and 6.8% in Q2 2009 during the great financial crisis. In The Arora Report analysis, the foregoing credit card data is backward looking. Investors should focus on leading indicators. Consumers are charging more and getting closer to their credit card limits. This may lead to higher delinquencies in the future. This is an important piece of data since the U.S. economy is about 70% consumer based and the recession has been postponed, in part, due to excessive consumer spending.

2023-10-02,"October Is The Most Volatile Month Of The Year – AI Frenzy To Be Tested, Fed Speak, Bitcoin Squeeze","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Volatility Ahead Please click here for a chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX). Note the following: The government shutdown is averted for now. The can has been kicked down the road until November 17. Sunday evening, when futures opened, the momo crowd bought aggressively on the government not shutting down. However, as of this writing, futures have not only given up their gains but have turned negative. The chart shows the stock market is in the top support zone. In The Arora Report analysis, the stock market is waiting for a trigger to move out of the top support zone. In The Arora Report analysis, October is likely to test the enthusiasm for AI stocks. October is historically the most volatile month of the year. Stock market crashes tend to happen in October. Often, October lays the groundwork for the market mechanic for year end chase to drive the stock market higher in November and December. However, keep in mind that in some years like 2022, the chase is to the downside. When investors develop in-depth knowledge of market mechanics, it gives them an edge. About two thirds of the market rise this year has been due to market mechanics. For those wanting next-level information, a podcast titled “Market Mechanics: Gain An Edge From Year End Chase” is in post-production. The podcast will be available in Arora Ambassador Club. The year end chase being to the upside or to the downside this year will largely depend on the following: Upcoming earnings Momentum in AI stocks New economic data Interest rates November FOMC meeting RSI on the chart shows that the stock market remains oversold. Oversold markets tend to bounce. ISM Manufacturing Index is to be released at 10am ET. The consensus is 47.8%. If the actual number released is far from the consensus, it will move the stock market. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM), is speaking at 10am ET. In The Arora Report analysis, Dimon’s speech is important. As the head of the largest U.S. bank, he has great visibility into the state of the economy. Dimon recently warned about higher interest rates and lower bonds. His warning was in line with one of The Arora Report scenarios but not in line with the consensus in the stock market. Prudent investors should carefully watch to see what he says about interest rates. Fed speak is ahead and maybe market moving: Powell and Harker are participating in a roundtable at 11am ET. Mester is speaking at 7:30pm ET. Today is the beginning of the fourth quarter. Blind money flows into Wall Street on the first two days of the quarter without any analysis and irrespective of market conditions. Most of blind money is invested in the afternoon. Wall Street front runs the blind money by buying certain stocks in the morning and then selling them to blind money in the afternoon at a profit. Of course, blind money is oblivious because they do not care what price they pay.

When a deal was struck in the house to keep the government open, short sellers jumped in hoping that bitcoin would fall. This is when the whales apparently decided to squeeze the shorts, causing a major run-up. Bitcoin has now moved over $28,000. Markets Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is 🔒. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.

2023-10-03,"Pay Attention: Investors Making Three Classic Mistakes In The Stock Market And Getting Burned, Money Flows In Magnificent Seven","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Three Classic Mistakes Please click here for a chart of Nextera Energy Partners LP (NYSE:NEP). Note the following: The Morning Capsule is about the big picture. The chart of NEP is being used to illustrate the point. NEP is a publicly traded limited partnership that owns interest in wind and solar projects, and natural gas infrastructure. NEP was formed by NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE). The largest asset of NEE is First Trust New Opprtnts MLP & Engy Fd (NYSE:FPL) which is a regulated utility that serves nearly half of Florida and is the third largest electric utility in the country. Both NEE and NEP have been aggressively promoted to investors by Wall Street and newsletters. Both NEE and NEP have been favorite investments of the dividend chasing crowd. Many individual investors have a large proportion of their portfolios in these stocks based on the pump on social media and other sites where the dividend chasing crowd congregates. The anecdotal evidence is that many such investors did not even read Wall Street’s analysis. There is also anecdotal evidence that many such investors do not even have rudimentary risk control. The chart shows that NEP has fallen from a 52 week high of $81.32 to $24.50. The chart shows that the drop in the stock from the high to about $48 is the first leg. This is due to rising interest rates. The chart shows that there is a second leg showing the stock falling from about $48 to $24.50 in four trading days. The second down leg occurred because NEP lowered its dividend growth rate due to higher interest rates making it unable to accretively add drop-downs from its parent NEE. The stock of the parent NEE has also fallen from the high of almost $90 to about $51. Why were investors buying NEP and NEE? They were chasing yields without understanding the business, the financials, and the impact of interest rates. The last dividend provided them with a 5.8% yield on NEP and 2.51% on NEE. NEE and NEP are not the only stocks. The dividend chasing crowd is getting burned in many stocks. Prudent investors need to make sure they are staying clear of the following mistakes that the dividend chasing crowd has been making. The crowd gets very focused on the dividends without understanding the risks. It is important to pay attention to one of the Arora Principles: give precedence to return of capital over return on capital. This principle becomes especially important when the upside rewards are minimal but downside risks are great. How does a 5% dividend help when trying to get this dividend, an investor loses 72% of the value? The dividend chasing crowd has an answer that they believe in religiously. The answer is that the value of their portfolio does not matter; it is only the income that matters. As foolish as this kind of thinking is, it gets even worse for the dividend chasing crowd because ultimately dividends get cut. The second classic mistake is this crowd does not keep up with the changing macro environment. The easiest and most time efficient way to keep up with the macro environment is to regularly read the Morning Capsules. The third classic mistake this crowd makes is that for information, they rely on those who have an agenda without understanding that their information sources are not objective. The vast majority of this crowd does not subscribe to an objective resource such as The Arora Report. The momo crowd was running up stock futures earlier today until yields started rising again and smart money started selling. As of this writing, smart money selling has overwhelmed momo crowd buying. It is important to note that smart money holds large equity positions. Smart money is not selling wholesale, but rather trimming at the edges.

2023-10-04,Major Buying Opportunity In The Stock Market Ahead Only If This Market Mechanic Kicks To The Upside,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Major Buying Opportunity Ahead Please click here for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT). Note the following: The chart shows that The Arora Report call that was made on August 2 was very timely and spot on. The chart shows the dramatic drop in TLT. The chart shows that the volume on the drop yesterday was a record. In The Arora Report analysis, this is one indication of potential capitulation. In general, it pays to buy when a capitulation occurs. However, this is only one of the several important capitulation indicators. For those wanting next-level information, listen to the podcast in Arora Ambassador Club titled “The Ten Secrets Of Epic Capitulation Riches.” RSI on the chart shows that TLT is oversold and beginning to bounce. This indicates that if the macro data is favorable, TLT can move up quickly. In The Arora Report analysis, the short interest in bonds right now is likely the highest ever. Assuming our analysis is correct, if favorable macro data is released, TLT can experience a major short squeeze and run up. In The Arora Report analysis, all of the foregoing is only short term. For the long term, The Arora Report has a negative view of bonds due to high debt levels, high deficits, and persistent inflation. Weak Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP) data this morning is lifting bonds, and in turn, stocks. ADP is the largest private payroll processor in the country. It uses its data to give a glimpse of the jobs picture ahead of the official jobs report that will be released on Friday. ADP employment change came at 89K vs. 150K consensus. There are three pieces of data ahead that can dramatically move TLT, and in turn, the stock market. ISM Non-Manufacturing Index will be released today at 10am ET. The consensus is 53.7. Initial claims will be released at 8:30am ET on October 5. The consensus is 225K. Initial claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change. The jobs report will be released at 8:30am ET on October 6. The consensus for non-farm private payrolls is 150K. The consensus for the headline is 158K. If the economic data is such that the bonds turn up, the market mechanic of year end chase will start kicking in. If this market mechanic turns out to be to the upside, expect a major rally and a buying opportunity in the stock market. There are never any guarantees. For this reason, it is important to stay in tune with the new data as it comes in. Understanding market mechanics can give you a big edge. For example, about two thirds of the market rise this year is due to market mechanics. For those who want next-level information, a podcast titled “Market Mechanics: Gain An Edge From Year End Chase '' will go live in Arora Ambassador Club today.

2023-10-05,"An Oversold Gold Miner With Strong Fundamentals--Its Relative Strength Index Is Below 20, And Its Piotroski F-Score Is 8","Paying Attention To Gold Miners On Zero Hedge on Monday, contributing editor “Quoth The Raven” suggested “paying urgent attention to gold miners”: As everybody knows, one of my favorite assets on the board right now for buying is gold miners. They are completely hated and totally undervalued, without even a semblance of pricing in the potential leverage they could gain from a spike in gold prices. Basically, gold, as tracked by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE:GLD), hasn’t done as well as goldbugs might have expected in an inflationary environment, because rising rates have boosted the dollar, and gold miners, as tracked by the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) have lagged gold. But if you believe the Fed will have to start cutting rates at some point next year, presumably, gold will go up. And when that happens, gold miners will likely go up even more, thanks to their operational leverage, which can turn a double digit increase in the price of gold into a triple digit increase in gold miners’ profits. An Oversold Gold Miner In a recent post, we looked at the power of the technical indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index). A technical indicator to keep in mind for earnings trades. https://t.co/g6zISKkVmc$BIG $SFIX — Portfolio Armor (@PortfolioArmor) September 25, 2023 RSI is a number from 0 to 100 indicating how overbought or oversold a security is. Values over 70 are usually considered overbought, and values below 30 are usually considered oversold. One screen I’ve been looking at recently includes both RSI and the Piotroski F-Score, which is a measure of financial strength on a scale from 0-9, with 9 being best. I run a bearish version of that where I look for stocks with an RSI over 80 and a Piotroski F-Score of 2 or lower, and I run a bullish one where I look for an RSI under 20 and an F-Score of 8 or better. As it happens, a gold miner comes up on this screen, one with an F-Score of 8 and an RSI below 20. Digging Deeper As with all mechanical screens, it’s best to do some further investigation, to eliminate false positives. For example, one of the stocks the bearish version of this screen picks up now is Reata Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RETA) where the RSI looks high because the company was just acquired by Biogen, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). In the case of our gold miner, I found a deep dive on it by an analyst who highlighted a few key facts about it. On the positive side, it has some of the highest margins in the industry, reporting all-in sustaining costs of about $700 per ounce, compared to an estimated industry average about $1,360 per ounce in the period. On the negative side, one of the company’s properties is in a state in Mexico that has some political risk (a history of strikes). Because of that, this analyst wrote he’d want a discount of 35% to his estimate of the miner’s fair value before investing. The stock is trading at a slightly bigger discount to his fair value estimate now, and by using options, we can potentially get it at an even bigger discount. We have a trade teed up to do just that. If you'd like a heads up when it fills, feel free to subscribe to our trading Substack/occasional email list below."
2023-10-05,"Biggest Oil Drop In A Year On Biden Security Plan, Magnificent 7 Stocks Do Not Like The New Data","To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Biden’s Security Plan Please click here for a chart of oil futures. Note the following: The chart shows a big run up in oil. When oil crossed over $90, $100 oil became the consensus in the marketplace. As the chart shows, the $100 consensus caused a short squeeze. As the chart shows, Biden’s security plan for the Middle East started gaining traction, causing the biggest fall in oil in a year. Biden’s security plan calls for Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel in return for a security pact with the U.S. and other major concessions from the U.S. The presumption is that the result will be Saudi Arabia increasing oil production to help lower oil prices. Considering the presidential election is next year, lowering oil prices with Saudi cooperation is high on Biden’s agenda. In The Arora Report analysis, lower oil prices are a positive for the stock market with the exception of oil stocks. The reason is that lower oil prices mean lower inflation. In The Arora Report analysis, Middle East politics is very volatile and there does not seem to be enough support in the U.S. Congress to support the security pact with Saudi Arabia at this time. For these reasons, the fall in oil prices could turn out to be temporary. Weekly initial jobless claims came at 207K vs. 225K consensus. This indicates that the job picture continues to stay very strong. This strong data caused an immediate uptick in yields and turned money flows in the Magnificent Seven stocks lower. This is important because the stock market is being held up due to the strength in the Magnificent Seven stocks based on AI frenzy. Weekly initial jobless claims is a leading indicator and carries heavy weight in our adaptive ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories. In plain English, adaptiveness means that the model changes itself with market conditions. Please click here to see how this is achieved. One of the reasons behind The Arora Report’s unrivaled performance in both bull and bear markets is the adaptiveness of the model. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then stop working when market conditions change. The next major data release is the jobs report. The jobs report will be released at 8:30am ET on October 6. The consensus for non-farm private payrolls is 150K. The consensus for the headline is 158K. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. Weight Loss Drugs Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) says that people on weight loss drugs are buying slightly less food. The consensus is beginning to develop that weight loss drugs from Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) are negative for many med-tech stocks, restaurant stocks, alcohol stocks, and food and beverage stocks. If these predictions start coming true, money will rush out of these stocks and will likely go into artificial intelligence stocks. There is a fortune to be made in artificial intelligence over the next seven years, but it will be treacherous at times. Investors who develop in-depth knowledge of investing in artificial intelligence will do better compared to those who do not. The easiest way to develop your knowledge about investing in artificial intelligence is to listen to the podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club.

This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

2023-10-06,Blowout Jobs Report But Expect Momo Gurus To Try To Run Up The Market On Hourly Earnings,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Raise Cash And Hedges Cash and hedges are being raised. Scroll down to the “Protection Band And What To Do Now” section below. Be forewarned that this decision may need to be quickly reversed depending upon the upcoming inflation data and earnings. If the inflation data comes out better than expected and earnings start coming out better than expected, the market mechanic of year end chase will take over. This market mechanic has the potential to run up the stock market by as much as 10% - 15%. You gain an edge when you understand market mechanics. For those interested in next-level information, listen to the podcast titled “Market Mechanics: Gain An Edge From Year End Chase.” The podcast is available in Arora Ambassador Club. Jobs Report Please click here for a chart of S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500. Note the following: The chart shows that the stock market has fallen below the low band of the top support zone. The chart shows that the stock market is now approaching the 200 day moving average. There is nothing special about the 200 day moving average. Why not 180 days or 220 days? However, a legion of people believe in the power of the 200 day moving average, and this average has power because of the blind belief. Expect bulls to make the case that the 200 day moving average is going to act as support and the stock market is going to bounce from here. Expect bears to make the case the stock market is going to break the 200 day moving average and go lower. The chart shows the support zone. The stock market can go to the support zone only if the Fed speak is negative and there are rumors about CPI and PPI next week. PPI will be released on October 11. CPI will be released on October 12. The jobs report is extremely strong with the exception of average hourly earnings. Here are the details: Non-farm payrolls came at 336K vs. 158K consensus. Non-farm private payrolls came at 263K vs. 150K consensus. Unemployment rate came at 3.8% vs. 3.7% consensus. Average work week came at 34.4 vs. 34.4 consensus. Average hourly earnings came at 0.2% vs. 0.3% consensus. Investors should note that an increase of 0.2% in average hourly earnings translates to an 2.4% average annual raise. This is at a time when unions are demanding very large raises. The data shows that workers outside of unions are getting raises on the order of about 2%. Yesterday, some momo gurus were predicting a 1000 point DJIA rally. In yesterday’s Afternoon Capsule, we wrote: Start with Arora’s second law: Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next in the markets. Momo gurus do not have any special knowledge or information. They are simply doing their job of getting their followers excited to buy stocks. What are momo gurus going to do now that they were so wrong? Momo gurus are often wrong, so this is nothing new. They still insist on claiming to know that they know what is going to happen next. Even though their gurus are wrong most of the time, the momo crowd continues to follow them. None of this is going to change. Expect momo gurus to come up with a new narrative around an annualized wage increase of 2.4% to try to run up the stock market. Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM) is rumored to be in advanced talks to buy Pioneer Natural Resources Co (NYSE:PXD) for $60B. Such a large buyout has the potential to generate excitement in the stock market and run several oil stocks up.
