These IPOs enter a heavily mixed market as the S&P 500 swung between green and red after the employment situation improved but concerns over Russia and Ukraine hung overhead. Ares Management Facing weak demand, the company decreased its offering from 18.2 million shares to 11.4 million and priced at $19, below the $21-$23 range. Shares opened low, for $18.15 per share at 9:50 a.m. After one minute, the bottom was in at $18, and despite a sluggish market, shares marched to the highs of the day, $18.63.

The change didn't make a difference for the biotechnology company, as shares sank from its open to close an hour later at $7.20, well above its $6.01 low. Scynexis Finally making its debut--Scynexis was originally slated to debut the week of April 14--opened for trading. The stock priced 6.2 million shares at the expected $10 price. Below the offering, the stock opened for $9.75 at 11:19 a.m. In early trading, shares spiked to $9.84 before drifting off for the rest of the day to close at $9.00.

2014-11-24,The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism Publishes Radius Health's Phase II Study Of The Investigational Drug Abaloparatide In Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis,"Radius Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: RDUS) announced today that results from a multi-center, multi-national, double-blind placebo controlled Phase 2 trial evaluating the effects of the investigational drug abaloparatide on bone mineral density (BMD) were published online for early release on November 13, 2014, ahead of print by the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (JCEM) [doi:10.1210/jc.2014-3718]. The investigational drug abaloparatide is a synthetic peptide analog of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) currently being developed as an anabolic agent for potential use in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The Phase 2 study evaluated the effects of three different doses of abaloparatide on bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck in 222 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis against placebo and an active comparator, teriparatide. The main outcome measures were BMD by dual x-ray absorptiometry and biochemical markers of bone turnover. In the Phase 2 study, 24-weeks of abaloparatide was observed to increase BMD in a dose-dependent manner and to a greater extent than placebo at the lumbar spine (p<.001), femoral neck (p=.036), and total hip (p=.007). The BMD changes observed in the very limited population enrolled in the extension study (7-14 subjects per treatment arm) suggest that the BMD increases with abaloparatide remain relatively linear during the first year of treatment. The Company's Phase 3 clinical trial (ACTIVE) evaluating the investigational drug abaloparatide-SC for potential use in the reduction of fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis has completed last patient, last visit, and the company plans to announce the top-line, 18-month fracture data in late December 2014. President and CEO, Robert Ward, stated, The encouraging results being published in the current issue of JCEM support the continued development of abaloparatide as an anabolic therapy for potential use in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. We look forward to announcing the top-line 18-month fracture data from our Phase 3 ACTIVE study in late December 2014. The potential clinical significance, if any, of these data is being evaluated in Radius' ongoing Phase III clinical trial and is subject to regulatory review of the complete data set on this investigational drug."

2014-12-30,The Top IPO Of 2014,"Now that 2014 is winding down, it's a good time to look at the best IPOs of the year. There were plenty of IPO winners this year, but only one company can lay claim to the title of best IPO of 2014. Best IPO: Radius Health (+370%) Despite the massive size and all the press surrounding the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) IPO, the honors of best IPO of 2014 go to Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ: RDUS). Radius Health, a developer of treatments for osteoporosis and other women’s heath conditions, went public back on June 9. After IPO shares priced at $8.00, the first day of trading was relatively uneventful. IPO investors saw the stock close up just a penny to $8.01 on the stock’s first day on the market. Related Link: The Biggest REIT Story Of 2014 However, Radius Health started gaining momentum in the weeks following the IPO, and the stock never looked back. Radius Health recently peaked as high as $42.57 last week before pulling back to its current price of $37.67. This price represents a 370 percent gain from the IPO price. Investors that weren’t lucky enough to get in on the Radius Health IPO but acted quickly on its first day of trading have enjoyed similar gains this year. These incredible gains are more than enough to earn Radius Health the distinction of best-performing IPO of the year 2014. Runner Up: Auspex Pharmaceuticals (+218%) This year’s runner up for best IPO goes to small-cap biotech stock Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: ASPX). The company is focused on developing novel treatments for orphan diseases. After pricing its February 5 IPO at $12.00, the high end of the projected range, Auspex stock opened for trading at $15.00 and closed its first day at $15.66. The stock steadily climbed throughout the rest of the year, but it leaped from around $25.00 to over $50.00 a couple of weeks ago on news of positive results from a Huntington’s disease treatment study.

2014-12-30,The Top IPO of 2014,"Now that 2014 is winding down, it's a good time to look at the best IPOs of the year. There were plenty of IPO winners this year, but only one company can lay claim to the title of best IPO of 2014. Best IPO: Radius Health (+370%) Despite the massive size and all the press surrounding the Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) IPO, the honors of best IPO of 2014 go to Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ: RDUS). Radius Health, a developer of treatments for osteoporosis and other women’s heath conditions, went public back on June 9. After IPO shares priced at $8.00, the first day of trading was relatively uneventful. IPO investors saw the stock close up just a penny to $8.01 on the stock’s first day on the market. Related Link: The Biggest REIT Story Of 2014 However, Radius Health started gaining momentum in the weeks following the IPO, and the stock never looked back. Radius Health recently peaked as high as $42.57 last week before pulling back to its current price of $37.67. This price represents a 370 percent gain from the IPO price. Investors that weren’t lucky enough to get in on the Radius Health IPO but acted quickly on its first day of trading have enjoyed similar gains this year. These incredible gains are more than enough to earn Radius Health the distinction of best-performing IPO of the year 2014. Runner Up: Auspex Pharmaceuticals (+218%) This year’s runner up for best IPO goes to small-cap biotech stock Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: ASPX). The company is focused on developing novel treatments for orphan diseases. After pricing its February 5 IPO at $12.00, the high end of the projected range, Auspex stock opened for trading at $15.00 and closed its first day at $15.66. The stock steadily climbed throughout the rest of the year, but it leaped from around $25.00 to over $50.00 a couple of weeks ago on news of positive results from a Huntington’s disease treatment study. The current price of $49.79 represents about a 218 percent gain for IPO investors. Investing in IPOs can be a risky game, but, as investors in these two 2014 IPOs can attest, sometimes the payoff is fast and huge. Check back on Benzinga for the worst-performing IPO of 2014."

2015-06-01,Radius Health Announces Engagement With Myrtle Potter & Company for Development of Abaloparatide Commercialization Strategy,"Radius Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: RDUS), a science-driven biopharmaceutical company developing novel differentiated therapeutics for patients with advanced osteoporosis as well as other serious endocrine-mediated diseases including metastatic breast cancer, today announced that it has engaged Myrtle Potter & Company, LLC. to support the development of the future global commercial strategy for its lead investigational drug abaloparatide-SC for the potential treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis. We are pleased to have the benefit of Myrtle Potter & Company's track record and experience as we prepare to transition Radius from a development stage company to a fully integrated commercial entity. We believe this collaboration will accelerate our disease-awareness efforts to transform the understanding of osteoporosis, which, over the longer term, could help improve the treatment of patients with incident osteoporotic fractures, said Radius Health CEO, Robert E. Ward. Myrtle and her team's commercial expertise will be a valuable addition to our already strong leadership as we advance our investigational new drug abaloparatide-SC towards regulatory submissions later this year in the U.S. and the EU and prepare for our first potential commercial launch. In June 2015, Radius expects to report the topline 6 month results from the Phase 3 ACTIVExtend trial. These results from ACTIVExtend will be combined with the already completed Phase 3 ACTIVE trial to provide the 24 month data set to be submitted this year to the FDA as a portion of the new drug application (NDA) for abaloparatide-SC. In December 2014, Radius reported that our Phase 3 (ACTIVE) study evaluating abaloparatide-SC met the primary endpoint (86% reduction in new vertebral fractures versus placebo) as well as key secondary endpoints (43% reduction in non-vertebral fractures versus placebo). Radius is on track for NDA submission to the FDA and MAA submission to EMA by year-end. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and the National Bone Health Alliance (NBHA) have highlighted the critical need to improve the screening, diagnosis and treatment for the estimated 2 million Americans who suffer osteoporotic fractures each year. Osteoporosis remains a major unmet medical need as NHBA reports a treatment gap that may impact as many as 80% of these cases. We have a long history of working with pharmaceutical and biotech companies to maximize the commercial value of their innovative products, said Myrtle Potter, CEO. We are eager to work with Radius as they seek to launch the first new therapy in many years into the large and growing osteoporosis market, particularly as it may have the potential to benefit the large number of patients at risk of non-vertebral fractures for whom there remains a significant unmet medical need. Founded in 2005 by Myrtle Potter, Myrtle Potter & Company specializes in devising novel strategies to maximize the value of prescription drug brands and portfolios. Prior to founding Myrtle Potter & Company, Myrtle was president and chief operating officer of Genentech for five years, where she led the company's launch of seven products, including the blockbuster cancer therapy Avastin™. Prior to that, Myrtle was president of Bristol-Myers Squibb's $4 billion U.S. Cardiovascular and Metabolic business and led the launch of four drugs, including Plavix™, Pravachol™ and Glucophage™."

2015-07-13,Did Anyone Notice Sucampo's Breakout?,"Breakouts. Everybody wants them, but not everyone can find them. Stocks that break through key levels of resistance are usually sending a signal that higher prices are coming. Many a great run started at the point of a strong resistance breakout point. The difficulty for most investors and traders is isolating stocks that have those clear breakout points. A Look Back Take for example Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ: RDUS). From the end of January until the beginning of June, Radius had established a strong level of resistance at $50. Once the stock broke through that level in mid-June, it was off to the races for the stock. Related Link: Regal Entertainment Stock Has $11 Upside On Breakout Box Office Another example would be Agenus Inc (NASDAQ: AGEN). For about two months, Agenus was stalling at $5.75, but toward the end of April, the stock finally popped through that mark. That breakout led to a high of around $10/share, a run up of about 80 percent a share. So, the question now is finding a stock that is getting ready to break out. Take a look at Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: SCMP). Over the past two months, Sucampo has hit a wall at $17.50 on three separate occasions. However, on Friday, the stock finally busted through that level and seems poised to run higher. Obviously, investors must conduct their own due diligence before investing in any security, but stocks breaking through key areas of resistance are the ones that commonly run higher.

2015-11-17,Radius Health Has Submitted a Marketing Authorization Application for the Investigational Drug Abaloparatide-SC for the Treatment of Postmenopausal Osteoporosis in Europe,"Radius Health (Nasdaq: RDUS), today announced that it has submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for an investigational, once-daily subcutaneous injection of abaloparatide, a novel synthetic peptide. In addition to other data, the MAA is supported by clinical studies exploring the use of abaloparatide for the treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, including the pivotal 18-month ACTIVE study which enrolled 2463 women. The announcement is being made during the Company's Investor Day meeting being held today in New York City. Today marks a major milestone for Radius Health with the submission of our MAA in Europe for the investigational drug abaloparatide-SC for the potential treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. said Robert E. Ward, President and CEO of Radius Health. This is the first step towards achieving our goal to make abaloparatide available to patients around the world who are suffering from the burden of osteoporosis. At Investor Day, Radius Management discussed the Company's latest progress and plans for the further development and, subject to receipt of approval following positive regulatory review, commercialization of abaloparatide, RAD1901 and RAD140. A replay of the webcast of the Company's presentation will be available on the Company's website approximately two hours following the completion of the event. Abaloparatide Following the completion and reporting of the positive top line results for the Phase 3 ACTIVE trial and the first six months of ACTIVExtend, Radius has now submitted the MAA for the investigational drug abaloparatide-SC in the EU. The Company is now turning its focus to the completion of the work streams necessary for the submission of the New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for the investigational drug abaloparatide-SC. For the MAA, the Company has submitted 6-month stability data for abaloparatide in accordance with European requirements. As additional data become available, they will be submitted in support of our targeted 3-year shelf life for the commercial product following receipt of regulatory approval. In the US, the FDA requires that 12-month stability data be submitted at the time of the NDA. The 12-month time point for the abaloparatide stability samples will be reached in December 2015 and Radius expects to initiate data analysis in January 2016. To accommodate this analytic plan, the Company announced a change in the NDA submission timing to the end of the first quarter of 2016. Similar to the European submission, as additional stability data become available they will be submitted in support of Radius' targeted 3-year shelf life for the commercial product following receipt of regulatory approval. The Company believes that the stability data supporting both the MAA submission and the planned NDA submission will be sufficient to meet the regulatory standards for approval. Radius plans to commence a clinical evaluation for an optimized abaloparatide transdermal patch by the end of 2015. Radius confirmed that partnership discussions regarding abaloparatide commercialization are ongoing and that the Company expects to announce a partnership by the time of first commercial launch. Radius Health's ideal partner for abaloparatide would have experience in the development and commercialization of therapeutics to treat osteoporosis and related bone metabolic disorders. The Company reviewed the high unmet medical need associated with osteoporosis noting that, according to the International Osteoporosis Foundation, there is an osteoporosis-related fracture every three seconds worldwide. A Mayo Clinic paper published in 2015 estimates that the number of days of hospitalization related to osteoporotic fractures is significantly greater than the days of hospitalization for myocardial infarction, stroke, or breast cancer. RAD1901 The investigational drug RAD1901, a selective estrogen receptor degrader, is currently being studied for potential use in metastatic breast cancer. Despite the introduction of new treatment options for metastatic breast cancer patients over the past decade, there remains a significant unmet medical need and a high rate of treatment resistance across first and second line therapies. Radius believes that a once-daily oral therapy such as the investigational drug RAD1901 may hold the potential to provide an important option as a single agent for overcoming endocrine resistance and to offer a profile well suited for use in combination therapy as well. Upcoming milestones for RAD1901 are: Radius plans to provide an update on the ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation study in metastatic breast cancer patients at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2015. Radius expects to initiate an additional Phase I clinical trial in metastatic breast cancer patients in the European Union in December 2015. Radius intends to commence a Phase 2b trial for low-dose RAD1901 for vasomotor symptoms in December 2015. RAD140 The investigational drug RAD140, a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator, or SARM, is currently in preclinical development as a potential treatment for breast cancer. The androgen receptor (AR) is highly expressed in many estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers. Radius expects to commence a Phase 1 trial for the investigational drug RAD140 after making an Investigational New Drug (IND) submission in 2016."

2016-02-24,Why Did Jefferies Downgrade Radius Health?,"Jefferies' Eun K. Yang downgraded the rating on Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ: RDUS) from Buy to Hold, with a price target of $37. Yang has moved to the sidelines, given that the approvability of abaloparatide-SC is already priced into the stock and significant upside from the current levels is unlikely. The share price has appreciated about 25 percent on not so strong Phase 3 romo data on abalo. Checks with osteoporosis experts reveal that they do not see any meaningful difference among anabolic drugs, since none of them are able to reduce the hip fractures. Despite competitor romosozumab Ph3 data not as strong as RDUS' abaloparatide-SC, osteoporosis experts don't seem to view abalo as more competitive than room, Yang said. On the other hand, experts also do not see any risk to the FDA approval of romo, with the analyst expecting the drug candidate to replace Forteo if it is priced at parity, given that room might be easier to sell to patients due to little or no out-of-pocket cost and lower frequency of injection. Experts continue to view romo as a more likeable/user-friendly anabolic vs. abalo or Forteo, particularly as a bridge to Prolia which physicians like considerably, Yang mentioned. Given that abalo lacks any practical advantages over room and has little differentiation versus Forteo, the analyst expects abalo to capture 16 percent share of the anabolic market."
2016-03-31,Radius Health's Overhangs Were Just Removed: Buy Time,"The filing of NDA for Abaloparatide-SC removes a key overhang on the shares of Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ: RDUS), according to Cantor Fitzgerald. Radius Health announced that it has submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for abaloparatide–SC 80 mcg, an investigational, once daily treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, according to the press release. The brokerage said the U.S. filing has been of particular focus since the decision to delay the NDA filing by a quarter was announced in November 2015. What once created an overhang on the shares can now go away. Related Link: Valeant Credit Analysts Disagreed About Its Debt Earlier This Month Looking At The Overhangs We view the NDA filing as an opportunity for the shares to trade on fundamentals since the filing and competitive concerns have been alleviated, in our view, analyst Mara Goldstein wrote in a note to clients. We like Radius for the opportunity for abaloparatide-SC to take share from Forteo, with the remainder of the pipeline and other strategic initiatives offering upside, the analyst added. On the competitive overhang, Goldstein said, We think concerns regarding Amgen's romosozumab ('romo') have also been an overhang on the shares, as a potential competitor to abaloparatide-SC. However, with a broader data set on romosuzumab emerging (vertebral versus non-vertebral fractures) and the fact that abaloparatide-SC will likely target a different physician community, we think this overhang will continue to ebb. The analyst thinks that the remaining overhang on the shares is the question of partnership or the possibility of acquisition. We think the market assumes that a partnership preempts the possibility of acquisition, which may not necessarily be the case based on other deals in biopharma sector. Nonetheless a commercial partner for ex-U.S. territories is likely, in our view, to be the last overhang on shares, Goldstein added. Shares of Radius Health were down roughly 4 percent at $31.55. Goldstein has a Buy rating and $70 price target on the stock. Image Credit: Public Domain"

(Nasdaq: RDUS) revealed that the FDA has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) for abaloparatide–SC. According to the company, the acceptance of the NDA reflected the regulator's determination that the application was sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Radius Health said that the NDA was supported by data from the complete abaloparatide-SC development program. That included the results from the 18-month Phase 3 ACTIVE trial in 2,463 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and the first six months of the ACTIVExtend trial in 1,139 of the ACTIVE participants. The company added that positive results for abaloparatide-SC treatment groups from the ACTIVE and ACTIVExtend studies have met the primary, as well as, the secondary endpoints essential for submission of the NDA. That included the primary endpoint of reduction of vertebral fractures and key endpoints of reduction of nonvertebral, clinical, and major osteoporotic fractures. In these and the other studies submitted in the NDA, abaloparatide-SC administered at a dose of 80 mcg daily was generally safe and well tolerated in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Radius Health President and CEO, Robert Ward, commented, The FDA's acceptance for filing of our abaloparatide-SC NDA is a major milestone for Radius and we look forward to continuing to work with the FDA as they review our application. Given the high unmet medical need in osteoporosis, we believe that abaloparatide-SC, if approved, has the potential to become a promising new treatment option for the approximately 10 million postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, many of whom remain untreated. The company indicated that Abaloparatide-SC was an investigational treatment for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and its safety and efficacy were not established.

2017-05-22,Amgen News Has Major Readthrough For Radius Health,"Canaccord Genuity analyst John Newman maintains his Buy rating and price target of $85 on Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS). Newman stated, “We continue to believe that RDUS' Tymlos will become an important therapy in the osteoporosis market, increasing shareholder value. We also believe that a transdermal formulation will eventually reach the market, increasing share and treatment duration, as well as creating an extremely high barrier to entry for potential generic competition.” What Amgen Means For Radius Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) and UCB recently reported a cardiovascular imbalance for their antibody, romosozumab, in their Phase 3 ARCH study in osteoporosis. Specifically, Newman stated Amgen cited “a higher rate of positively adjudicated cardiovascular Serious Adverse Events (SAEs).” This imbalance makes FDA approval much more unlikely for romosozumab which will reduce competition for Radius’ drug according to Newman. Newman also pointed out that Tymlos is much more efficient compared to romosozumab. Amgen’s nonvertebral fracture reduction rate of 19 percent was much lower than Tymlos’ rate of 43 percent. Additionally, the reported vertebral fracture reduction for romosozumab was 50 percent versus Tymlos’ 86-percent rate. Further, the treatment time is six months shorter for Tymlos. Finally, Neman believes RAD-1901, a drug being developed as a potential treatment for breast cancer, is showing a lot of promise in production. Newman considers the drug to be a meaningful asset and stated, “RAD-1901 will show meaningful efficacy in breast cancer and that details for a pivotal program may lie ahead.” Radius Health Inc. was trading up almost 13 percent in the pre-market Monday at $39.42.

2017-07-21,Apparently Fake Press Release Roils Radius Health Investors,"Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS) shareholders might have had a confusing intraday session Friday as shares plunged about 10 percent on no definitive news.

By the close of Friday's session, shares were down only 0.3 percent. As the price action unfolded, Benzinga began digging for some justification. Around 2:58 p.m. EDT, traders began circulating an apparent GlobeNewswire press release coming from the company. The press release dated July 21, 2017, described, in some arguably rocky language, the fact that Radius would be holding a conference call on the same date to discuss an unexpected loss. Benzinga wasn't the only source to notice some strange elements of the release, as a handful of investors took to social and voiced their opinion that something fishy might be going on. Aside from some clear grammar errors, Benzinga was able to confirm, upon dialing the number for the conference line, the event listed in the press release was already held on May 24. Additionally, Radius Health's corporate website doesn't include any mention of this conference call. Upon calling Radius Health's main line, a receptionist answered and said she hadn't heard about any conference happening on Friday. Another important item to note with this story and this stock: shortsqueeze.com shows Radius Health's current short interest around 20 percent, a relatively high level of short interest."

2018-01-29,"Analyst: Radius Health Could Advance 50% With Osteoporosis Treatment, Breast Cancer Pipeline","Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS) has multiple catalysts that could drive near-term upside in the shares of the company, according to Morgan Stanley. Radius Health is an integrated biopharma company that specializes in therapies for osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases. The Analyst Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison initiated coverage of the company with an Overweight rating and a $57 price target. The Thesis Radius is set to launch Tymlos, a bone builder for women with osteoporosis, Harrison said in a Monday note. Despite Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY)'s presence in the market with Forteo, which fetched the company $1 billion in sales and is exposed to generic competition in 2019, Harrison said Tymlos' pricing is 40 percent lower than Forteo's — and convenience could help it grab share. Key factors such as formulary wins with Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ:ESRX) (9-12 percent of the market) and growing Medicare coverage (39 percent moving to 50-percent-plus in 2018) will accelerate the launch into 2H18, the analyst said. Unlike the prevalent injectable therapies, the Radius patch could drive market growth, Harrison said. He estimates Radius could achieve 50 percent market share at peak, with $1 billion in peak sales in the late 2020s. If the patch form of Tymlos succeeds, the analyst said the company can achieve $2 billion in peak sales, driving almost a four-fold potential return on Radius. The consensus estimates for Radius have yet to account for the potential of elacestrant, a new agent for women who have not found success with prior breast cancer treatment, Harrison said. The Price Action Radius Health shares are down over 10 percent over the past year. Shares were up 3.07 percent at the time of publication Monday at $39.93.

2018-03-31,Leerink's Takeaways From CNBC's 'Healthy Returns' Conference,"The CNBC Healthy Returns Conference recently came to an end, and Leerink analyst Ana Gupte summarized the key takeaways from the event in a note on Thursday. Here’s what investors need to know: According to venture capital and private equity investors, one of the largest investment opportunities in the health care space is gene therapy for the treatment of cancer, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease. Gupte also said the health care services industry is exploding in size and scope. A panel of experts said Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will likely take one of three paths in health care: become an aggregator of current products and services, completely disrupt the current supply chain structure or provide the underlying technology for the next generation of health care. CIGNA Corporation (NYSE:CI) CEO David Cordani discussed his vision for the future of the company. “An open architecture, collaborative network approach is preferred rather than one specific, owned care delivery model,” Gupte said. Technology can provide new means of diagnosis and treatment. For example, virtual reality therapy is being tested for acute and chronic pain management. Modern medicine and technology is on the brink of dramatically expanding the human life expectancy, driven my new early detection methods for deadly conditions. Leerink analyst Bradley Canino also initiated coverage of Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS) on Thursday with an Outperform rating and $53 price target. “Tymlos is off to a promising start, and the company is advancing a unique and proprietary transdermal patch version of the medicine,” Canino wrote.

Insiders at a biotech took advantage of a secondary offering this past week. Several retailers saw notable insider purchases as well. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10-percent owners only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and want to profit. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly during periods of uncertainty. Here's a look at some notable insider purchases reported in the past week. Intercept Pharmaceuticals Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:ICPT) CEO Mark Pruzanski and three other insiders bought more than 407,000 shares of this New York-based biopharma company early in the week. The share price for the buys was $64, as part of a recently announced secondary offering. The total for the transactions was more than $26.07 million. The largest of the purchases was more than 390,000 shares bought by beneficial owner Genextra S.p.A. Intercept shares rose about 6 percent after the insider buys, but ended the week up about 2 percent at $73.07. The Nasdaq was up less than 1 percent last week.

The latest purchases were part of a passive investment trading plan established late last month. The Pennsylvania-based company posted quarterly results last month and announced a dividend. The stock ended the past week trading at $9.65, about the sam as a week earlier and with no quick gain for Field. from the latest buy. The recent 52-week low was $9.25, but shares have traded as high as $14.53 within the past year.

2019-10-03,Biotech Stock On The Radar: FDA Comes Calling For Pfenex' Osteoporosis Biosimilar,"Pfenex Inc (NYSE:PFNX) has a key binary event coming up: mark your calendar for Oct. 7, when the FDA is scheduled to issue its verdict on the company's lead drug candidate. Through its production platform Pfenex Expression Technology, the biotech Pfenex engages in the development of high-value protein-based therapeutics and vaccines. This thinly traded micro-cap biotech has more than doubled year-to-date. Has the rally run out of steam, or is there further upside ahead? Clinical Pipeline The most advanced product candidate in Pfenex' pipeline, PF708, is inching closer to commercialization. The lead candidate is a therapeutic equivalent of Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY)'s Forteo, which was approved in 2002 to treat osteoporosis in men and menopausal women who are at high risk of fractures. Forteo's global sales stood at $1.6 billion in 2019. Following the midcycle review of Pfenex's NDA for PF708 in May, the FDA did not identify any issues requiring an Adcom meeting, the company said in its second-quarter earnings release. The company is gearing for a commercial launch in the U.S. as early as the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to FDA approval. Pfenex is also striving to get an A therapeutic equivalence designation for PF708 to Forteo, which will allow PF708 to be automatically substituted for Forteo. The company's development and licensing partner Alvogen has assumed the responsibility to manufacture and commercialize PF708 in the U.S. at its own expense. Alvogen has also been granted exclusive rights to market PF708 in the EU, certain countries in the Middle East and North Africa and the rest of the world, excluding those Asian countries for which China NT Pharma has secured the licensing rights. Pfenex is eligible to receive a gross profit split of up to 60% on product sales from Alvogen, depending on the geography and cost of goods sold. The company is eligible for double-digit royalties on net sales from NT Pharma. Alvogen has submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency. Initial comments on the application are expected in the third quarter of 2019. The Pipeline Pfenex's other wholly owned investigational compounds include: -PF582 (randibizumab), a biosimilar candidate to Lucentis marketed by Roche Holdings AG Basel ADR (OTC:RHHBY) and Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), indicated to treat retinal diseases. -PF529, a biosimilar candidate to Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)'s Neulasta for treating chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. -PF690, a biosimilar product to Oncaspar, a drug indicated to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia that's marketed by Shire, which has been acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (NYSE:TAK). -Anthrax vaccine candidates Px563L/RPA563. -Under partnered programs, Pfenex has PF743, a recombinant crisantaspase and PF745, a recombinant crisantaspase with a half-life extension technology, both produced using its PET platform under an agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC (NASDAQ:JAZZ). PF743, which has been named JZP-458, has completed a Phase 1 study successfully, with Jazz aiming to start a Phase 2/3 study later this year. -Pfenex has development and commercial partnerships for CRM-197, a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin, which functions as a carrier for polysaccharides and haptens, making them immunogenic. It has commercial agreements in place with Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and the Serum Institute of India, or SII. Merck is using CRM197 in 12 Phase 3 studies for its V114, an investigational 15-valence conjugate vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal disease. SII has a 10-valence pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Pneumosil, which utilizes CRM197. SII has initiated the process of World Health Organization prequalification for Pneumosil in the first quarter of 2019, with the process likely taking upto a year. See also: Movers And Shakers At ESMO 2019: Immunomedics, G1 Therapeutics, Seattle Genetics And More Competition Apart from the $1.6 billion in sales netted by Eli Lilly, Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS)'s Tymlos, another approved osteoporosis drug, posted sales of $100 million, taking the total sales of osteoporosis drugs to $1.7 billion last year. Pfenex may also have to brace for additional competition, as Evenity developed by Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Belgian biotech UCB has been given the nod in the U.S. for treating osteoporosis in menopausal women at a high risk of fracture, although the EU has yet to approve the drug. Osteoporosis product sales are expected to reach $6.7 billion in the U.S., Japan and the five major European markets by 2025. About 53 million Americans either have osteoporosis or are at increased risk, Pfenex said, citing NIH estimates. Financials Revenue recognized by Pfenex is through collaboration agreements, licensing agreement, government contracts and sales of reagent protein products. A majority of the company's 2018 revenues were derived from its collaboration agreement with Jazz and from its advanced development contract with BARDA, with each accounting for over 10% of its total revenues. Source: 10-Q Filing For the three months ended June 30, 2019, the company reported revenue of $2.81 million, down from $4.19 million year-over-year. The loss per share narrowed from 41 cents to 24 cents, as R&D expenses declined about 55%. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $41.62 million as of June 30. Upcoming Catalysts Oct. 3: Presentation at the Cantor Healthcare Conference. Oct. 7: PDUFA Date For PF708. Commercial launch of PF708: as early as the fourth quarter of 2019 (contingent on FDA approval). Licensee Jazz to initiate Phase 2/3 study of PF743 (JZP-458): later this year. Potential sales royalty payments for the Serum Institute of India's Pneumosal: as early as the first quarter of 2020, when the WHO prequalification process is complete. Stock Take Pfenex, which went public in July 2014 through an 8.33-million-share IPO priced at $6 per share, rose to a post-IPO high of $24.41 in a year. The stock then went downhill, troughing at $2.07 in December 2017 before attempting a modest recovery that took it to a peak of $8.42 in mid-2018. Thereafter, it has been more of a consolidation move. The stock has traded in a 52-week range of $3.13-$10.20. Source: Y Charts From an near-term intraday low of $5.65 on Aug. 5, Pfenex shares rallied to a high of $10.20 on Sept. 17, a peak-trough gain of roughly 81%. The catalyst for the recent rally has been the kickoff of a $17-million development milestone payment from Jazz for PF745. The 50-day SMA has not been violated to the downside by the stock since early August, with the measure currently at $7.448. Buying could emerge if the stock drops back to this level. The $7.20-$7.30 region served as resistance for the stock since the middle of May before buying pushed the stock past this resistance in early September. If this resistance-turned support level breaks down, the next support could be around $5.40-$5.50, a low from which the stock has bounced a few times in recent months. On the contrary, the stock could revisit its recent highs around $9.70-$10.20 on a potentially favorable reaction to the PDUFA catalyst. Pfenex's pipeline optionality and a steady stream of milestone payments from partnered programs and collaborations could cushion the stock even in the wake of an adverse outcome. In early September, JMP Securities analyst Jason Butler upgraded shares of Pfenex from Market Perform to Outperform and raised the price target from $13 to $17, suggesting over 100% upside potential.

2019-12-17,8 Biotech Stocks Morgan Stanley Recommends For 2020,"Biotech investing is risk-fraught, but for investors who make the right bets, the returns can be staggering. As the year draws to a close, Morgan Stanley said stock selection is the key to biotech investing in 2020 as drug pricing and election fears wane, offering incremental upside for innovators. The Analyst Matthew Harrison has the following ratings and price targets for the stocks under his coverage: Bullish Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN): Overweight, $280 price target Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX): Overweight/$250 Alector Inc (NASDAQ:ALEC): Overweight/$27 Fulcrum Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:FULC): Overweight/$29 Sarepta Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SRPT): Overweight/$160 SAGE Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SAGE): Overweight/$125 Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS): Overweight/$36 Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc (NASDAQ:RARE): Overweight/lowered the price target from $76 to $73 Bearish Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:IONS): Underweight/$48 MacroGenics Inc (NASDAQ:MGNX): Underweight/$6 Innoviva Inc (NASDAQ:INVA): Underweight/$8 The Thesis The macro themes for 2020 are likely to be use of cash by large caps, trends in innovation and drug pricing/election risk, the same as in 2019, Harrison said in a Tuesday note. Yet investors are becoming more comfortable with the potential political risks, which is likely to reduce the potential of these risks to create volatility in the sector, the analyst said. See Also: Zynerba Analyst Says Stock A Buy Ahead Of Zygel Data Release In 2020 Large-Cap Picks Among large-cap biotechs, the analyst said he is focusing on growth over value, with Amgen and Vertex being his key calls. Harrison said he sees multiple expansion and positive earnings revisions for Amgen due to a renewed growth outlook, conservative guidance and pipeline optionality. Vertex stock is headed higher in 2020, he said, propelled by a robust launch of triple combo cystic fibrosis drug Trikafta and positive Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency data. SMID-Cap Stocks Poised To Outperform In the SMID space, the analyst likes Alector due to expectations that the Phase 2 dementia data will be a key derisking event. Harrison sees Fulcrum as a key undervalued SMID with pivotal data in a rare muscle disease with $1-billion potential in the third quarter of 2020. For Sarepta, the analyst said pivotal DMD gene therapy data should derisk the bull case. Harrison is positive on Sage on the premise of a return to positive Phase 3 data for major depressive disorder and Phase 3 readouts due in 2020. Ultragenyx is underappreciated, the analyst said. Morgan Stanley expects continued expansion of Crysvita in Latin America, the launch of UX007 and advancement of the gene therapy programs to drive the stock in 2020. For Radius, Harrison forecast stock outperformance due to sustained performance of its osteoporosis drug Tymlos and increased visibility into the Phase 3 study of the abaloparatide patch."

2021-05-06,Radius Health's Earnings: A Preview,"Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS) announces its next round of earnings this Friday, May 07. Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Friday's Q1 earnings announcement. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts are expecting Radius Health's loss per share to be near $0.41 on sales of $60.38 million. Radius Health reported a per-share loss of $0.59 when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $47.92 million. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the consensus estimates; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an earnings surprise, which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. If the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Friday, earnings would be up 30.51%. Sales would be up 25.99% on a year-over-year basis. The company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q4 2021 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate -0.42 -0.21 -0.74 -0.69 EPS Actual -0.23 0.15 -0.67 -0.59 Revenue Estimate 59.86 M 78.38 M 48.40 M 46.26 M Revenue Actual 62.78 M 77.83 M 50.11 M 47.92 M Stock Performance Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 42.48%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders can be content going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Radius Health is scheduled to hold the call at 08:30:00 ET and can be accessed here."

2021-06-20,"The Week Ahead In Biotech: Incyte, Ascendis FDA Decisions, Liver Congress Presentations And 4 IPOs","Biotech stocks came under pressure in the week ended June 18, dragged by the negative sentiment that prevailed in the broader market due to macroeconomic worries. The U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy setting arm — the FOMC — met this week and the key takeaway from the meeting is that after being at a very accommodative level of 0-0.25% ever since the onset of the pandemic, the fed funds target could be hiked as early as 2023. Several stock-specific catalysts also panned out negatively. After Aduhelm approval, Biogen, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) faced multiple clinical trial disappointments, including a failed gene therapy study in choroideremia and stalling of an Alzheimer's trial. High-flying meme stock Orphazyme A S ADR (NASDAQ:ORPH) came crashing down after the Food and Drug Administration slapped a complete response letter for its new drug application for an investigational drug to treat Niemann-Pick disease type C, a rare, progressive, neurodegenerative disease.

(NASDAQ:ETON) and Blueprint Medicines Corp (NASDAQ:BPMC) secured nods for treatments for low blood pressure and advanced systemic mastocytosis, respectively. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (NYSE:TAK) is yet to hear from the FDA on its eosinophilic esophagitis treatment. German vaccine developer CureVac BV (NASDAQ:CVAC), backed by the Gates Foundation, reported disappointing Phase 2/3 results for its vaccine candidate, sending its shares down by over 40% in a single session. The week, however, started with some positive tidings from Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX). The Maryland-based biopharma reported encouraging data from the U.S. leg of the Phase 3 study of its vaccine candidate against the wild coronavirus and variants. The week also witnessed a host of an initial public offering, as IPO news flow resumed after a lull.

2021-09-07,Radius Health Earnings Perspective: Return On Capital Employed,"According to Benzinga Pro data, during Q2, Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS) posted sales of $51.80 million. Earnings were up 11.28%, but Radius Health still reported an overall loss of $11.89 million. Radius Health collected $56.26 million in revenue during Q1, but reported earnings showed a $13.40 million loss. Why Is ROCE Significant? Earnings data without context is not clear and can be difficult to base trading decisions on. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) helps to filter signal from noise by measuring yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q2, Radius Health posted an ROCE of 0.05%. It is important to keep in mind that ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but does not account for factors that could affect earnings and sales in the near future. ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Radius Health is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. For Radius Health, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.05% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Upcoming Earnings Estimate Radius Health reported Q2 earnings per share at $-0.22/share, which beat analyst predictions of $-0.33/share."

2022-05-31,Radius Health's Return On Capital Employed Insights,"Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS) brought in sales totaling $43.16 million during Q1 according to data provided by Benzinga Pro. However, earnings decreased 17.27%, resulting in a loss of $18.28 million. In Q4, Radius Health brought in $65.11 million in sales but lost $15.58 million in earnings. Why Is ROCE Significant? Earnings data without context is not clear and can be difficult to base trading decisions on. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) helps to filter signal from noise by measuring yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q1, Radius Health posted an ROCE of 0.07%. It is important to keep in mind that ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but does not account for factors that could affect earnings and sales in the near future. ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Radius Health is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. For Radius Health, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.07% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Upcoming Earnings Estimate Radius Health reported Q1 earnings per share at $-0.39/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $-0.21/share.

2023-09-14,"Inflation Surges, Consumer Demand Ignites Reflation Trade: Top 5 ETFs Dominating Thursday's Market","Thursday morning was marked by the release of significant economic data for the United States, setting the tone for the trading session. The producer price index rose by 0.7% month-on-month in August, jumping from July’s 0.3% increase and surpassing estimates of 0.4%. This represented the highest monthly price increase for producers since June 2022. Annual inflation among producers reached 1.6%, exceeding economists’ projections of 1.2%. The PPI’s unexpected rise comes on the heels of a higher-than-expected consumer price index report released just a day earlier. August CPI inflation increased to 3.7%, up from 3.2% in July, slightly above the anticipated 3.6%. These elevated figures have raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, as mounting inflation pressures could prompt the Fed to rethink its interest rate path. Despite the reactivation of inflationary pressures, American consumer demand remains strongly robust. August witnessed 0.6% month-on-month growth in retail sales, surpassing July’s 0.5% and beating expectations of 0.2%. This impressive streak marks the fifth consecutive month of rising retail sales. The resilience in consumer spending defies the gravitational pull of inflation and high interest rates, confounding market analysts and policymakers alike. Experts Weigh In On Reflation Phase Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said consumers continue to spend more than anticipated despite the higher interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve now faces a tough task, as data coming in hotter than predicted could put increasing pressure on the central bank to consider raising rates once more at the November meeting, he said. Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, tried to cool down the excitement, stating that retail sales figures are not adjusted for inflation. The expert highlighted that the surge in August retail sales was primarily driven by an increase in gas purchases. When accounting for inflation, the economy shows signs of losing some momentum, although many businesses still enjoyed a strong summer with growing sales.
