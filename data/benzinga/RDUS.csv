2018-01-29,"Analyst: Radius Health Could Advance 50% With Osteoporosis Treatment, Breast Cancer Pipeline","Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS) has multiple catalysts that could drive near-term upside in the shares of the company, according to Morgan Stanley. Radius Health is an integrated biopharma company that specializes in therapies for osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases. The Analyst Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison initiated coverage of the company with an Overweight rating and a $57 price target. The Thesis Radius is set to launch Tymlos, a bone builder for women with osteoporosis, Harrison said in a Monday note. Despite Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE:LLY)'s presence in the market with Forteo, which fetched the company $1 billion in sales and is exposed to generic competition in 2019, Harrison said Tymlos' pricing is 40 percent lower than Forteo's — and convenience could help it grab share. Key factors such as formulary wins with Express Scripts Holding Company (NASDAQ:ESRX) (9-12 percent of the market) and growing Medicare coverage (39 percent moving to 50-percent-plus in 2018) will accelerate the launch into 2H18, the analyst said. Unlike the prevalent injectable therapies, the Radius patch could drive market growth, Harrison said. He estimates Radius could achieve 50 percent market share at peak, with $1 billion in peak sales in the late 2020s. If the patch form of Tymlos succeeds, the analyst said the company can achieve $2 billion in peak sales, driving almost a four-fold potential return on Radius. The consensus estimates for Radius have yet to account for the potential of elacestrant, a new agent for women who have not found success with prior breast cancer treatment, Harrison said. The Price Action Radius Health shares are down over 10 percent over the past year. Shares were up 3.07 percent at the time of publication Monday at $39.93.

2018-03-31,Leerink's Takeaways From CNBC's 'Healthy Returns' Conference,"The CNBC Healthy Returns Conference recently came to an end, and Leerink analyst Ana Gupte summarized the key takeaways from the event in a note on Thursday. Here’s what investors need to know: According to venture capital and private equity investors, one of the largest investment opportunities in the health care space is gene therapy for the treatment of cancer, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s Disease. Gupte also said the health care services industry is exploding in size and scope. A panel of experts said Amazon.com, Inc.

CIGNA Corporation (NYSE:CI) CEO David Cordani discussed his vision for the future of the company. “An open architecture, collaborative network approach is preferred rather than one specific, owned care delivery model,” Gupte said. Technology can provide new means of diagnosis and treatment. For example, virtual reality therapy is being tested for acute and chronic pain management. Modern medicine and technology is on the brink of dramatically expanding the human life expectancy, driven my new early detection methods for deadly conditions. Leerink analyst Bradley Canino also initiated coverage of Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS) on Thursday with an Outperform rating and $53 price target. “Tymlos is off to a promising start, and the company is advancing a unique and proprietary transdermal patch version of the medicine,” Canino wrote.

(NASDAQ:ZIOP) Stocks In Focus Gemphire Faces Setback With Respect to Cholesterol Drug Gemphire Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:GEMP) announced the FDA has sought data from a sub-chronic toxicology study to support lifting of the partial clinical hold imposed on its gemcabene with respect to clinical trials of duration over six months. The agency also deemed the end-of-Phase 2 meeting and the subsequent initiation of Phase 3 trials investigating gemcabene in dyslipidemia indications and long-term safety exposure trials needed for registration will not take place until the partial hold is lifted. FDA's objection stems from the fact that it deems PPAR agonists or agents having PPAR-like properties to be potential liver toxins. With the timeline for lifting the six-month clinical hold pushed forward from July 31, 2018 to Sept. 30, 2019, the company amended its loan agreement with SVB for purposes of the requirement to provide cash security to SVB, or prepayment of the loan. Separately, the company also said it amended its agreement with Pfizer over gemcabene it signed in April 2011, extending the date of the agreed deadline for the first commercial sales.

2019-10-03,Biotech Stock On The Radar: FDA Comes Calling For Pfenex' Osteoporosis Biosimilar,"Pfenex Inc (NYSE:PFNX) has a key binary event coming up: mark your calendar for Oct. 7, when the FDA is scheduled to issue its verdict on the company's lead drug candidate. Through its production platform Pfenex Expression Technology, the biotech Pfenex engages in the development of high-value protein-based therapeutics and vaccines. This thinly traded micro-cap biotech has more than doubled year-to-date. Has the rally run out of steam, or is there further upside ahead? Clinical Pipeline The most advanced product candidate in Pfenex' pipeline, PF708, is inching closer to commercialization. The lead candidate is a therapeutic equivalent of Eli Lilly And Co (NYSE:LLY)'s Forteo, which was approved in 2002 to treat osteoporosis in men and menopausal women who are at high risk of fractures. Forteo's global sales stood at $1.6 billion in 2019. Following the midcycle review of Pfenex's NDA for PF708 in May, the FDA did not identify any issues requiring an Adcom meeting, the company said in its second-quarter earnings release. The company is gearing for a commercial launch in the U.S. as early as the fourth quarter of 2019, subject to FDA approval. Pfenex is also striving to get an A therapeutic equivalence designation for PF708 to Forteo, which will allow PF708 to be automatically substituted for Forteo. The company's development and licensing partner Alvogen has assumed the responsibility to manufacture and commercialize PF708 in the U.S. at its own expense. Alvogen has also been granted exclusive rights to market PF708 in the EU, certain countries in the Middle East and North Africa and the rest of the world, excluding those Asian countries for which China NT Pharma has secured the licensing rights. Pfenex is eligible to receive a gross profit split of up to 60% on product sales from Alvogen, depending on the geography and cost of goods sold. The company is eligible for double-digit royalties on net sales from NT Pharma. Alvogen has submitted a Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency. Initial comments on the application are expected in the third quarter of 2019. The Pipeline Pfenex's other wholly owned investigational compounds include: -PF582 (randibizumab), a biosimilar candidate to Lucentis marketed by Roche Holdings AG Basel ADR (OTC:RHHBY) and Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), indicated to treat retinal diseases. -PF529, a biosimilar candidate to Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)'s Neulasta for treating chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. -PF690, a biosimilar product to Oncaspar, a drug indicated to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia that's marketed by Shire, which has been acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (NYSE:TAK). -Anthrax vaccine candidates Px563L/RPA563. -Under partnered programs, Pfenex has PF743, a recombinant crisantaspase and PF745, a recombinant crisantaspase with a half-life extension technology, both produced using its PET platform under an agreement with Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC (NASDAQ:JAZZ). PF743, which has been named JZP-458, has completed a Phase 1 study successfully, with Jazz aiming to start a Phase 2/3 study later this year. -Pfenex has development and commercial partnerships for CRM-197, a non-toxic mutant of diphtheria toxin, which functions as a carrier for polysaccharides and haptens, making them immunogenic. It has commercial agreements in place with Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) and the Serum Institute of India, or SII. Merck is using CRM197 in 12 Phase 3 studies for its V114, an investigational 15-valence conjugate vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal disease. SII has a 10-valence pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Pneumosil, which utilizes CRM197. SII has initiated the process of World Health Organization prequalification for Pneumosil in the first quarter of 2019, with the process likely taking upto a year. See also: Movers And Shakers At ESMO 2019: Immunomedics, G1 Therapeutics, Seattle Genetics And More Competition Apart from the $1.6 billion in sales netted by Eli Lilly, Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS)'s Tymlos, another approved osteoporosis drug, posted sales of $100 million, taking the total sales of osteoporosis drugs to $1.7 billion last year. Pfenex may also have to brace for additional competition, as Evenity developed by Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Belgian biotech UCB has been given the nod in the U.S. for treating osteoporosis in menopausal women at a high risk of fracture, although the EU has yet to approve the drug. Osteoporosis product sales are expected to reach $6.7 billion in the U.S., Japan and the five major European markets by 2025. About 53 million Americans either have osteoporosis or are at increased risk, Pfenex said, citing NIH estimates. Financials Revenue recognized by Pfenex is through collaboration agreements, licensing agreement, government contracts and sales of reagent protein products. A majority of the company's 2018 revenues were derived from its collaboration agreement with Jazz and from its advanced development contract with BARDA, with each accounting for over 10% of its total revenues. Source: 10-Q Filing For the three months ended June 30, 2019, the company reported revenue of $2.81 million, down from $4.19 million year-over-year. The loss per share narrowed from 41 cents to 24 cents, as R&D expenses declined about 55%. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $41.62 million as of June 30. Upcoming Catalysts Oct. 3: Presentation at the Cantor Healthcare Conference. Oct. 7: PDUFA Date For PF708. Commercial launch of PF708: as early as the fourth quarter of 2019 (contingent on FDA approval). Licensee Jazz to initiate Phase 2/3 study of PF743 (JZP-458): later this year. Potential sales royalty payments for the Serum Institute of India's Pneumosal: as early as the first quarter of 2020, when the WHO prequalification process is complete. Stock Take Pfenex, which went public in July 2014 through an 8.33-million-share IPO priced at $6 per share, rose to a post-IPO high of $24.41 in a year. The stock then went downhill, troughing at $2.07 in December 2017 before attempting a modest recovery that took it to a peak of $8.42 in mid-2018. Thereafter, it has been more of a consolidation move. The stock has traded in a 52-week range of $3.13-$10.20. Source: Y Charts From an near-term intraday low of $5.65 on Aug. 5, Pfenex shares rallied to a high of $10.20 on Sept. 17, a peak-trough gain of roughly 81%. The catalyst for the recent rally has been the kickoff of a $17-million development milestone payment from Jazz for PF745. The 50-day SMA has not been violated to the downside by the stock since early August, with the measure currently at $7.448. Buying could emerge if the stock drops back to this level. The $7.20-$7.30 region served as resistance for the stock since the middle of May before buying pushed the stock past this resistance in early September. If this resistance-turned support level breaks down, the next support could be around $5.40-$5.50, a low from which the stock has bounced a few times in recent months. On the contrary, the stock could revisit its recent highs around $9.70-$10.20 on a potentially favorable reaction to the PDUFA catalyst. Pfenex's pipeline optionality and a steady stream of milestone payments from partnered programs and collaborations could cushion the stock even in the wake of an adverse outcome. In early September, JMP Securities analyst Jason Butler upgraded shares of Pfenex from Market Perform to Outperform and raised the price target from $13 to $17, suggesting over 100% upside potential.

(NASDAQ:AMGN): Overweight, $280 price target Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:VRTX): Overweight/$250 Alector Inc (NASDAQ:ALEC): Overweight/$27 Fulcrum Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:FULC): Overweight/$29 Sarepta Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SRPT): Overweight/$160 SAGE Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:SAGE): Overweight/$125 Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS): Overweight/$36 Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc (NASDAQ:RARE): Overweight/lowered the price target from $76 to $73 Bearish Ionis Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:IONS): Underweight/$48 MacroGenics Inc (NASDAQ:MGNX): Underweight/$6 Innoviva Inc (NASDAQ:INVA): Underweight/$8 The Thesis The macro themes for 2020 are likely to be use of cash by large caps, trends in innovation and drug pricing/election risk, the same as in 2019, Harrison said in a Tuesday note. Yet investors are becoming more comfortable with the potential political risks, which is likely to reduce the potential of these risks to create volatility in the sector, the analyst said. See Also: Zynerba Analyst Says Stock A Buy Ahead Of Zygel Data Release In 2020 Large-Cap Picks Among large-cap biotechs, the analyst said he is focusing on growth over value, with Amgen and Vertex being his key calls. Harrison said he sees multiple expansion and positive earnings revisions for Amgen due to a renewed growth outlook, conservative guidance and pipeline optionality. Vertex stock is headed higher in 2020, he said, propelled by a robust launch of triple combo cystic fibrosis drug Trikafta and positive Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency data. SMID-Cap Stocks Poised To Outperform In the SMID space, the analyst likes Alector due to expectations that the Phase 2 dementia data will be a key derisking event. Harrison sees Fulcrum as a key undervalued SMID with pivotal data in a rare muscle disease with $1-billion potential in the third quarter of 2020. For Sarepta, the analyst said pivotal DMD gene therapy data should derisk the bull case. Harrison is positive on Sage on the premise of a return to positive Phase 3 data for major depressive disorder and Phase 3 readouts due in 2020. Ultragenyx is underappreciated, the analyst said. Morgan Stanley expects continued expansion of Crysvita in Latin America, the launch of UX007 and advancement of the gene therapy programs to drive the stock in 2020. For Radius, Harrison forecast stock outperformance due to sustained performance of its osteoporosis drug Tymlos and increased visibility into the Phase 3 study of the abaloparatide patch."

2021-05-06,Radius Health's Earnings: A Preview,"Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS) announces its next round of earnings this Friday, May 07. Here is Benzinga's everything-that-matters guide for this Friday's Q1 earnings announcement. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Sell-side analysts are expecting Radius Health's loss per share to be near $0.41 on sales of $60.38 million. Radius Health reported a per-share loss of $0.59 when it published results during the same quarter last year. Sales in that period totaled $47.92 million. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the consensus estimates; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an earnings surprise, which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. If the company were to report earnings in line when it publishes results Friday, earnings would be up 30.51%. Sales would be up 25.99% on a year-over-year basis. The company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q4 2021 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate -0.42 -0.21 -0.74 -0.69 EPS Actual -0.23 0.15 -0.67 -0.59 Revenue Estimate 59.86 M 78.38 M 48.40 M 46.26 M Revenue Actual 62.78 M 77.83 M 50.11 M 47.92 M Stock Performance Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 42.48%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders can be content going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Radius Health is scheduled to hold the call at 08:30:00 ET and can be accessed here."

The U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy setting arm — the FOMC — met this week and the key takeaway from the meeting is that after being at a very accommodative level of 0-0.25% ever since the onset of the pandemic, the fed funds target could be hiked as early as 2023. Several stock-specific catalysts also panned out negatively. After Aduhelm approval, Biogen, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB) faced multiple clinical trial disappointments, including a failed gene therapy study in choroideremia and stalling of an Alzheimer's trial. High-flying meme stock Orphazyme A S ADR (NASDAQ:ORPH) came crashing down after the Food and Drug Administration slapped a complete response letter for its new drug application for an investigational drug to treat Niemann-Pick disease type C, a rare, progressive, neurodegenerative disease. Among the other FDA decisions due for the week, Eton Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETON) and Blueprint Medicines Corp (NASDAQ:BPMC) secured nods for treatments for low blood pressure and advanced systemic mastocytosis, respectively. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd (NYSE:TAK) is yet to hear from the FDA on its eosinophilic esophagitis treatment. German vaccine developer CureVac BV (NASDAQ:CVAC), backed by the Gates Foundation, reported disappointing Phase 2/3 results for its vaccine candidate, sending its shares down by over 40% in a single session. The week, however, started with some positive tidings from Novavax, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVAX). The Maryland-based biopharma reported encouraging data from the U.S. leg of the Phase 3 study of its vaccine candidate against the wild coronavirus and variants. The week also witnessed a host of an initial public offering, as IPO news flow resumed after a lull.

2021-09-07,Radius Health Earnings Perspective: Return On Capital Employed,"According to Benzinga Pro data, during Q2, Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS) posted sales of $51.80 million. Earnings were up 11.28%, but Radius Health still reported an overall loss of $11.89 million. Radius Health collected $56.26 million in revenue during Q1, but reported earnings showed a $13.40 million loss. Why Is ROCE Significant? Earnings data without context is not clear and can be difficult to base trading decisions on. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) helps to filter signal from noise by measuring yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q2, Radius Health posted an ROCE of 0.05%. It is important to keep in mind that ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but does not account for factors that could affect earnings and sales in the near future. ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Radius Health is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. For Radius Health, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.05% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Upcoming Earnings Estimate Radius Health reported Q2 earnings per share at $-0.22/share, which beat analyst predictions of $-0.33/share."

2021-10-20,Why Are Radius Health Shares Soaring Today?,"The Menarini Group and Radius Health Inc (NASDAQ:RDUS) have announced topline results from the EMERALD Phase 3 study evaluating elacestrant as second- or third-line monotherapy in ER+/HER2- advanced/metastatic breast cancer patients. There were two primary endpoints: progression-free survival (PFS) in the overall population and PFS in patients with tumors harboring estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations. EMERALD met both primary endpoints, showing statistically significant PFS. The safety profile of elacestrant exhibited in EMERALD was similar to that of the previous clinical trial. Menarini and Radius plan on proceeding with regulatory submissions in both the U.S. and European Union in 2022. Elacestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD).

2022-05-31,Radius Health's Return On Capital Employed Insights,"Radius Health (NASDAQ:RDUS) brought in sales totaling $43.16 million during Q1 according to data provided by Benzinga Pro. However, earnings decreased 17.27%, resulting in a loss of $18.28 million. In Q4, Radius Health brought in $65.11 million in sales but lost $15.58 million in earnings. Why Is ROCE Significant? Earnings data without context is not clear and can be difficult to base trading decisions on. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) helps to filter signal from noise by measuring yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Generally, a higher ROCE suggests successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. In Q1, Radius Health posted an ROCE of 0.07%. It is important to keep in mind that ROCE evaluates past performance and is not used as a predictive tool. It is a good measure of a company's recent performance, but does not account for factors that could affect earnings and sales in the near future. ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Radius Health is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. For Radius Health, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.07% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Upcoming Earnings Estimate Radius Health reported Q1 earnings per share at $-0.39/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $-0.21/share.

2023-09-14,"Inflation Surges, Consumer Demand Ignites Reflation Trade: Top 5 ETFs Dominating Thursday's Market","Thursday morning was marked by the release of significant economic data for the United States, setting the tone for the trading session. The producer price index rose by 0.7% month-on-month in August, jumping from July’s 0.3% increase and surpassing estimates of 0.4%. This represented the highest monthly price increase for producers since June 2022. Annual inflation among producers reached 1.6%, exceeding economists’ projections of 1.2%. The PPI’s unexpected rise comes on the heels of a higher-than-expected consumer price index report released just a day earlier. August CPI inflation increased to 3.7%, up from 3.2% in July, slightly above the anticipated 3.6%. These elevated figures have raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, as mounting inflation pressures could prompt the Fed to rethink its interest rate path. Despite the reactivation of inflationary pressures, American consumer demand remains strongly robust. August witnessed 0.6% month-on-month growth in retail sales, surpassing July’s 0.5% and beating expectations of 0.2%. This impressive streak marks the fifth consecutive month of rising retail sales. The resilience in consumer spending defies the gravitational pull of inflation and high interest rates, confounding market analysts and policymakers alike. Experts Weigh In On Reflation Phase Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said consumers continue to spend more than anticipated despite the higher interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve now faces a tough task, as data coming in hotter than predicted could put increasing pressure on the central bank to consider raising rates once more at the November meeting, he said. Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, tried to cool down the excitement, stating that retail sales figures are not adjusted for inflation. The expert highlighted that the surge in August retail sales was primarily driven by an increase in gas purchases. When accounting for inflation, the economy shows signs of losing some momentum, although many businesses still enjoyed a strong summer with growing sales.
