2018-02-12,Finding Opportunity In Steel ETFs,"Perhaps not surprisingly, the materials sector, a high beta group, got caught up in the recent equity market sell-off. Year-to-date, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), the largest materials exchange traded fund by assets, is down 3.5 percent. Although the broader materials sector struggled in recent weeks, some analysts said opportunity remains with steel stocks. CFRA Research recently issued a favorable view on steel equities, including AK Steel Holding Corp.(NASDAQ:AKS) and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF). “Automakers have successfully reduced the weight of vehicles by hundreds of pounds; much more weight reduction is required, however, to meet new fuel efficiency standards,” CFRA equity analyst Matt Miller said in a recent note. “Innovations in steel technology have generated advanced high strength steels that strike the correct balance of strength, formability, weight and cost. Despite ongoing market share gains for aluminum and other composite materials, AHSS remains the preferred material in auto manufacturing.” Holding Up Pretty Well While XLB recently tumbled, the VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX) is higher by nearly 1 percent this year. The $161.8-million SLX holds 27 stocks, including a combined 3.1-percent allocation to Cleveland-Cliffs and AK Steel. “AKS produces virtually every grade of AHSS and is pursuing innovations in steel technologies, including advances in third-generation AHSS,” said CFRA's Miller. “During 2017, AKS acquired Precision Partners, a leader in advanced product design engineered solutions and tool design and build. Precision gives AKS an end-to-end solution, pairing AKS with Precision's tool and die and stamping capabilities. As of Feb. 8, AKS traded at a forward 12-month consensus EV/EBITDA of 6.6X, 13 percent below the 7.6x average of the broader steel market.” Year-to-date, investors have added about $10 million to SLX after pulling $61.3 million from the ETF last year. Other Ideas The $850.3-million SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) is a diversified play on metals and mining equities with an almost 48-percent weight to steel stocks, by far XME's largest industry exposure. XME is down about 5.6 percent this year, but it allocates 4.4 percent of its weight to Cleveland Cliffs. “By 2020, CLF expects to be the sole producer of hot briquetted iron in the Great Lakes region from its first production plant in Toledo, Ohio,” said CFRA. “HBI is a premium form of direct reduced iron with a high iron content (more than 90 percent) and is used as a substitute for scrap by electric arc furnaces. We think the HBI facility is a strategically important project (with strong capital returns), given the rise in EAFs (vs. blast furnaces). As of Feb. 8, CLF traded at a NTM consensus EV/EBITDA of 6.2x, an 18-percent discount to steel peers.” CFRA has a marketweight rating on XME.

2019-09-09,10 ETFs That Could Be Primed For A Short Squeeze,"Traders are always on the lookout for the next short squeeze candidate. Short squeezes can send share prices skyrocketing in a matter of minutes and hours, and traders who are along for the ride can make a killing just by timing one squeeze correctly. S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky released his latest list of the top short squeeze ETFs candidates based on short interest and short percent of float. Dusaniwsky said there are currently only 11 U.S. ETFs with short interest of at least $25 million and short percent of float of at least 40%. “Borrow rates on these ETF shorts are generally cheaper than equities with high SI % Float due to the ability for brokers to create ETFs as trading or stock borrow demand increases, although ETNs and leveraged ETFs usually have higher stock borrow rates due to the difficulty and expense of creating new shares,” Dusaniwsky wrote in the report.

2020-06-03,'Fast Money' Traders Weigh In On Gold,"On CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report, Meghan Shue said that short-term fundamentals suggest a mixed outlook for gold in the near term. She would look for a better entry point. Joe Terranova said he always likes to have gold in his portfolio because it offers diversification. He added that in the current environment, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) would work better than SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Pete Najarian also likes the miners and he would consider individual names that provide exposure to gold. He currently owns SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (NYSE:XME), which has a mix of metals and gold names."
2021-02-21,Carter Worth And Mike Khouw's XME Trade,"Carter Worth of Cornerstone Macro spoke on CNBC's Options Action about SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME). He said industrial metals have traded significantly higher recently and he expects to see a catch-up trade in metal stocks. The U.S. Spot Raw Industrial Index has exceeded the peak from 2018 and the XME has not returned to its highs yet. He expects to see a breakout in XME. Mike Khouw suggested a bullish options trade in the name. He wants to sell the March $33 put for 20 cents to buy the June $37 call for $2.91. The total cost for the trade is $2.71 and it breaks even at $39.71 or 8.53% above the closing price on Friday. If the ETF drops below $33, Khouw is going to have to buy the stock at $33."
2021-07-09,Understanding SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF's Unusual Options Activity,"Shares of SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $43.58. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-07-23 Strike Price: $43.50 Volume: 1000 Open Interest: 8 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-07-13,Unusual Options Activity Insight: SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF,"SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved down to $43.06 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-07-30 Strike Price: $42.00 Volume: 1 Open Interest: 61 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock.

2021-07-22,Analyzing SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF's Unusual Options Activity,"Shares of SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) saw some unusual options activity on Thursday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $41.23. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2022-01-21 Strike Price: $33.00 Volume: 1501 Open Interest: 1563 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.

2022-05-11,"CNBC's Final Trades: Nvidia, Target, Metals & Mining And This Defensive Play","On CNBC’s “Halftime Report Final Trades,” Jon Najarian recommended SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME), adding “June 50 calls.” Jim Lebenthal of Cerity Partners named Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as his final trade. “Whether you believe my correction call or not, we’re at least due for relief rallies.

2022-06-13,Is This ETF Ready To Rally?,"There’s a chance that the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) may be about to rally. And it’s because of seller’s remorse. As you can see on the chart below, the important $48 price level was a resistance level. Each time XME reached it, the sellers put a ceiling on the price. But now the price is higher and many of these investors regret selling. A number of these remorseful sellers decide to buy their shares back, but only if they can get them for the same price at which they sold. As a result, they place buy orders at the price that was previously resistance. If there are enough of these buy orders the level converts into support. That was the case on May 12 for XME and a move higher followed. There’s a chance it happens again. To learn more about trading, check out the new Benzinga Trading School."
2022-10-24,All That Glitters: What 3 Global Mining Companies Offer High-Yield Dividends?,"The iShares MSCI Global Select Metals & Mining Producers ETF (BATS:PICK) is down roughly 16.53% year-to-date. Despite being down, it was considerably better than the S&P 500 down nearly 21% year-to-date. This ETF offers access to the global mining industry through an international basket of companies engaged in the extraction and production of metals. Meanwhile, the international mining ETF’s rival SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) invested in U.S. mining companies and is up roughly 5.7 % year-to-date. This domestic mining ETF’s top 15 holdings include copper-heavy miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX), which has suffered in its third-quarter earnings due to falling copper prices. A factor to consider when investing in mining companies is that their dividend increases can be inconsistent over the years as commodity prices are volatile, especially when faced with high demand. Go To: Benzinga's Personal Finance Hub Educating You On Choosing The Appropriate Financial Resources Rio Tinto Group plc (NYSE:RIO) is offering a dividend yield of 9.86% or $5.34 per share annually, utilizing semiannual payments, with an unpredictable track record of increasing its dividends. Rio Tinto is a global diversified miner and its dominant commodity is iron ore, with significantly lesser contributions from copper, aluminum, diamonds, gold and industrial minerals. Market conditions were good, albeit below last year's record levels. We delivered largely flat production and solid financial results, with an underlying EBITDA of $15.6 billion. As a result, we are paying our second highest-ever interim dividend of $4.3 billion, a 50% payout, in line with our policy. The market environment has become more challenging at the end of the period,” said Rio Tinto’s CEO Jakob Stausholm. Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) is offering a dividend yield of 8.30% or $1.12 per share annually, making semiannual payments, with an inconsistent track record of increasing its dividends. Vale is a large global miner and the world's largest producer of iron ore and pellets. In recent years, the company has sold assets such as its fertilizer, coal and steel operations to concentrate on iron ore, nickel and copper. On May 6, Vale disclosed it entered into a long-term contract with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to supply class one nickel in the U.S. from its operations in Canada. Vale’s target is to deliver 30% to 40% of class one nickel sales into the fast-growing electric vehicle industry. Vale announced on May 16 that it concluded the buyback program started in October 2021, with 200 million shares repurchased at an average price of $ 17.56 per share totaling $3.5 billion. Vale also announced on April 27 that it started a new buyback program, which is limited to the maximum purchase of 500 million common shares and their respective ADRs. The new program will be implemented over the next 18 months from the announcement date. BHP Group Ltd (NYSE:BHP) is offering a dividend yield of 6.62% or $3.25 per share annually, conducting semiannual payments, with an infrequent track record of increasing its dividend payments. BHP Group is a global diversified miner supplying iron ore, copper, gold, metallurgical coal, nickel and potash. BHP CEO Mike Henry commented: “BHP delivered strong operational performance and disciplined cost control to realize record underlying earnings of $40.6 billion and record free cash flow of $24.3 billion.” In the second quarter of 2023 earnings release, BHP saw its nickel production grow by 16% quarter-over-quarter and copper production by 9%.

2023-04-11,S&P 500 Holds Steady While Tech Slides As Traders Await Key Inflation Print: Fed's Williams Says Another Hike Is 'Reasonable',"The market is shifting gears ahead of Wednesday's key inflation report and in preparation for the start of the earnings season. The Nasdaq 100 index of technology stocks fell, despite crypto-related startups rallying, as Bitcoin extended gains beyond $30,000. Large-cap companies fared relatively better. Treasury yields rose slightly. Investors assigned a 70% likelihood of a Fed rate hike next month. New York Federal Reserve President John Williams, who spoke Monday after the market close, said that one more rate hike is a reasonable starting place and added there is no evidence yet of a tightening of credit conditions. Cues From Tuesday’s Trading: The S&P 500 index was flat on the day, holding at about 4,100 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked higher by 0.4%, driven by gains in the industrials and health-care sectors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index slipped 0.6%, pulled down by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), both of which fell more than 2%. U.S. Indices' Performance On Monday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite -0.4% 12,037.65 S&P 500 Index +0.08% 4,113.32 Dow Industrials +0.38% 33,722.07 Analyst Color: Despite job growth showing some softness, the unemployment rate remains at 50-year lows, providing the Federal Reserve with plenty of room to “stay higher for longer” within their stated goals, said fund manager Louis Navellier. Therefore, investors trying to time the market for a major rally from rate cuts in 2023 would probably be disappointed, he said. “A relief rally, however, when the Fed announces a pause in further cuts remains quite likely, though maybe short-lived, if unemployment does, in fact, start to rise from 3.5% to 4.5%,” he added. If results and forecasts from companies confirm that earnings contraction has bottomed in the first quarter, what the Fed does matters less, Navellier said. “Companies which retain pricing power and are addressing their cost structure will outperform indexes even if the Fed has to go even higher than expected to move closer to their objectives.” Tuesday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Monday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) edged 0.1% higher to $410.18, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.4% to $337.17 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) eased 0.6% to $316.05 according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-12,"Nasdaq, S&P 500 Price Action Reveals Anxiety As Traders Assess Inflation Data, Await Fed Minutes","The stock market is jittery after early excitement at the release of March inflation data faded throughout Wednesday's session, as investors worry the future of the Federal Reserve's monetary policies, with the minutes of the most recent FOMC meeting due Wednesday afternoon. The U.S. inflation rate slowed more than expected to 5% year-on-year in March, marking the lowest print since May 2021. Core inflation remained hot, ticking up from 5.5% in February to 5.6%, matching predictions. The Fed's Tom Barkin said inflation has peaked but the Fed still have a ways to go to get it under control. Investors presently estimate a 75% chance of another Fed interest rate rise in May, but expect this will be the final lift, with a first rate cut factored in as early as July. Cues From Wednesday's Trading: Stocks were volatile on Wednesday. Following the inflation report, major U.S. market indices soared before reversing the majority of gains in noon trade. The S&P 500 index was 0.2% higher on the day, but 0.8% lower than intraday highs. The Nasdaq 100 was flat, shedding 1.2% from intraday highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average held steady, posting a 0.3% gain and remaining not too far from daily highs. U.S. Indices' Performance On Wednesday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite +0.05% 12,038.18 S&P 500 Index +0.2% 4,117.63 Dow Industrials +0.28% 33,779.19 Analyst Color: The March CPI report showed a few signs of disinflationary forces, but not widespread deflation in the goods categories, according to Michael Gapen, U.S. economist at Bank of America Securities. BofA said March CPI reading puts the Fed on pace to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at its May meeting. Despite the March improvement, the Fed believes that inflation is still far too high. Gapen expects the Fed to deliver on its dot-plot projection by hiking rates to 5%-5.25% as long as banking sector stress stays mild. Wednesday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Wednesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) edged 0.2% higher to $410.53, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.3% to $337.93 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) held steady at $315.95 according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-13,"US Stocks Rally On Cooling Price Pressures, Softening Job Market: Investors Eye Fed Hike Cycle's Conclusion","A lower-than-expected producer inflation and higher-than-expected unemployment claims boosted risk appetite on Thursday, with all major U.S. equity indices posting sharp gains as investors increased speculations about the end of the rate hike cycle after the Fed's May meeting. Interest-rate sensitive mega caps, such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have gained more than 2% on the day. A weaker greenback, with EUR/USD hitting fresh yearly highs, also supported stock advances. Cues From Thursday's Trading: Producer price inflation (PPI) decreased by 0.5% in March, falling short of forecasts for a flat monthly reading, while weekly unemployment claims surged by 11,000 to 239,000, above expectations. The two findings signal that a cooling trend in pricing pressures and the labor market is already underway. Stocks rallied across the board as investors wagered the Federal Reserve will stop raising in June and deliver the first reduction as early as July, according to latest CME Group FedWatch tool. The S&P 500 index gained 0.7%, returning above 4,100 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average grew 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed, gaining 1.4%. Small caps in the Russell 2000 index were also higher, up 0.9%. U.S. Indices' Performance On Wednesday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite +1.5% 12,097.55 S&P 500 Index +0.71% 4,118.17 Dow Industrials +0.6% 33,808.43 Analyst Color: The bond market is saying the Fed is done raising rates, said FS Insight head of research Tom Lee. He noted the two-year Treasury yield is trading about 83 basis points lower than the midpoint of the fed funds rate. If the Fed is done with raising rates sooner, it could mean the central bank will tolerate further easing of financial conditions, Lee said. He thinks this is particularly likely if the markets worry about credit tightening as commercial real estate and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other commercial lending markets show stress. “We believe bears remain trapped and April is going to be a generally strong month (based upon “rule of first five days”),” the analyst said. He also raised the specter of April panning out to be a back-end-loaded month like March. “We would use any weakness from a post-March CPI sell-off to add to equity exposure,” Lee said. Thursday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Thursday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) edged 0.76% higher to $411.12, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.3% to $338.36 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) held steady at $317.62, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-14,US Stocks Plunge As Consumer Inflation Expectations Run Wild; Treasury Yields Climb As Fed Signals More Work Is Needed,"Friday's session is marked by rising risk aversion in the U.S. stock market, with all U.S. major indices in the red, despite some of the biggest U.S. financial institutions posting better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter. JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) shares surged 7% on the day after reporting record-high revenues in the quarter, up 25% on the year, and earnings per share of $4.10, well above the $3.41 expected.

This, combined with general sentiment improving in April, has caused investors to be concerned about the future of Federal Reserve actions, with investors now pricing in a 25-basis-point increase in May with an 80% probability. Treasury yields spiked, with the yield on the two-year note rising 14 basis points to 4.11%. Recent inflation data is encouraging, according to Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, but prices are still rising too rapidly, necessitating additional Fed effort.

2023-04-18,"S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Erase Session Gains After Hawkish Fed Remarks: Investors Now Almost Fully Discount 25bp Hike In May","Tuesday's session was off to a good start for the U.S. stock market, extending gains from Monday's closing, until hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve officials came in. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he still expects hikes and did not rule out pushing the Fed funds rate in the 5.5%-5.75% range. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that he expects another rate rise in May, followed by a rate hold in June, stating that inflation remains too high. Investors now almost fully discount a 25-basis-point hike in May, according to the CME Group Fedwatch tool, and have also priced out a rate cut expected as early as July. Major U.S. companies reporting Tuesday, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT), ProLogis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), reported better-than-expected EPS last quarter, ahead of Netflix's results due after market close. Cues From Tuesday's Trading: Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 were flat on the day, erasing early morning gains after Fed hawkish remarks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.1%, while small caps in the Russell 2000 tumbled 0.8%. U.S. Indices' Performance On Tuesday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite -0.07% 12,149.19 S&P 500 Index +0.01% 4,150.44 Dow Industrials -0.09% 33,957.18 Analyst Color: Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, delved into the likelihood of the continuation of the recent market rally. The S&P 500 is coming in hot to the first-quarter earnings season, having returned 5% over the past months, said Turnquist. This marked one of the biggest rallies into a reporting period since 2000, he added. Looking at precedents, the analyst noted that since 2000, there have been 27 other quarters when the S&P 500 rallied at least 3% four weeks before the start of earnings season. “These outlier returns historically point to continued upside momentum for the index after the kickoff of earnings season, albeit at a moderated pace,” he said. The average and median seven-week returns — marking the bulk of the earnings season, were 1.4% and 3.1%, respectively, the analyst said. He sees key upside resistance for the S&P 500 Index at 4,200. Tuesday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Tuesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was holding steady at $413.97, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) eased 0.1% to $339.35 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was unchanged at $318.88, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-21,S&P 500 Headed To Weekly Losses After Five Straight Wins As Investors Fear Higher Rates For Longer,"The stock rally that began in the middle of March appears to have stalled, with investors taking profits on the back of renewed rate concerns following upbeat economic data. The S&P US Manufacturing and Services PMIs came in above forecasts in April, indicating a resurgence of pricing pressures and pushing U.S. Treasury yields higher on Friday. The broad market S&P 500 Index traded flat in midday trading on Friday, and is set to conclude the first week in the red after five straight advances. Fed futures now almost fully discount a 25-basis-point hike in May. Investors assign a 70% likelihood for rates to stay unchanged at 5-5.25% in June. Bets for the first Fed rate cut to occur in September were further trimmed, with markets now assigning a less than 50% probability, according to the latest CME Group Fedwatch tool. Cues From Friday's Trading: Stocks traded in a tight range on Friday, as traders digested mixed earnings reports and macro data prints. Major equity indices opened lower and then attempted a rebound into noon trading. The S&P 500 Index was marginally weaker, down 0.07%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 eased 0.2% while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000 were flat on the day. U.S. Indices' Performance On Friday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq 100 -0.18% 12,984 S&P 500 Index -0.07% 4,128 Dow Industrials -0.01% 33,779 A recession now looks like a foregone conclusion, said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, citing the decline in the leading indicators index to the levels last seen in November 2020 when the economy was contending with the COVID-19 pandemic. “Historically, an economic contraction has closely followed a decline in the LEI of this magnitude,” the economist said. The head fake from last year’s two quarters of negative economic growth and the uncertainty from an aggressive Federal Reserve were likely culprits for pushing down the markets last year. The good news, however, is that Roach does not expect the markets to retest those lows despite the likelihood of a recession later this year. Friday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Friday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.05% lower at $411.7, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) weakened by 0.07% to $337.71 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 0.1% higher to $316.61, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-09-01,7 Equity ETFs Excel In Goldilocks Scenario While Market Ponders Fed Rate Hike Outcome,"It has been a data-rich week, culminating with the Bureau of Labor Statistics releasing the August jobs report on Friday. Despite non-farm payrolls surpassing expectations at 187,000 versus the projected 170,000, the report revealed an uptick in the unemployment rate, rising from 3.5% to 3.8%, and wage growth falling short of predictions. On the same day, the ISM Manufacturing PMI showed a marginal increase from 46.4 to 47.6, though it remained in contraction territory. These numbers reaffirm the ‘not too hot, not too cold’ state of the economy, consistent with the PCE price index data – the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge – meeting expectations earlier in the week. Risk assets, especially stocks, are responding positively to this new ‘Goldilocks’ scenario for the U.S. economy, with investors increasingly confident that the latest economic data may lead the Fed to conclude its rate-hike campaign. Fed futures now indicate a 93% likelihood of unchanged rates in September and 63% in November, according to the CME Group Fed Watch Tool. The S&P 500 index, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), has risen by 2.8% this week, putting it on track for its best weekly performance since the end of March 2023, the second-best of the year.

2023-09-14,"Inflation Surges, Consumer Demand Ignites Reflation Trade: Top 5 ETFs Dominating Thursday's Market","Thursday morning was marked by the release of significant economic data for the United States, setting the tone for the trading session. The producer price index rose by 0.7% month-on-month in August, jumping from July’s 0.3% increase and surpassing estimates of 0.4%. This represented the highest monthly price increase for producers since June 2022. Annual inflation among producers reached 1.6%, exceeding economists’ projections of 1.2%. The PPI’s unexpected rise comes on the heels of a higher-than-expected consumer price index report released just a day earlier. August CPI inflation increased to 3.7%, up from 3.2% in July, slightly above the anticipated 3.6%. These elevated figures have raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, as mounting inflation pressures could prompt the Fed to rethink its interest rate path. Despite the reactivation of inflationary pressures, American consumer demand remains strongly robust. August witnessed 0.6% month-on-month growth in retail sales, surpassing July’s 0.5% and beating expectations of 0.2%. This impressive streak marks the fifth consecutive month of rising retail sales. The resilience in consumer spending defies the gravitational pull of inflation and high interest rates, confounding market analysts and policymakers alike. Experts Weigh In On Reflation Phase Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said consumers continue to spend more than anticipated despite the higher interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve now faces a tough task, as data coming in hotter than predicted could put increasing pressure on the central bank to consider raising rates once more at the November meeting, he said. Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, tried to cool down the excitement, stating that retail sales figures are not adjusted for inflation. The expert highlighted that the surge in August retail sales was primarily driven by an increase in gas purchases. When accounting for inflation, the economy shows signs of losing some momentum, although many businesses still enjoyed a strong summer with growing sales.
