2009-10-26,"Two ETFs (SLX, XME) For U.S. Steel Earnings","With U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) reporting earnings tomorrow, the ETF Professor recommends watching the Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX). SLX has nearly doubled year-to-date as speculation has swirled that China will renew its voracious demand for steel. Another ETF that could be in play tomorrow as it also counts U.S. Steel among its top 10 holdings is the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). XME is up about 77% year-to-date."
2009-10-27,"ETFs For Tuesday Oct, 27, 2009","The ETF Professor has decided to start a new feature and that is a list of ETFs worth watching for the next trading day. Since the Professor is starting this list today, the list will apply to trade on TUESDAY OCTOBER 27, 2009. On the back of multiple earnings reports out of the steel sector, the Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) and the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) will be worth watching. Gold appears to be rebounding in the Asian session, so give the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) a look. A leveraged gold play worth watching may be the ProShares Ultra Gold ETF (NYSE: UGL). The inverse idea here might be the ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials ETF (NYSE: SMN). The UltraShort FTSE/Xinhua China25 Proshares (NYSE: FXP) could be the inverse answer to Baidu's (Nasdaq: BIDU) glum earnings report. With AGCO (NYSE: AGCO) slated to report and the market still digesting Goldman Sachs negative report about Monsanto (NYSE: MON), the Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO) is another ETF to watch. Two currency ETFs for you: If the Euro continues to sputter against the dollar, try the Market Vectors Double Short Euro ETF (NYSE: DRR). If the dollar resumes its slide, go with the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish (NYSE: UDN)."
2009-11-09,"ETFs To Watch On November 6, 2009 (XLI, UDN, DBA, JNK, IYM)","Here is the ETF Professor's ETF Watchlist for Monday November 9, 2009. Healthcare ETFs should be in play after the House passed its version of the healthcare reform bill. The iShares Dow Jones U.S. Healthcare Providers ETF (NYSE: IHF) and the Pharmaceutical HOLDRs (NYSE: PPH) should be worth watching as should one of the Proessor's favorites, Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV). Let's make our fixed income plays the UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury ProShares (NYSE: TBT) and the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond (NYSE: JNK). The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI) gained over 5% last week, so let's see if the ETF's bullish ways can continue. On the other end of the spectrum, the PowerShares DB Agriculture ETF (NYSE: DBA) had an ugly week last week, so let's see if it can rebound. Materials names were strong last week. Let's play that trend with the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) and the iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials (NYSE: IYM).

For an international materials play, try the WisdomTree International Basic Materials ETF (NYSE: DBN). BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE: RTP) are among DBN's top holdings. The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) was up more than 4% on Monday, making it worth a look on Tuesday.

2009-12-31,Bud Fox's Opinion On 2010,"As we head into 2010, there seems to be a substantial amount of divergent market opinion. Some observers believe the indexes are headed off another cliff that will take us lower than those dark days in March. Others exclaim that we are in another bull market and it is time to buy, buy, buy. So, on the eve of a new decade, I am going to jump into the fray and offer my own opinion on where the markets are headed. The rally that we have seen in 2009 has been nothing short of extraordinary. The S&P 500 is up nearly 25% on the year, and the Nasdaq market has appreciated a whopping 45%. The tape is incredibly bullish, and for this reason I am in a bull state of mind for the beginning of 2009. In particular I would be a buyer of tech and commodity ETFs going into January, which is usually a very good month for the stock market. ETFs such as PowerShares QQQ Trust (NASDAQ: QQQQ), Semiconductor HOLDRS (NYSE: SMH), SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (NYSE: XME), United States Oil Fund (NYSE: USO), SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) are all crowded trades, but they have been working and I think they will continue to work into 2010. I am under no illusions, however, about the longer term prospects of the markets. The response to 2008's financial crisis has been nothing short of a disaster, and there will likely be dire consequences down the road. How do you borrow and spend your way out of a recession that was the direct result of too much borrowing and spending? The answer is, that you don't. What the Federal Reserve has done is merely pumped insane amounts of cheap money into the system in an effort to reflate the asset bubbles that caused the crisis in the first place. The Fed is a Ponzi scheme that makes Bernie Madoff look like a quaint neighborhood swindler. This rally is, in my opinion, an artificially created aberration that is not an accurate reflection of the state of the U.S. economy. If you did not make money by getting really long the market earlier this year, you missed it. The easy money has been made. You can chase it into 2010, but if we start to see some sustained weakness in momentum, I would run, not walk, to the sidelines. The government's fiscal policy will result in inflation and exploding interest rates at some point. A painful period of stagflation does not seem out of the question. The only asset class that is likely to outperform in this type of scenario, in my opinion, is commodities. Fast Money's Steve Cortez has described this trade as one of the most crowded he has ever seen and is bearish on the sector. I believe that the commodities trade is crowded for a simple reason - because it is working and it will continue to work in 2010 as the specter of inflation rears its ugly head. If you look at the charts of ETFs such as XME, USO, (NYSE: DBC) and (NYSE: DBA), we are way off the highs that we saw in the summer of 2008. There is plenty of room in these names to go higher. We have seen a spike in the dollar index this month, but this is likely a dead cat bounce and sooner or later the chart will head back to its long term downward trend. If this happens, commodities will continue on their bull run. An interesting way to trade if the scenario that I have laid out comes to fruition is to buy into the current momentum in the equities market and also to buy call options on the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX). It seems to me that volatility is under priced right now and we will see a spike in 2010. On the last day of the year, the VIX is 3.66% higher at 20.69. This would suggest that the pros are buying protection for their portfolios and also speculating on a spike in volatility heading into 2010. You should do the same. Don't fight the tape at the beginning of the year, but be careful, remain flexible, and prepare your portfolio for inflation, rising rates, and a falling dollar."

2010-03-20,ETF Investors Should Continue To Be Content With The Metals And Mining Industry Group,"“The metals and mining industry group has been a market leader during the past year, with the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining exchange-traded fund soaring more than 117% during the prior 52 weeks. Comparatively, the S&P 500 index has rallied some 48% during the same time frame. What’s more, XME has maintained its momentum into 2010, advancing more than 9% since the start of the year,” Joseph Hargett Reports From Forbes. Hargett goes on to say, “From a technical perspective, SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (XME) is currently consolidating into support at the 55 level as it waits for support at its rising 10-week and 20-week moving averages to catch up. From a longer-term perspective, the ETF also has support at its 10-month moving average trailing just behind the shares. This trendline provided a key floor for the fund following the market’s broad pullback in early February.” “Despite its impressive performance, investors remain extremely bearish on the metals and mining sector. For instance, XME’s Schaeffer’s put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 2.47 indicates that puts more than double calls among options with less than three months until expiration. This ratio also ranks above 87% of all such readings taken during the past year. What’s more, less than half of the 290 ratings on metals and mining stocks are “buys” or better. As XME continues its run higher, these bears could be forced to abandon their losing positions, thus resulting in additional fuel for the rally,” Hargett Reports. See More Details On The Story: HERE Here are some more details on the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME) including the holdings within the ETF below: The investment (XME) seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before expenses, the performance of an index derived from the metals and mining segment of a U.S. total market composite index.

2010-05-10,How I'm Buying Into the Market Correction,"A wise man once said be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful and this can't be more true in the world of derivatives. When fear or Volatility increases in the market, option premiums soar and easy money can be made. In this post I will explain how I am taking advantage of the increased levels of fear in the market to make some money. First, I'll give a quick fact... The S&P 500 is down about 9% from the high on April 26, and the Volatility Index (VIX) has soared almost 240% in that same period. As I stated money can easily be made selling option premium, but it can also be lost just as easy. However I'm a bit more conservative and I choose to sell put options 5% - 10% lower on stocks or market ETF's I'm willing to take shares of. This is the reason I hold a ton of cash on the sidelines at all times so I can take the shares if I am wrong without going into margin. I began selling put options on stocks and ETF's I am willing to take shares of on Friday, after realizing the SPY bounced off of the 200 day moving average. I mainly sold put options on companies which have been beaten up after good earnings, but also sold put options on a few of my favorite companies. I have put (no pun intended) together a short list of stocks below which I have sold puts on, or will be selling puts on in the week ahead for the May options expiration. The data below is as of market close Friday May 7, 2010. Company/ETF Ticker Strike Premium Adjusted Price SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) 99 $150 97.50 SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) 106 $190 104.10 PowerShares QQQ Trust, ETF (QQQQ) 43 $73 42.27 United States Oil Fund LP ETF (USO) 35 $76 34.24 SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME) 49 $135 47.65 Apple Inc.

(QCOM) 33 $25 32.75 Visa Inc. (V) 75 $55 74.45 The ideas outlined above are bullish strategies and should not be considered if you think the stock will sell off in the near future. However if you feel the stock could move higher or slightly lower in the near future, this strategy could yield a nice gain. Selling puts naked is a very risky strategy and should not be considered with stocks one does not plan or want to hold long in their portfolio. To get a better understanding of stock options and different option strategies please check out my Simplified Stock Option Trading E-Books. These are just examples and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security; if you're more bullish/bearish, you’ll want to adjust the strike price and expiration accordingly. The reason option volumes have surged in the last five years is because they are a great way to hedge your portfolio as well as create income off of your shares (see chart here). Keep in mind when using this strategy it is essential that broker commissions are low enough to profit from the position.

2010-05-20,Why Investor's Should Make Friends with Fear,"In this post I will give some advice on why I believe investor's should become friends with fear, and explain how it can be done using stock options. I'm certain many of you already know how the markets gauge fear, but for those of you who don't, a simple way to see how fearful the markets are is an indicator called the Volatility Index [VIX]. The entry symbol to track the VIX is different in almost every brokerage I use, so a sure and easy way to track it is the Ipath S&P 500 VIX Short Term ETN (VXX). Historically anything above 30 on the Volatility Index is high and signals increased levels of fear in the markets, but for those tracking market volatility using the VXX it looks to be the 24-25 level. So why should investor's make friends with fear? First it is very important to note that fear is friendly only to an investor which is well educated in stock options. Why? A major factor in pricing an option premium (or contract price) is volatility. Keeping all other things constant, higher volatility = higher premium. This means investor's can sell premiums to cost average down a position, or what I like doing in times of market correction... Selling naked puts to get into shares I don't mind owning. With the VIX soaring to new 52 week highs in the past week, I have been selling premiums on out of the money options on stocks which I wouldn't mind owning. I do have to note that in my last post How I'm Buying Into the Market Correction I closed almost all of the positions the following trading day which was Monday May 10, 2010, even after stating I had sold the puts as an investment and not a trade, but a move of 400+ on the Dow signaled TAKE PROFITS and easy ones were taken. With just 2 trading days left until May options expire there is still some juice left in many stocks which I wouldn't mind owning if they were put to me Friday. Below is a list of stocks I am looking at selling puts on, the strike prices, and the per contract premium I would receive as of close Wednesday May 19, 2010. Company/ETF Ticker Strike Premium Adjusted Price SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA) 100 $20 $99.80 SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) 107 $24 $106.76 PowerShares QQQ Trust, ETF (QQQQ) 44 $8 $43.92 United States Oil Fund LP ETF (USO) 33 $33 $32.67 Financial SPDR ETF (XLF) 14 $4 $13.96 Technology SPDR ETF (XLK) 21 $5 $20.95 SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME) 48 $30 $47.70 Apple Inc.

(V) 70 $72 $69.28 *Indicates June options expiration.Before selling any puts naked, I always make sure I have enough cash to purchase the shares. I won't be in any rush to sell premiums Thursday because as of 2 AM (EST) futures are slightly under pressure, but once I get the feel of the market I will begin selling premiums on many of the stocks/ETFs outlined in the table above. It is also possible (and likely with the high volatility) that I will be adjusting strike prices according to the market.The ideas outlined above are bullish strategies and should not be considered if you think the stock will sell off in the near future. However if you feel the stock could move higher or slightly lower in the near future, this strategy could yield a nice gain. Selling puts naked is a very risky strategy and should not be considered with stocks one does not plan or want to hold long in their portfolio. To get a better understanding of stock options and different option strategies please check out my Simplified Stock Option Trading E-Books. These are just examples and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security; if you're more bullish/bearish, you’ll want to adjust the strike price and expiration accordingly. The reason option volumes have surged in the last five years is because they are a great way to hedge your portfolio as well as create income off of your shares (see chart here). Keep in mind when using this strategy it is essential that broker commissions are low enough to profit from the position.In conclusion I wanted to briefly explain to investor's that something good can be made of fear. Remember fear or volatility brings increased option premiums, therefore if shares fall and are put to an investor on May options expiration, volatility will likely increase or stay the same and option premiums will still be high for June options expiration. Therefore June call options can be written against the shares to sell them at a specific price for an increased option premium as well... But that's an article for another day.Disclosure: Long BAC, C, F, QCOM, V, GOOG January 300 Calls, Short SIRI June 1 Puts"
2010-05-24,Solid Pullback  05-24-2010,"Cusick’s Corner Late day sellers jumped in when it became clear that Financials, Commodities and the Euro were in a solid pullback. With the market unable to break the upside going into the afternoon, the oversold market continues to be oversold. Traders have been flocking to the bid in the Bond markets in anticipation of a potentially disinflationary market (materializing much like what occurred in Japan). Bottom line, do not try to outthink the trade, stay focused and keep your powder dry. See you Midday. The Financials led the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a 126-point loss Monday. Morning action was relatively quiet and the major averages were mixed into midday. There was little news to guide the early action, but the major averages did seem to find some support from a report on existing homes sales, which showed an increase to 577 million homes (annualized) in April (vs. 536 mln consensus). However, the underlying tone remained cautious and then volatility clearly picked up in the final hour. At the end of the day, JP Morgan (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) were the biggest losers in the Dow and the industrial average finished 129 points from its best levels of the day. The tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 15.5 and down 31 points from session highs. Bullish Flow Options action picked up in Biogen Idec (BIIB). Shares of the biotech gave up 71 cents to $48.27 and 6,280 calls traded in the name, which is 3X normal and about 10X the number of puts. June 55 calls were the most actives. 2760 changed hands and 73 percent traded at the asking price. Another 1239 June 50s traded, 82 percent on the ask. Shares are down about 19.5 percent over the past two months and Monday’s call buying is noteworthy, as it comes ahead of Biogen’s presentation at an important ASCO conference in early June. Implied volatility rose 2.5 percent to 41 American Axle (AXL), Asmel (ASML), and Cardtronics (CATM) also had bullish order flow. Bearish Flow Bermudian Property and Casualty Insurance company XL Capital (XL) lost 37 cents to $17 and has now fallen 12.9 percent since May 12. Options action seems to be turning somewhat bearish as well. Monday, about 20,000 puts and 735 calls traded on the company. June 15 puts saw the most volume. 12,860 changed hands, including a block of 5000 at the 35-cent asking price. June 17 and January 14 puts saw interest as well. Implied volatility rose about 3.5 percent to a multi-month high of 60, as some players in the options market seem to be buying puts and bracing for additional losses in XL. Bearish flow also picked up in Covanta Holding (CVA), Lincare (LNCR), and Mead Johnson Nutrition (MJN). Index Trading CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) strayed from its normal pattern. The volatility index fell 1.78 points to 38.3 despite a 14-point loss in the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) Monday. Since VIX tracks the expected volatility priced into SPX options, it normally rises when SPX makes a volatile move lower. However, early Monday, VIX came under pressure after big gains the week before. The index rallied nearly 15 points Tuesday through Thursday. Monday, VIX hit a morning low of 35.57 after last week’s big move, but then rallied in afternoon trading and finished 7.7 percent above its lows of the day. Meanwhile, trading volume was on the light side. With 109,000 calls and 95,000 puts traded on the VIX. 553,000 calls and 646,000 puts traded across all the index products. ETF Trading SPDR Metals and Mining ETF (XME) finished down 75 cents to $47.97 and options volume hit 2X the average daily, led by June 47 – September 50 put diagonal spread, which was sold at $4.10, 10000X on the AMEX. It looks like a position adjustment. That is, the investor sold-to-close a position in 10,000 September 50 puts at $6.00. It was probably a position opened on April 15 when 20,000 were bought at $2.30. Shares are down 19.2 percent since that time. Another 10,000 were sold on May 12, at $3.35. So, this strategist has now exited the 20,000 puts at an average profit of $2.375 per contract, 10000X, or $2.375 million. However, they appear to be looking for additional weakness in the fund and now opening a new position in the June 47 puts."
2010-05-25,"Metals Signaling Reversal? (XME, X, FCX, AA)","Traders and investors often say that economically-sensitive materials and mining stocks will lead any rally or downturn in the stock market. Well, today many materials and miners are in the green despite the major averages being solidly in the red. The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) is up $1.40, or 2.92%, to $49.37 on the day. U.S. Steel is up $1.89, or 4.14%, to $47.53. Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) is up $2.05, or 3.13%, to $67.61. Alcoa (NYSE: AA) is up 21 cents, or 1.85%, to $11.30. Many of these stocks have been beaten down over the last month. Therefore, it is hard to tell if investors are just bargain hunting, shorts are closing out positions, or that a key reversal is taking place. Either way, it pays to watch the action in the metals space because they will signal when the correction is over."
2010-05-26,"ETFs To Watch May 26, 2010 (EWY, TBT, FXE, INDY)","Here is the ETF Professor's ETF Watch List For Wednesday May 27, 2010. The iShares MSCI South Korea Index (NYSE: EWY) continues to be struck by political risk. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) got a decent bounce on Tuesday. The Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX) continues to look weak, losing more than 3% on Tuesday. Make the ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury ETF (NYSE: TBT) your fixed income play on Wednesday. Materials names rebounded a bit on Tuesday, so keep an eye on the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) and the Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX). The iShares S&P India Nifty 50 Index (Nasdaq: INDY) was one of the few emerging markets ETFs that traded higher on Tuesday. The CurrencyShares Euro Trust (NYSE: FXE) remains in play. Chinese stocks have yet to find a bottom, so keep an eye on the ProShares UltraShort FTSE/Xinhua China ETF (NYSE: FXP)."
2010-06-02,Market is Challenging the Downtrend  06-02-2010,"Cusick’s Corner The market is challenging the downtrend, but it has been on light volume. Watch the resistance level of 1087 on the ESM10 – can be broken and challenge a downtrend line that has not been broken in the last 5 trading sessions. If there can be a late day breakout through this trendline, we could possibly see a stronger upside short-term push. An interesting trade surfaced in the Emerging Markets ETF, EEM, a strategist seems to have purchased the July 35 puts and sold the December 37 puts for a credit of $2.67 25,000 times. This is commonly called a diagonal spread, where the strategist would profit on the overall position if the stock is above $35, plus in the short-term could profit if the stock took a violent, very short-term drop. This is an option strategy that could take advantage of a potentially violent pull back in the short-term while also generating income if the market makes a longer-term move to the upside. One other note, if you sell puts you are making a statement that you want to own the stock. See you After Hours. Stocks opened modestly higher and the early advance gathered momentum with help from better than expected pending home sales data. After a 113-point decline Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened steady despite another round of losses in overseas markets. JP Morgan (JPM), which was upgraded to Buy at UBS, helped lift the Dow in early action. Then, at 10:00 ET, the industrial average popped to session highs after data showed Pending Home sales up 6 percent in April, which was better than the 4.3 percent increase that economists were expecting. March numbers were revised up to 7.1 percent from 5.3 percent. With little other news to guide the market action, the Dow has been able to hold on to most of the gains and is up 107 points midday. The NASDAQ is up more than 30. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) is down 3.85 to 31.69 and near session lows. Bullish MEMC (WFR), the St. Peters, MO silicon wafer manufacturer, is up 50 cents to $11.08 and calls are seeing very brisk trading on renewed takeover speculation. It’s unsubstantiated, but short-term speculators appear to be reacting to the chatter. June 12 calls are the day’s most actives. 8,792 contracts traded so far. June 9, 10 and 13 calls are busy as well. Commercial Metals (CMC) shares jumped $1.11 to $15.97 and options are very actively traded Wednesday. Most of the volume is in the June calls. The 17.5s, which already have 15.5K in open interest, are the most actives. 2,696 traded through midday. Another 1,296 June 16s changed hands, vs. 3,120 in open interest. While some of the activity might be offsetting, the relative strength in the stock and the increasing options action is noteworthy, as there’s no obvious company specific news to explain the action. Bearish Altria (MO) is up 17 cents to $20.29 and noteworthy activity is being seen in the June puts. Specifically, a block of 4,500 June 20 puts traded at the 42-cent Ask price. Meanwhile, a block of 4,500 June 18 puts traded on the 5-cent bid. The action has the hallmarks of a bearish June 20 – 18 bear put spread at a 37-cent net debit. It’s a short-term play with a maximum profit of $1.63 (excluding commissions) if MO falls to $18 or less by the June expiration (16 days.) Transocean (RIG) is down another $2.07 to $47.97 and options action remains brisk amid worries about the impact from the out-of-control oil spill caused by Transocean’s Deepwater Horizon rig. Shares are now off 43.5 percent since April 28 and options trading on the oil driller remains very active with another 64,000 calls and 56,000 puts traded through midday Wednesday. Unusual Volume Movers SPDR Metals and Mining ETF (XME) options volume is running 3.5X the usual, with 63,000 contracts traded and put volume accounting for about 97 percent of the activity. Genworth Financial (GNW) options activity is running 5X the usual, with 62,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 97 percent of the volume. ArvinMeritor (ARM) options volume is running 7X the usual, with 27,000 traded and put volume representing 59 percent of the activity. Canadian Solar (CSIQ), Dish Networks (DISH), and Shanda Interactive (SNDA) also have unusual volume. Implied Volatility Movers Amgen (AMGN) implied volatility is easing as shares rally on news the FDA has approved the biotechnology company’s osteoporosis treatment, Prolia. Shares are up $4.45 to $55.20 and options volume is 3.5X the recent average daily. More than 28K calls and 19K puts traded so far. Implied volatility is down about 16 percent to 31.5."

I will continue to hold the majority of my long positions (as this entire market moves as a whole these days) until I see the risk trade come off the table. Copper trading above $3.10 and holding is a signal that the risk trade is coming back for the time being. I'd like to see copper futures settle above $3.22 and then $3.40. I've moved my stops to $3.08 now and this position has been working very well for me! For a less risky investor or someone who cannot trade futures check out Freeport-Mcmoran (FCX), Cliffs Natural Resources (CLF), and the most diversified way to play the Metals & Mining SPDR (XME).I have purchased December 50 strike call options and will look to turn the position into a vertical call spread. I will decide to write upper calls against my lower calls as I'll be watching the ETF near close everyday and monitor the price action. It is also worth noting I may look to write nearer term strikes out on strength; such as the August 56 or September 58, etc... on strength in the XME.

2010-08-02,Dahlman Rose Out With An Update On Metals & Mining (XME),"Dahlman Rose & Co. is out with an industry research report on the Metals & Mining (NYSE: XME) sector this morning. In the report, Dahlman Rose writes, China's PMI for July declined to 51.2 from 52.1 in the prior month. The figure was slightly below the consensus forecast of 51.4 and is the lowest level since February 2009. While the PMI indicates that growth in China may continue to slow over the near-term, it may also signal that government tightening has run its course. Markets are reacting positively to the news, with the Shanghai Exchange up 1.7% overnight and the S&P futures are up over 1%. Chinese rebar and hot rolled coil prices continue to move higher, with rebar prices increasing by $15 per metric ton to $601 and hot rolled coil prices increasing by $6 per metric ton to $628. The move higher in steel prices has not been accompanied by a similar move higher in iron ore prices. This expansion in margins will likely provide an incentive for Chinese steel producers to increase production in the 4Q10 when quarterly iron ore price contracts reset. Which will likely stimulate higher amounts of iron ore on the seaborne market. Shares of the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF are up $1.40 to $51.29."
2010-08-19,Hyman Roth ETFs For Steel M&A Rumors,"These are go-go days for the materials sector. OK, it's not the first half of 2008, but the M&A drama is reaching blissful heights. BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) got the ball rolling with what has now become hostile bid for Postash (NYSE: POT) and now investors and traders that love the materials sector have a new rumor to track. On Wednesday, there was plenty of chatter that ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) may offer up to $80 a share for U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), the largest U.S. steel producer. The reality is Mittal, much like the Corleone family in the words of Hyman Roth, is bigger than U.S. Steel, but regardles of movie trivia, there are several ETFs that are worth looking at if this rumor persists. 1) Market Vectors Steel ETF (NSYE: SLX): Yes, SLX is an obvious choice, but U.S. Steel and Mittal are both found among the ETF's top 10 holdings and that isn't an easy combination to find among materials ETFs. SLX is the big kahuna of pure play steel ETFs. 2) PowerShares Global Steel Portfolio (Nasdaq: PSTL): Late last year, the Professor profiled PSTL as the other steel ETF and it really does not get the attention that SLX does, but PSTL also has exposure to Mittal and U.S. Steel. 3) iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials ETF (NYSE: IYM): This one is more of a derivative play on the rumor because IYM offers only slight exposure to U.S. Steel, but it could be be worth a look anyway. 4) SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME): U.S. Steel is the number eight holding in this ETF and with exposure to other big steel names, XME will be in play. 5) iShares S&P Global Materials ETF (NYSE: MXI): One day, someone will realize what a good ETF MXI is. That day should be now because investors can play both Mittal and BHP Billiton with this fund. Beat the market consistently by receiving real-time trade alerts from the ETF Professor!"
2010-08-20,Dahlman Rose Has Notes On The Metals & Mining Sector (XME),"Dahlman Rose & Co. has some thoughts on the metals & mining sector as weaker than expected economic numbers have hit the base metals hard recently. In a research note, Dahlman Rose & Co. writes, The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.7% as investors anticipate that inflationary pressure may delay monetary easing in China. Additionally, the China Ministry of Land and Resources announced that it will crack down on land hoarding as part of its efforts to keep housing prices from spiraling higher. Dahlman Rose goes on to say, Copper prices continue to correct after disappointing news was released from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, yesterday. While economic activity proves to be uneven in the US, we note the greater importance of emerging markets on demand for raw materials, with China consuming 4.2x as much copper as the US year to date. With economic activity in emerging markets remaining reasonably well supported, we anticipate continued strength in raw material prices over the medium-term. Shares of the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME), which most closely tracks Dahlman Rose's commentary, are down $1.04 to $49.29."

In the report, Dahlman discusses how the Australian election results appear to be favorable for the mining sector, as the mining tax appears less likely to be made into law. It also gives some notes on the iron ore/steel sector, saying, We anticipate that steel mill utilization may continue to trend lower over the next two weeks, as the Labor Day holiday impacts production, but we would expect a recovery in utilization as we head into the fall. Shares of the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) are rebounding sharply this morning, gaining $1.28 to trade at $48.77."
2010-09-17,"Benzinga's Top ETF Decliners (UCO, EWP, FXP, XME)","ProShares Ultra DJ-UBS Crude Oil (NYSE: UCO) dropped 2.14% on Friday, as crude oil struggled again.

The Bank of Spain reported that overall debt increased 10% in the second quarter. ProShares UltraShort FTSE/Xinhua China 25 (NYSE: FXP) lost 1.63%, as China Mobile Ltd.

2010-10-06,"We Could See A Commodities Super-Spike (GLD, SLV, USO, DBA, XLE, DBC, XME, MOO, OIH)","There is a major bull run going on in the commodity space, and investors and traders looking to play the momentum can still get in. There are a number of catalysts that could propel the entire commodity space higher over the next several months, primarily a lower dollar and more quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve. Strong trends are already in place in gold, silver, copper, agricultural commodities, and a trend may be getting underway in crude oil. Commodities are always risky because their prices are very sensitive to changes in the global economic outlook. You can make a lot, or lose a lot, of money in a hurry trading commodities. By using ETFs, as opposed to futures, however, you can limit some of that volatility as futures normally entail significant leverage. Here is what is particularly attractive about this trade right now versus a more normal market environment - you may be able to make money even if the economic outlook continues to deteriorate! This is because there is an 800lb gorilla in the marketplace right now in the form of the Federal Reserve. In the best case scenario here is how this trade will work - 1) The economy gets better and the forward looking outlook for global growth improves. Under this scenario, you will make money if you buy a diversified basket of commodity stocks and ETFs at current prices. 2) The economy continues to deteriorate which leads to more quantitative easing and currency debasement across the world. If this occurs, there is a very strong likelihood that the commodity run will continue as investors pour money into hard assets to protect themselves from monetary debasement. 3) The third scenario is likely the best - the outlook for the economy improves, but the Federal Reserve and other Central Banks engage in more QE in order to ensure the sustainability of the recovery. Under all of these scenarios, commodities should benefit. This sounds almost too good to be true, right? Well, it looks like a very nice risk/reward trade, but many commodities have already made big runs. A situation where the commodities markets fail to push higher when QE 2 is announced seems possible (as everyone is already expecting it). This is particularly true if we get some dire economic reports in the weeks surrounding QE II. There are a number of other potential developments which could spell trouble for commodities. Primarily, if the market loses faith in the efficacy of QE it would be a problem for economically sensitive commodities. If the deflation is going to happen no matter what mindset becomes entrenched, it would be a big problem. Furthermore, any strength in the U.S. Dollar would also cause a likely pull back in many commodities. The Dollar is trading near the low end of its multi-year range and a snapback rally seems at least possible right now. If you are interested in gaining exposure to commodities using ETFs and stocks, consider taking a look at the securities listed below. SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSE: SLV) United States Oil Fund ETF (NYSE: USO) PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund (NYSE: DBA) Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund ETF (NYSE: DBC) SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO) Oil Service HOLDRs ETF (NYSE: OIH)"
2010-10-06,Playing QE II: SPDR S&P Metals And Mining ETF (XME),"For traders and investors looking to play the hard asset trade ahead of what is expected to be another round of quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve, here is a fairly straightforward pick - buy the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). The near-term chart pattern looks solid, and the ETF's risk profile is substantially less than buying an individual stock such as Freeport-McMoran (NYSE: FCX) or Alcoa (NYSE: AA). During today's trading session, the XME has gained 0.95% to $55.07. On the three-month chart, the ETF has surged 23%. It has a beta of 1.6 and a market capitalization of $732.43 million. Around 2.88 million shares trade each day, on average. The ETF's 5 largest holdings are Stillwater Mining Company (NYSE: SWC), Arch Coal (NYSE: ACI), Coeur D' Alene Mines (NYSE: CDE), Hecla Mining (NYSE: HL), and Alcoa (NYSE: AA)."

2010-10-19,"Wide Variety Of ETF's Falling Today (QQQQ, XLF, XME)","A broad variety of ETF's are falling today, as the broader markets are really starting to get hit now, with the Dow Jones down over 200 points. No sector is safe, as everything from financials, commodities and technology are down sharply. PowerShares Exchange-Traded Fund ETF (NASDAQ: QQQQ) is down 46 cents to $50.84, a loss of nearly 1%. This ETF covers a majority of technology stocks, including Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG). The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) is down extremely sharply, losing more than 5.4% to $54.60. This ETF comprises companies like Alpha Natural Resources (NYSE: ANR) and Freeport McMoran Copper & Gold (NYSE: FCX). The financial sector was stronger earlier today, but has since given back all of its gains, and is now in negative territory. Select Sector SPDR Trust (NYSE: XLF) is down 12 cents to $14.54, a loss of 0.9%, after having traded as high as $14.77 on the day."
2010-10-25,Is Charlie Brown Running the G20?  10-25-2010,"Cusick's Corner I was wondering if Charlie Brown was running the G20 because all I heard out of the meeting was “Wah wha wha>> Hahaha>> Whawhawha”. Timothy Geithner tried to ask the rest of the world economies not to pull their best “Lucy van Pelt” and to pull the proverbial football away from the from the US, asking not deviate from current monetary policy, even though the US is about to infuse up to ½ trillion into our system, “Argh!” For Peanuts fans we all know that Lucy always pulls the ball away, in spite of having a signed agreement not too. At this stage risk on is the trade and as we challenge the 1200 mark on the S&Ps, the shorts continue to get squeezed and the market is comfortable with staying overbought. Watch this latest shake out, S&Ps at 1186, hold and we get a bounce into the After Hours. Major averages are higher midday Monday with help from better-than-expected housing data. With no earnings of significance and no economic data to guide the early action, stocks opened broadly higher after global finance ministers met over the weekend and agreed in theory to balance global trade. However, since no clear plans were announced, the dollar weakened and the move in the buck seemed to help boost commodities and stocks early Monday. Then, thirty minutes into trading, data showed existing homes sales at an annual rate of 4.53 million in September, up from 4.12 million in August and ahead of economist estimates of 4.25 million. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved to session highs on the data, but has come off its best levels. The Dow is up 47 points and down 68 points from the day's highs. The NASDAQ added 13.2. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) gained .91 to 19.69. Trading in the options market is active, with 3.5 million calls and 3.0 million puts traded by 12:15 ET. Bullish Ciena (CIEN) is seeing brisk trading. Shares of the networking company are up 32 cents to $14.12 and today's options volume includes 19,000 calls options, which is 8X the expected for midday and more than 6X the day's put volume. November 15 calls are the most actives. 8,630 traded so far. November 14, November 16, Jan12 15 and Jan12 17.5 calls are seeing interest as well. The strength in the stock and heavy trading in the Ciena calls is being attributed to unsubstantiated takeover speculation. A noteworthy trade surfaced in Monsanto (MON) Monday morning. Shares are up $2.38 to $59.53 after the company updated results from its Genuity Roundup Ready 2 product, which showed improvement in soybean production. Shares jumped on the news and a block of 9,500 Jan12 (January 2012) $80 calls traded at $2.97 on ISE. The trade was an opening customer buyer, according to ISEE data, and appears to be a very bullish play. The investor is paying more than $2.8 million in premium for a contract that is more than $21 out-of-the-money. Bearish Savient Pharmaceuticals (SVNT) is getting slammed. Shares are off $9.10 to $12.60 after the company said a review of strategic alternative failed to result in a sale of the company. Investors seemed to express disappointment in the news. Not only is the stock under pressure, but also 25,000 puts traded in the name. Some of the trades happened before the news. For example, one block of 2,000 November 19 puts traded at $1.20 this morning. It is now bid at $6.30. Marvell Technology (MRVL) puts are actively traded. Shares are off 15 cents to $17.55 and 14,000 contracts traded. The volume represents 5X typical volume for midday and compares to 2,140 calls. The action is scattered across November and January puts with strike prices ranging from 15 to 19. In addition, 74 percent of the put volume traded at the ask, according to data from web site Whatstrading.com. Implied volatility is up about 18 percent to 39 and the action is noteworthy, as there has been no news on the ticker to explain the bearish trading in MRVL so far today. Unusual Volume Movers SPDR Metals and Mining ETF (XME) options volume is running 2X the usual, with 22,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 63 percent of the activity, according to data from website WhatsTrading.com. SOHU options activity is running 6X the usual, with 16,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 63 percent of the volume. Royal Caribbean (RCL) options volume is 4X the typical levels, with 14,000 contracts traded and put volume accounting for 76 percent of the activity. Increasing volume is also being seen in Expedia (EXPE), Assured Guaranty (AGO), and XL Capital (XL) Implied Volatility Movers Assured Guaranty (AGO) implied volatility is up after S&P cut its credit rating on the bond insurer to AA-plus from AAA. Shares are off $2.33 to $18.95 and options volume includes 16,000 calls and 7,830 puts, or 5.5X the typical volume for AGO. Meanwhile, implied volatility surged about 24 percent to 71."

2010-11-25,5 Funds to Simplify Your Portfolio - Investment Ideas,"For many investors a top-down approach to stock selection makes perfect sense. First thinking about the economy in a macro sense to identify the sectors likely to outperform the market, then paring that into more specific industries and eventually narrowing that group down to a few select companies. However, one of the most painstaking tasks that investors face on a daily basis is selecting individual companies that would make good stocks. The main reason this is the most difficult is that the vast majority of volatility comes from uncertainty in the individual company, not over all market risk. Lower Your Risk, Save Some Time If greater than 75% of a stock's volatility is from individual stock selection, why not avoid that all together? By using sector or industry specific Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) or mutual funds an investor can isolate areas of the economy that they feel will outperform the market and put money in those companies. The added benefit is the diversification amongst many companies through a single transaction. Now that we can easily avoid sifting through thousands of stocks we need and efficient and, more importantly, accurate tool to select areas to focus our portfolio. Fortunately the Zacks Industry Rank is perfectly suited for this task. The Zacks Industry Rank rates industry groups based on the aggregate Zacks Rank of individual stocks within those groups. There are 217 industries and a general rule of thumb is that the top 70 are good areas to invest in. Additionally, Zacks.com has a mutual fund rank that takes all of the guess work out of the equation. Does, it get any easier than that? ETF's are bit simpler than mutual funds and right now miners are ranked fairly high, 38th out of 264 industries. To gain exposure in that area I am looking at SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (XME). The fund uses a passive management style that allows for lower turnover and expenses, as well as more accurate tracking. It may be more volatile than some, with a beta of 1.7, but that goes with the territory when you are investing in this industry. Pharmaceuticals are also doing very well. The PowerShares Dynamic Pharmaceuticals (PJP) ETF will give you just what the doctor ordered. You won't get much diversification, but you will spread your sector bet across 30 U.S. pharmaceutical companies rather than having to pick and choose. Transportation as a whole, particularly rail, offers room to outperform most other sectors. IiShares Dow Jones Transportation Average (IYT) tracks the Dow's transport index, if you could not already tell by the name. Several industries within transportation rank higher than 50th on the Zacks Industry Rank list. Even if you don't want to get industry specific, there are highly rated funds that offer plenty of diversification. ING FMR Diversified Mid Cap (IFDTX) is a top-rated fund that takes a long-term view of capital growth. The fund can have up to a quarter of its assets in foreign companies, so you will get some international diversification. IFDTX offers a bit less volatility than some growth funds, with a beta around 1 and an expense ratio of 1.04%, which is 43 bps better than the category average. We currently have a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) on this fund. If you are more inclined to go for value, that Gabelli Value A (GABVX) is worth a look. The fund seeks out investments in companies that are under valued, obviously, relative to its private market value. GABVX's manager also pays special attention to stocks that are going through a merger or other reorganization. Babelli Value is also a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy). Make Your Life Easier Exchange traded and mutual funds are a godsend for those looking to mitigate company specific risk, but still seek outsized gains. You can leave the stock picking, and subsequent headaches, behind you and simplify your investment style. Bill Wilton is the Aggressive Growth Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.

2010-12-31,Final Trading Hours of 2010  12-31-2010,"Cusick's Corner The key today is do no damage. It's been an incredible month and the market is very quiet, so try not to over analyze the data and headlines today. Also don't interpret any market pullbacks (most likely due to some tax selling) as the beginning of the end or the time to really load up. Consider taking the opportunity to trim losers and look to potentially add some protection, i.e. puts, to your winners as we head into the last hours of trading in 2010. See you After Hours. Major averages are modestly lower, with end-of-year position squaring driving some of the action, but not much volume or volatility seen on the last day of trading in 2010. There have been no economic releases or earnings to guide the action. Consequently, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has traded in a 46-point range and is up four points. The NASDAQ lost 9.50. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) edged up .41 to 17.93. Options volume is very light, as many investors are already away for the New Year holiday. 2 million calls and 1.8 million puts traded through 11:00 ET. Bullish IMAX is seeing relative strength and increasing call activity. Shares are up $3.88 to $30.74 after the UK Daily Mail published a report indicating that Sony might be interested in the Canadian-based movie chain. It's unsubstantiated, but IMAX touched a new 52-week high and options volume is running 18X the average daily. 25,000 calls and 6,240 puts traded in the name, led by increasing action in January 30, 32.5 and 35 calls. These contacts expire in three weeks and some investors appear to be taking new positions on hopes for some sort of announcement in the near-term. Abbott Labs (ABT) adds 51 cents to $48.08 after an article on Seeking Alpha highlighted the stock in an article titled “Ten Stocks Expected to Grow Their Dividends in 2011.” Shares are up and options volume includes 7,100 calls and 2,725 puts. January 48 calls are the most actives, with more than 4,000 traded. Bearish The top options trade today is in Citi (C). Shares are down one penny to $4.75 and one investor bought a block of 50,000 January 4.5 puts at 6 cents per contract. Since open interest is more than 250,000 contracts, the activity might be closing. If opening, it might be to hedge shares in early 2011 or make an outright bearish bet against the bank. Monday's open interest update will probably indicate whether the put purchase is opening or closing. Put volume is picking up in Eaton Corp. (ETN), a Cleveland-based electrical equipment company. Shares are up 76 cents to $101.92 and total options volume is 3X the average daily, with 3,090 puts and only 125 calls traded in the name. Most of the action is in the February 100 and 105 calls, which have traded 1068 and 1317X, respectively. Nearly all traded at the ask and so it appears that some investors are buying puts and bracing for possible weakness in ETN between now and mid-February. Unusual Volume Movers Rare Element (REE) options volume is running 2X the usual, with 35,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 66 percent of the activity, according to data from website WhatsTrading.com. SPDR Metals and Mining ETF (XME) options activity is running 2X the usual, with 26,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 88 percent of the volume. Verigy (VRGY) options volume is 3X the typical levels, with 18,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 100 percent of the activity. Increasing volume is also being seen in Synovus (SNV), Toll Brothers (TOL), and Waste Management (WM). Implied Volatility Movers Rare Element (REE) is giving back some recent gains, but implied volatility remains elevated amid heavy trading in the options market. REE was up nearly 65 percent on the week heading into today's trading session after China cut quotas on rare earth minerals Tuesday. Shares are down 45 cents to $16.29 today and options volume includes 23,000 calls and 12,000 puts. Implied volatility is up another 2 percent to 115 and now up 57.5 percent from a week ago."
2010-12-31,Being Nimble & Disciplined Will Be Key in 2011  12-31-2010,"Cusick's Corner The market did as expected into the After Hours -- nothing. As we look towards 2011, this new year might shape up to be a trading year. Being nimble and disciplined are going to be the keys to trading in 2011 (the market will probably be one in which you will have to reassess your trading approach month over month). I want to thank all of you for following the Xpound newsletter and look forward to bringing you market commentary in 2011. Happy New Year! Trading slowed to a crawl into the final hour of trading for 2010. With no earnings or economic to guide trading, and many investors away for the New Year Holiday, volume and volatility hit the exits as well. The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in a narrow 67-point range today. For the month of December, the Dow was up an impressive 573 points. The industrial average gained 11 percent on the year. Bullish Flow 6,600 calls traded in Synovus Financial (SNV), or 7X the recent average daily volume in the name. Shares are up 3 cents to $2.63 and Feb 2.5 calls are the most actives. 5,075 traded (62 percent ask). While open interest is sufficient to cover, ISEE data (at 1027 contracts or 59 percent of the call volume on ISE) indicate that some customers are buying to open new positions in the Columbus, GA regional bank. In short, the overall flow seems to indicate that investors are buying call options and looking for the stock to move higher between now and mid-February. Bullish order flow was also seen in Abbott Labs (ABT), IMAX, and Waste Management (WM). Bearish Flow Two of the top stock options trades on a very slow day were in Savient Pharmaceuticals (SVNT). Shares, which plummeted 44 percent in mid-October when the company said a review of strategic alternatives failed to find a bidder, are up 8 cents to $11.15. In options action, one strategist sold 7,400 January $10 puts 15 cents and bought 7,400 February $10 puts at 45 cents. This timespread, for a net debit of 30 cents, might be a bet that shares will hold above $10 through the January expiration, which is in three weeks, and then fall from that point forward. However, it's probably a roll by an investor looking to buy an additional month of downside exposure to the pharmaceutical company. They're selling-to-close January puts and buying-to-open February puts. Bearish flow also picked up in Citigroup (C), Eaton Corp. (ETN), and Northern Oil and Gas (NOG). Index Trading 122,000 calls and 158,000 puts traded across the S&P 500 Index (.SPX), CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) and other cash indexes today, which is anemic volume for the index market. There is not much to write about. So, I'll update the comments from yesterday. There hasn't been much volatility lately. The S&P 500 Index traded in another narrow 5-point range and is up less than one point late-Friday. However, the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) is up .38 to 17.90. The actual volatility, or statistical volatility, of the S&P 500 over the past 20 days is now only 6 percent! Therefore, since VIX tracks the expected volatility priced into S&P 500 options, it is forward-looking and suggests that players in the options market expect (are pricing in) the possibility for a substantial increase in volatility heading into 2011. It is very unusual to see VIX almost 3X greater than SPX actual volatility. ETF Trading SPDR Metals and Mining ETF (XME) is flat at $69.02 and options volume is more than 2X the average daily, with 24,000 puts and 3,300 calls traded on the fund. March 60 puts are the most actives after more than 20,000 traded. The top trade is a block of 9,973 traded at $1.42 when the market was $1.36 to $1.42 and appears to have been initiated by a buyer. In fact, all of the volume in those January 60 puts, which are $9 out-of-the-money, traded at the ask. Some fund managers might have initiated the bearish trades to hedge their exposure or protect recent gains in the sector through March 2011. XME is up 47.8 percent since late-August."
2011-01-03,Market is Extended  01-03-2011,"Cusick's Corner This bullish market still has low volatility and is extended, so strategically traders may want to participate in this environment using spreads. Many bulls are potentially looking to buy at-the-money spreads, because the volatility is relatively cheap, and they do not have to lay out as much cash versus buying the stock outright (check out the Bullish BAC activity in the Midday). To further mitigate the premium risk, also consider selling out-of-the money call spreads. This takes advantage of not only taking in premium to offset the purchase price, but also mitigates volatility risk if the long option volatility drops and hurts your long position regardless of how the underlying is doing. There is no meaningful data tomorrow but you should gear up for the employment data that is due out later this week. See you Midday. Major averages finished with gains, but off session highs Monday. The economy was in focus early after a report released in morning trading showed the ISM index of manufacturing activity increasing to 57 in December and for a 17th consecutive month. Separate data from the Commerce Department showed construction spending up 0.4 percent in November, and twice as much as expected. Meanwhile, BofA (BAC) gained 6.4 percent and led the Dow Jones Industrial Average on news of a settlement with Freddie and Fannie. Alcoa (AA) also helped the Dow after Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to Buy. The upgrade comes one week before Alcoa kicks off the fourth quarter earnings-reporting season. AA gained 2.7 percent on the day. In all, 25 Dow stocks moved higher, four finished in the red, and the industrial average added 92 points. The Dow finished 40 points from its best levels. The tech-heavy NASDAQ gained 39. Bullish Flow Some players seized Citi (C) call options in afternoon trading Monday. Shares finished the session up 17 cents to $4.90 and several large blocks of calls traded just after 2:00pm ET. For example, two blocks (25,000x2) of January $5 calls traded at a dime. Another three blocks of 20,000 each also traded at ten cents per contract. In all, the volume in these blocks of Jan $5 calls totaled 110,000. In addition, all traded on the International Securities Exchange [ISE], where sentiment data indicate that an investor bought-to-open a new position. The hefty premium purchase seems to reflect expectations that shares will continue to climb through the January 2011 expiration, which is now 18 days away. Bullish order flow was also seen in KB Homes (KBH), Manitowoc (MTW), and Pepsico (PEP). Bearish Flow Zion Bancorp (ZION) was the subject of a sizeable new position Monday. In morning trading, with shares around $25, the January 25 – 26 strangle traded at $1.19, 9,300X. A buyer initiated the position, and bought 9,300 of both the puts and calls, according to a source on the exchange floor. Volume exceeds open interest in both contracts and so this appears to be a new position. In addition, since the puts are at-the-money and the calls out-of-the-money, the strangle has a net negative delta and is a bearish play on the regional bank. The key to success, however, will be for the stock to make a volatile move in one direction or the other. Bearish flow also picked up in Xilinx (XLNX), Nabors (NBR), and Newell Rubbermaid (NWL). Index Trading Options action in the index market finally picked up after a very slow week of trading in the final five days of 2010. 605,000 calls and 578,000 puts traded on the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) and other cash indices today which is 113 percent the recent average daily, according to Trade Alert data. The top options trades were in the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX). VIX settled down .13 to 17.62 and one investor apparently sells 40,000 January 35 calls at 11 cents to buy 20,000 January 27.5 calls at 29 cents. They also sold 20,000 February 27.5 calls at 86 cents to buy 40,000 February 35 calls at 44.5 cents. This appears to be rolling, and opening a new backspread in the February calls. This position will make its best profits if VIX really rallies before the Feb expiration. ETF Trading SPDR Metals and Mining ETF (XME) puts were active for a second day. As noted in Friday's wrap, 24,000 puts and 3,300 calls traded on the fund on the last day of trading in 2010. March 60 puts are the most actives. The activity continued on the first day of trading of 2011. Shares notched a new 52-week high and finished up $1.33 to $70.11. Options volume included 22,000 puts and 1,165 calls. This time, March 62 puts were the most actives. 13,300 traded and, with 77 percent traded at the asking price, it appears that buyers were initiating the trades. If so, this might be hedging activity or outright bearish bets against the mining and metals names."
2011-01-07,Some Metal/Mining ETFs To Consider ,"If you believe that the metals sector will continue to see outperformance in 2011, then having a portion of your portfolio in the sector is more than beneficial to your financial health. One of the bigger ETFs is SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), which encompasses such stocks as Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF), Massey Energy (NYSE: MEE). The SPDR S&P Metals and Mining charges 35 basis points, the lowest among similar ETFs. It uses its size and scale to compete on price. It has over $1.2 billion in assets. iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials (NYSE: IYM) is another ETF to consider, as it has such holdings as Freeport McMoran (NYSE: FCX), Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM), Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE: BTU) and others. iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials (NYSE: IYM) has a small expense ratio, compared to the other ETFs in the sector. It only charges 47 basis points. The last ETF being mentioned in this article is the largest one, Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLB) It's the largest ETF in the sector, with well over $2 billion under management. It holds such companies as largest holdings being Du Pont (NYSE: DD), Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (NYSE: FCX), Dow Chemical (nyse: DOW) and others. The fund has an expense fee of 21 basis points. I would expect these ETFs to continue to rise over the next 6 months or so, as quantitative easing continues to weaken the dollar, and commodities and those companies associated with them, continue to rise. After 6 months is anybody's guess, because no one is sure what will happen with the Federal Reserve once QE2 is finished. You can also look at some individual metal ETFs, if you believe a particular metal will outperform. Palladium and platinum have performed extremely well since the Fed first announced QE2, and I would expect that the first part of 2011 will be no different. ETFs Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) and ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT) are ways to play these trends. Disclosure: no position in names mentioned"
2011-01-10,ETFs For This Week's Earnings Reports,"This week marks the start of fourth-quarter earnings season and while only a few marquee names are due to report this week, three Dow names to be exact, it never hurts to do a little advanced planning and scope out some ETFs that may move on the back of these profit reports. For Alcoa (NYSE: AA) today after the bell: The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) would be the conservative play as Alcoa gets just over 4% of XME's weight, but the ambitious trader could give the newly minted Global X Aluminum ETF (NYSE: ALUM) a whirl. A good leveraged bet would be the ProShares Ultra Industrials (NYSE: UXI). For Intel (Nasdaq: INTC) Thursday after the close, run with the Semiconductor HOLDRs (AMEX: SMH), which allocates more than 20% of its weight to Intel. If Intel blows out as it has in recent quarters, go big with the Direxion Daily Semicondct Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: SOXL). For JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) Friday before the open: Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF), iShares Dow Jones US Financial Sector ETF (NYSE: IYF) and the Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSE: VFH)."
2011-01-11,"5 ETFs For 2011 (OIH, XME, DBA, XLF, KRE) ","Two sectors that I believe will outperform the major averages in 2011 are commodities and financial stocks. Commodities are in an undeniable, 100% obvious, long-lasting bull market right now. Continued monetary debasement as well as strong growth in emerging markets will drive this theme going forward. The thesis behind financial stocks is the complete opposite of commodities. Financials have been in a bear market for more than 3 years. Furthermore, they lagged the broader market badly in 2010. Simply put, if you think that stocks are the place to be in 2011, you should probably be Overweight financials. On the other hand, if you are a bear, this idea probably will not appeal to you. For most investors, ETFs are the best way to gain exposure to the equity markets. They are inexpensive, liquid, and provide diversified exposure to different sectors and asset classes. Here is a look at 5 ETFs that should be on your radar screen for 2011. Oil Service HOLDRs ETF (NYSE: OIH) - Oil service names were hit hard in the wake of the BP oil spill, but have bounced back strongly in recent months. Over time, the overhang on this sector will continue to recede, and this should help the OIH move higher. This ETF should also benefit from the current bull market in the price of crude oil, which is trading above $90 and could make a run at $100 at some point in 2011. SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) - This is not a complicated pick. The trend is your friend is an old investing adage that many people have a tendency to overcomplicate. In the case of XME, don't be tempted to make this mistake. This ETF is a Buy until the trend is convincingly broken. Demand from Asia along with inflation expectations are driving the metals space right now. PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund ETF (NYSE: DBA) - This is another commodity ETF which gives investors exposure to the theme of higher food prices going forward on account of supply tightness and global demand growth. The agriculture story could last for years or even decades. A rising middle class in emerging economies along with global population growth makes this sector extremely attractive on almost any time horizon. Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE: XLF) - The thesis behind financial stocks is mostly geared towards bullish investors. If the major averages post solid gains in 2011, it is hard to imagine that financials will not be among the leading sectors. There appears to be some fairly significant relative value to be found in financial stocks compared to many other sectors that have already had big runs. As institutional investors become more comfortable with these stocks, we should see some large-scale portfolio re-balancing as they allocate more money into the space. SPDR KBW Regional Banking ETF (NYSE: KRE) - Pretty much the same thesis as with the XLF. If the economy continues to improve, it will benefit the entire banking sector to a significant degree. I am very confident that when we look back at 2011 we will find quite a few regional banking gems that could have been bought on the cheap at the beginning of the year. Financial stocks can be extremely complex to understand, however, so for that reason the best way for most investors to gain exposure to the regional banking sector is through the KRE."

Benzinga recommends you take a look at the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (NYSE: XME)"
2011-07-05,Time For Steel ,"Higher iron ore prices haven't been very kind to global steel producers as of late. Higher production costs have caused several major steel producers to warn on earnings for the second quarter. The latest was Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), which said its second-quarter earnings per share would be about 22 cents less than what Wall Street is expecting. Overall, margins and gross profits for major steelmakers have not followed record steel prices higher. However, now may be the best time for investors to jump into the sector. Long term trends for steel demand are rosy as emerging markets continue to build out their infrastructure. Even in the developed world, steel demand is growing. The World Steel Association estimates that global finished steel consumption will rise 5.3% in 2011. Many analysts are bullish on the sector, citing that the long slump in steel prices is starting to bottom out. Morgan Stanley in a recent research note, said “We think [steel] market fundamentals will begin to turn up by the end of the summer, so any further weakness would be short-lived” and that a “ sector-wide recovery is coming closer.” In addition, many steel producers have begun raising prices for a variety of rolled steel products including rebar and I-beams. For investors, now may be the best time to add the sector to portfolio. Both the PowerShares Global Steel (NASDAQ: PSTL) and Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) offer direct access to the sector and feature some of the world's biggest steel producers. Investors can also use the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (NYSE: XME) which features a 31% weighting to steel."
2011-07-14,Five Mining ETFs Your Broker Forgot To Mention,"When it comes to mining ETFs, know this: There is more to this corner of the ETF globe than just the usual suspects. You already know the usual suspects such as the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL). As is always the case, popularity is not a guarantee of returns and the mining sector is definitely an area where it pays to look off the beaten. Even better is that this approach can be extended to miners of both base and precious metals. With the latter finally showing some signs of life, let's have a look at five mining ETFs your broker probably forget to mention. First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ): Don't let the names deceive you. FXZ really isn't a kissing cousin to an ETF like XME. In fact, FXZ may just be the closest thing to a chemicals industry ETF out there because that sector accounts for over 43% of the ETF's weight. And by chemicals, we don't mean Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) or DuPont (NYSE: DD). This ETF offers exposure to a different, more obscure group of names. FXZ has been trapped in a narrow range between $23.50 and $26 this year, so buy above $26 on a breakout. Rydex S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials ETF (NYSE: RTM): Sick of excessive weights to Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX), DuPont and the like in your materials ETF? Try RTM on for size. Home to 30 familiar materials with no single constituent getting weight larger than 3.72% or less than 3.41%. Equal-weight ETFs do work, but in a taste test between XME and RTM, XME's wins by a wide margin regarding performance. iShares S&P Global Materials ETF (NYSE: MXI): There have been times when we've felt like we were the only ones singing the praises of this ETF, so it may surprise some to learn MXI has soared over 30% in the past year. View MXI this way: Iron demand is forecast to continue rising, especially in the emerging markets. The three largest iron ore makers in the world are Vale (NYSE: VALE), Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP). Those stocks account for 20% of MXI's weight. First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (Nasdaq: PLTM): As good as it when it comes to a platinum mining ETF, PLTM has suffered a similar fate to other precious metal mining ETFs this year. That is a shellacking. Gold and silver mining ETFs have started to show some signs of life recently, but the same cannot be said of PLTM. Not yet anyway. If platinum and palladium prices bounce, maybe the miners will finally join the party. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG): The newest member of the lists, GGGG is just five months old. Home to 30 stocks, the ETF is a legitimate competitor and alternative to GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) as it mixes well-known gold miners with more obscure names. GGGG's anonymous days may be drawing to a close as gold miners have started to rally and the ETF has surged 10% in the past month."

2011-07-26,What's The Dealio?  07-26-2011,"Cusick's Corner This is frustrating, choppy action in the markets today and when they start acting like this you really want to keep your focus and patience on positioning. Gold traders, GLD, are the most frustrated, this market looks like it should just turn over but just has not turned south, and the bid keeps getting nibbled, especially since there is no impasse on the Debt ceiling issue. Tech, QQQ/XLK, and Consumer Discretionary, XLY, are the backbone of this market but I am leery of the Small Caps, IWM, and Financials, XLF. If the Small Caps become pressured and turn course this could be a red flag that a possible distribution could muster strength, keep an eye on the $82 level in the IWM. See you After Hours. Market action is mixed on earnings news today. Broadcom (BRCM) shares rallied 9.8 percent and are among the best gainers in the NASDAQ 100 after the chipmaker's profits topped Street estimates. RadioShack (RSH), Weatherford (WFT), and Baidu.com (BIDU) are also up on earnings news today. However, 3M (MMM) is down 4.7 percent and the biggest loser in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the company posted disappointing results. US Steel (X), Eastman Kodak (EK), and BP are also seeing post earnings weakness. On the economic front, the news was also mixed. While the latest Consumer Confidence report showed a surprise increase to 59.5 in July (from 57.6 in June and compared to 56.0 expected), New Homes Sales fell to an annual rate of 312K in June (from 315K and compared to 320K consensus). At the same time, the underlying tone of trading is cautious amid uncertainty about the implications of a potential US debt default and the ongoing stalemate in Washington over raising the debt ceiling. The Dow is down 63 points, but the tech-heavy NASDAQ added 4.2. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) edged up .46 to 19.81. Trading in the options market is relatively light for a second day this week, with 4.3 million calls and 3.5 million puts traded through 12:30pm ET. Bullish Flow 35,000 calls and 4,740 puts traded in Marvell Technology (MRVL) today. Shares are up 40 cents to $15.69 amid relative strength in the sector after chipmaker Broadcom (BRCM) rallied nearly 10 percent on earnings news. The top options trades in Marvell today are part of a spread, in which the strategist sold 10,500 January 14 calls at $2.62 and bought 10,500 November 16 calls at $1.19. Therefore, they collected $1.43 on the spread. Looking at the historical data, the spread might roll a position in January 14 calls opened on June 20 when the stock was about 17 percent below current levels. The investor might be closing out the position because the Jan 14 call is now in-the-money and opening a new bullish position in the Nov 16 calls, which are slightly out-of-the-money. SPDR Gold Fund (GLD) is flat at $157.34 after the yellow metal gained $1.8 to $1,614 an ounce. GLD is an exchange-traded fund that owns the actual commodity. In options action, one strategist seems to be expecting higher gold prices and initiated a sizeable call spread on the gold ETF today. In late-morning action, 20,000 GLD August 167 calls were bought at 39 cents and 20,000 August 175 calls sold at ten cents. Therefore, the investor paid a 29-cent net debit for the GLD Aug 167 - 175 call spread, 20000X. Volume exceeds open interest in both contracts and so this appears to be a new position. If so, it's an aggressive play. Excluding commissions, the breakeven at expiration is at $167.29, which represents a 6.3 percent rally in gold over the next 24 days. Bearish Flow Homebuilder DR Horton (DHI) shares are down 12 cents to $11.85 after data released Tuesday morning showed New Home Sales falling to an annual rate of just 312,000 in June. Economists were expecting an increased to 320,000 from 315,000 in May. DHI is trading down on the data and options volume in the builder is 8,460 puts and 1,080 calls. August 11 puts, which are 7.2 percent out-of-the-money and expiring in 24 days, are the most actives. 7,570 traded. September $11 puts are seeing interest as well. Some investors are possibly taking positions in downside DHI puts on concerns about further weakness in shares heading into a July 28 earnings report. SPDR Metals and Mining Fund (XME) is trading down $1.38 to $69.93 and options volume in the ETF today is 53,000 puts and 1,410 calls. Much of the put volume is due to one spread trade, in which the investor bought 15,000 September 63 puts at $1.31 and sold 30,000 September 58 puts at 59 cents. Therefore, they paid a 13-cent net debit for this 1X2 put ratio spread and are possibly betting that XME will dip towards $58 through the September expiration. The debit is at risk if shares hold above $63 and there is additional risk to the downside because only half of the Sept 58 puts (which were sold) are covered by the Sept 63 puts (which were bought). Unusual Volume US Steel (X) options volume is running 2X the (22-day) average, with 78,000 contracts traded and call activity accounting for 56 percent of the volume. SPDR Retail Trust (XRT) options volume is 3X the average daily, with 22,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 99 percent of the activity. Weatherford (WFT) options volume is running 3X the average daily, with 56,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 71 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Juniper Networks (JNPR), AK Steel (AKS), and UPS. Implied Volatility Mover Supervalu (SVU) shares are up 68 cents to $9.20 and implied volatility is sharply lower after the grocer reported earnings that topped Street estimates. Options volume is running 4X the average daily, 23,000 puts and 4,570 calls traded in Supervalu so far. The top trade is a 20,000-contract block of SVU August 9 puts sold at 35 cents per contract. It's possibly a closing trade after shares rallied on the earnings results. Meanwhile, implied volatility in Supervalu options is down 27 percent to 48 now that the event risk has passed."
2011-08-18,Bear Claws  08-18-2011,"Cusick's Corner The bear looks to have awoken overseas and equities in the US are responding negatively. This current pummeling took the market down through support levels of 1180 on the S&Ps with the next support level around 1130. In the commodities world I am watching oil today, I thought there might be some buying pressure if 83 holds in the crude contract, but it is below that level now. See you After Hours. Stock market averages tanked Thursday morning, but are off session lows at midday. The table was set for morning weakness on Wall Street after Morgan Stanley cut it estimates on global economic growth and stock benchmarks suffered steep losses across the Eurozone. Germany's DAX paced the decline after plunging 6 percent. The domestic news didn't help much. Data released early showed weekly jobless claims increasing by 9,000 to 408,000 in the period ended August 13. Economists were expecting an increase of 1,000. The latest CPI rose .5 percent, which was .3 percent hotter-than-expected. The list of leading economic indicators for July was up .5 percent and.3 percent more than anticipated. However, the latest Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey was a huge disappointment. It fell to -30.7 in August. Economists were looking for a reading of +1. Market averages fell to session lows on the data and, at its worst levels, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 518 points. It has since pared some of the losses and is off 405. Tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 115. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) surged 9.79 points to 41.37. Options volume is active due to the volatility and the August options expiration, with about 7.5 million calls and 90.5 million puts traded across the exchanges through 1pm ET. Bullish Flow Cisco (CSCO) is down 77 cents to $15.09 and a noteworthy spread trades in the networking giant today. In this strategy, the investor apparently sold 15,000 September 16 calls on CSCO at 27 cents and bought the January 17.5 - 20 call spread at 39 cents, 15000X. The three-way, for a debit of 12 cents, is possibly a roll of a bullish position. That is, the strategist is giving up hopes for a move above $16 through the September expiration, which is in 39 days, and closing out the Sep 16s. But they expect CSCO to perform well through the end of the year and are creating a bullish spread in the January calls - buying the 17.5s at 55 cents and selling the 20s at 16 cents. PowerShares Bullish Dollar Fund (UUP) adds 16 cents to $21.12 after the dollar made strides against other key currencies Thursday. UUP is a bullish play on the dollar and is heavily weighted against the Euro/USD pair and, secondly, the JPY/USD pair. The euro is down .8 percent against the buck today. The yen has added .1 percent. Meanwhile, in UUP options action, one strategist paid 30 cents for December 22 calls on the ETF, 50000X. That is, they bought a massive block of out-of-the-money calls on UUP at 30 cents each and are possibly looking for the dollar to perform well relative to the euro and yen through December. Bearish Flow Bank of America (BAC) shares are down 50 cents to $6.96 and puts on the bank are heavily traded today. Total volume through midday is 347,000 puts and 223,000 calls. November 4 puts, which are 42.5 percent out-of-the-money, are the most actives. 54,989 traded against 10,534 in open interest. One investor bought 25,000 contracts in morning trading, paying 35 cents per contract and apparently opening a new position. Aug 7, Sep 7, and Oct 5 puts are seeing brisk trading as well. Implied volatility in BAC options jumped 38 percent and is elevated at 99.5. Investors appear to be buying puts on the bank amid concerns about further losses in shares in weeks/months ahead. Large block of puts trade on the iShares Taiwan Fund (EWT) Thursday. Shares are down 68 cents to $12.93 on a rough day for global equity markets. In options action, one investor apparently sold 43,580 September 13 puts on EWT at 55 cents and bought 43,580 December 12 puts at 55 cents. The spread, for a net debit of 10 cents, is probably a roll. That is, the investor is closing a position in the in-the-money Sep 13s, but bracing for additional losses and opening a new position in the out-of-the-money Dec 12 puts. Unusual Volume Hewlett Packard (HPQ) options volume is running 2.5X the (22-day) average, with 115,000 contracts traded and call activity accounting for 54 percent of the volume. Oracle (ORCL) options volume is 2X the average daily, with 109,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 71 percent of the activity. Eastman Kodak (EK) options volume is running 2X the average daily, with 86,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 64 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in SPDR Metals and Mining ETF (XME), Salesforce.com (CRM), and Temple Inland (TIN) Implied Volatility Mover CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) surged 9.87 points to 41.45 after the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) sank 52.14 points to 1141.75 today. Fear is high and investors are flocking to safety. Gold surged $27.6 to $1,819.8 and new record highs. The yield on the ten-year Treasury bond, which moves opposite to price, fell to 2 percent and record lows. Investors are buying bonds and gold. Investors are flocking to index puts as well. 722,000 traded on the S&P 500. Consequently, VIX, which tracks expected volatility priced into SPX options, is running higher. Yet, while the market's fear gauge has recaptured the 40 handle, it remains 13.7 percent below the 15-month highs of 48 seen on 8/8."
2011-09-09,Violent Pullback  09-09-2011,"Cusick's Corner This is a violent pullback, at least from the perspective of how hard the selling has come in at the peak of the Midday. Any rally that was potentially in the works after the President's speech last night has been crammed down. I am watching the levels that we are at now, specifically 1155-1160 area -- the market needs to hold these levels into the close otherwise next week could be a tough trade, especially if we fall more at the close. See you After Hours. Stock market averages opened lower and are in the red midday after European equity markets and the euro suffered steep losses on concerns about the debt crisis. Spain's IBEX lost 3.8 percent, Germany's DAX gave up 3.6 percent and France's CAC 40 Index slid 3.2 percent on worries Greece is near default. An unnamed Greek official was out denying the speculation today. Still, the euro has plummeted to multi-year lows against the yen and, after steep losses Thursday, is down another 1.6 percent against the buck today. News that ECB economist Juergen Stark unexpectedly resigned also weighed on European markets. In the US, the economic calendar held just one report on Wholesale Inventories, which was up .8 percent in July and was a non- event for the equity market. The focus is on Europe and players are selling shares into the weekend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 272 points at midday and the tech-heavy NASDQ gave up 48 points. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) rallied to recapture the 40 level and is up 5.15 points to 39.47. Overall options volume is running at a brisk pace and reflects the negative underlying sentiment, with 5.7 million calls and 8 million puts traded across the exchanges through 1:00pm ET. Bullish Flow Yahoo (YHOO) calls are actively traded after the Wall Street Journal Deal Blog reported that the company hired Director Denny to head up a Strategy and Transactions Review committee. Shares ran up to $14.56 as the report made the rounds, but are now down 27 cents to $14.18. One of the top options trades in Yahoo is a spread, in which the strategist bought 500 April 16 puts at $1.64 and sold 500 April 20 puts at 64 cents. That is, the Apr 16 - 20 call spread was initiated for $1 even and this might be a bet that shares will rally through the rest of this year and into the first quarter of 2012. YHOO was in the spotlight earlier this week after the company ousted CEO Carol Bartz. Another 50,000 calls and 20,000 puts traded in YHOO today. A large put spread trades in Barrick Gold (ABX) today. In this spread, the strategist bought 7,500 January 48 puts at $1.98 and sold 7,500 January 2013 52.5 puts at $7.95. That is, the Jan13 52.5 - Jan 48 put spread sold at $5.97, 7500X. With shares down 54 cents to $54.94 today, the action appears to be a roll - or closing out a position in January 48 puts opened on July 22 when the contract was being sold-to-open at $3.10. The strategist is buying it back for a profit and now selling a new position in the longer-dated puts at a higher strike price. Shares of the gold miner are up 21 percent to June and so the spread appears to be an adjustment to a winning trade - rolling out on year and up in strike prices. Bearish Flow Barclay's Bank (BCS) is falling to 52-week lows and was recently down 82 cents to $9.18 on concerns about the European Debt Crisis. Options volume on the London-based financial institution is running 6.5X the average daily, with 50,000 contracts traded in BCS so far. The volume includes 43,000 puts and 7,250 calls. September 6 puts, which are 34.6 percent OTM and expiring at the end of next week, are the most actives. 10,500 traded and, with 57 percent of the volume traded on the bid, some options writers might be selling the contract on the view that a move below $6 over the next week is unlikely. However, it appears that put buyers are driving increased activity in October 6 and 8 put options on BCS. A large block of puts is bought on the SPDR Metals and Mining exchange-traded fund (XME). Shares are down $1.59 to $55.76 and 16,240 January 30s traded at 54 cents. Another 16,235 traded, also at 54 cents. Both blocks traded on the AMEX, where a source on the floor says the position was bought. If so, it's an opening play, as the contract has only 224 in open interest. The Jan 30 put on XME is currently 46.2 percent out-of-the-money and an investor might have initiated the trade to hedge a portfolio of mining stocks. XME holds a number of different names from the sector, including MolyCorp, Royal Gold and Hecla Mining. Unusual Volume PowerShares Bullish Dollar Fund (UUP) options volume is running 2X the (22-day) average, with 83,000 contracts traded and call activity accounting for 97 percent of the volume. CurrencyShares Euro Trust (FXE) options volume is 3X the average daily, with 74,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 73 percent of the activity. Lowe's (LOW) options volume is running 2.5X the average daily, with 39,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 94 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Seagate Technology (STX), JC Penney (JCP), and Abercrombie (ANF). Implied Volatility Mover CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) rallied to recapture the 40 level for the first time since August 26. The market's fear gauge is now up 4.93 to 39.25 and has rallied 24.1 percent during the month of September. Investors are reacting to the increased volatility overseas and showing increased in index options. 665,000 puts and 262,000 calls traded on the S&P 500 Index through midday. Since VIX tracks the expected volatility priced into SPX options, it often moves higher when there is increasing demand for SPX puts - i.e. portfolio protection. Today is no exception."
2011-09-15,Market's Current Built-In Velocity  09-15-2011,"Cusick's Corner Headlines, poor data and the market still goes up. This is the velocity that I mentioned earlier this week -- the direction that the market has the most fear built into it is -- the upside. Going into expiration I am cleaning up my Sept exposure. I have some Euro positions that I am working out of, not adding any new positions for Oct at this stage but am looking at some Energy plays, XLE (thanks David), and some Retail, XRT, after a disappointing sales number, plus we are coming into the early holiday fall shopping season. As I mentioned over the past few Corners, if you have Sept positions on, get the risk tightened up, do not wait until the last minute. optionsXpress will present a free workshop in Denver on Saturday; if you want more info email us at education@optionsxpress.com. See you After Hours. Stock market averages rallied at the open after the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve, and three other central banks agreed to offer European financial institutions with dollar loans. The pledges of liquidity helped spark a rally in European shares before the start of trading in New York. A 3.3 percent advance in France's CAC 40 helped pace the advance. The domestic news was less bullish. Data released early Thursday showed weekly jobless claims increasing by 11,000 to 428,000 in the period ended September 10. Economists were expecting a decline of about 7,000. The Consumer Price Index [CPI] rose .4 percent in August and twice as much as expected. Meanwhile, the NY Empire Manufacturing Index sank to -8.8 in September. Economists were looking for a decline of -4. Industrial Production for August was up .2 percent and .2 percent more than expected. However, the Philadelphia Fed Survey sank to -17.5 in September. Economists had predicted a reading of -10 from the gauge of manufacturing activity. Yet, news of intervention from central banks in Europe and the US overshadowed generally disappointing news on the domestic economic front and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 132 points at midday. The tech-heavy NASDAQ has added 23.5 points. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) lost another 1.58 to 33.02. Options volume is picking up heading into the options expiration. 4.8 million calls and 4.9 million puts traded across the exchanges through 12:30pm ET. Bullish Flow A massive block of puts was sold on the SPDR Financial Fund (XLF). Shares are up 20 cents to $12.80 after shares of many of the banks rallied on news Central Banks in the US and Europe are offering European financial institutions with dollar loans. In options action, early trades in the XLF include a 73,000-contract block of October 11 puts at 18 cents per contract on the ISE. It was a liquidating trade, based on data from the exchange. Similar trades were seen October puts in a variety of sector exchange-traded funds including the SPDR Retail Trust (XRT), the SPDR Industrials (XLI), and the SPDR Metals and Mining ETF (XME). One or more investors were apparently closing out defensive or bearish positions on these exchange-traded funds, perhaps betting that Central Bank intervention into the banking sector will result in lower levels of market volatility in the weeks ahead. An interesting spread trades in Temple Inland (TIN) today. Shares are up 11 cents to $31.29 and one strategist bought 20,000 February 30 calls at $1.80 and sold 20,000 February 32 calls at 10 cents. In other words, a Feb 30 - 32 call spread is bought at $1.70, 20000X. The position looks opening and seems to be a bet that International Paper's bid for the company will close before the February expiration. IP is offering $32 per share in cash for TIN and, if the deal closes before the Feb options expire, the spread will be worth $2, an increase of 17.7 percent. The risk is that the deal doesn't go through and TIN remains below $31.70(breakeven of spread) through the Feb 2012 expiration. The entire debit is at risk (plus transaction costs) if shares fall below $30. Bearish Flow Dollar Tree (DLTR) rallied to record highs today and is up $1.24 to $76. Options volume in the retailer is running 3X the daily average. 11,000 calls and only 290 puts traded in the name today. The top trade is a 6,645-contract block of October 80 calls, which was sold-to-open at $1.15. 8,827 now traded against existing open interest of 199 contracts. The flow is not necessarily bearish, but seems to reflect expectations that shares will hold below $80 (+5.3%) through the October expiration (36 days). Deutsche Bank initiated the stock with a Buy and an $81 price target today. Quest Diagnostics (DGX) sees relative weakness and increased options activity today. Shares are down $1.64 to $47.71 and options volume is running 19X the daily average, with 5,135 puts and only 10 call options traded in the name today. The top trade is a spread, in which the strategist apparently bought 2,400 Jan 45 puts on the medical laboratory company at $2.45 and sold 2,400 Jan 35 puts at 35 cents. In other words, they initiated a Jan 35 - 45 put spread for a $2.10 net debit and seem to be expecting additional weakness in shares through January 2012. No news on the stock to explain the losses and bearish flow in DGX today. Unusual Volume NetFlix (NFLX) options volume is running 3X the (22-day) average, with 173,000 contracts traded and put activity accounting for 51 percent of the volume. Temple Inland (TIN) options volume is 3X the average daily, with 58,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 99 percent of the activity. Tiffany (TIN) options volume is running 7X the average daily, with 50,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 97 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Best Buy (BBY), Ecolab (ECL), and Express Scripts (ESRX). Implied Volatility Mover UBS is down $1.40 to $11.28 and falling to new 52-week lows on news a rogue trader has cost the bank approximately $2 billion losses. Meanwhile, options volume in UBS is running 14X the daily average. 12,000 calls and 10,000 puts traded in the name so far. October and December 12 calls are the most actives. Implied volatility in options on the Swiss bank is up about 6 percent to 73."

2011-09-22,Market Ugly  09-22-2011,"Cusick's Corner Today we are experiencing a broad based sell-off globally and there is no safety net. This is real liquidation of risk that includes Gold, Silver, Copper and Equities. What is surprising about this move is the velocity of this action but the trend is now ugly and down. The Dollar, DXZ 11 78.995 +1.12, is a flight to safety trade at this juncture as the Fed and the rest of the world sees risks to the economy. At the midday the market is near lows of 1123 in the S&Ps -- need to hold these levels otherwise if broken we could see a very scared trade the downside. If the market can bounce from here into the end of the day, S&Ps to 1130-1140 level, there will be pressure taken off of the longs. See you After Hours. Stocks are reeling Thursday morning. The selling began late-Wednesday after the Federal Reserve concluded its meeting on monetary policy and offered a bleak view on the economy. Fed officials noted significant downside risks and announced plans to buy longer-term Treasury bonds to keep rates at low levels. There is concern that the Fed is running out of policy options to help revive a sputtering US economy. Wednesday's late day sell off on Wall Street spilled over to equity markets across Asia and Europe. The euro also fell and dipped below 1.35 on the buck amid worries about ongoing worries about European debt problems. Action is volatile across some of the commodities market as well. Crude oil lost more than $4 to $81.85 per barrel and gold gave up $81.3 to $1,724.5 an ounce. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 300 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 47.4 points. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) added 2.13 to 39.45. Overall options volume is more active than previous days, with 4.5 million calls and 4.2 million puts traded across the exchanges through 10:50am ET. Bullish Flow Yahoo (YHOO) is seeing some resilience today after Stifel Nicolaus raised the stock to Buy and upped YHOO's price target to $18. YHOO is up 12 cents to $14.08. Options volume on the Internet giant so far includes 76,000 calls and 11,000 puts. Typical volume through the first 90 minutes is about 35,000 contracts. The top trade is a 13,700 contract block of October 17 calls at 42 cents when the market was 38 to 39 cents. It appears to be a large call buyer. November 16 calls are the most actives. 15,250 traded. October 15, 16, and 18 calls on Yahoo are seeing brisk trading as well. The top options trade early Thursday was a 48,000-contract block of January 47 calls on the iShares Emerging Fund (EEM). It was bought at 21 cents per contract and probably closes out a position opened last week, when a massive January 42 - 47 call spread was bought at $1.70, 100,000X. Today's call buyer is probably closing out about half the short leg of the spread after a 10 percent decline in the stock. They're not left holding a bullish position in a 2X1 call spread and possibly anticipating a rebound in the emerging markets through early-2012. Bearish Flow CREE is down $2.11 to $29.73 and 12,000 puts traded on the LED-maker today. Typical put volume through the first 90 minutes is about 4,000 and call activity has amounted to 1,420 contracts. The top trades are part of a spread, in which the strategist apparently bought 4,200 October 27.5 puts at $1.80 and sold 4,200 October 22.5 puts at 50 cents. The spread, for a $1.30 net debit, is a bearish play. It makes its best profits if shares fall to $22.5 or less through the October expiration, which represents at 24.3 percent decline over the next 29 days. The stock is already down 54.9 percent year-to-date. Spread trading is being seen in the SPDR Metals and Mining ETF (XME) today. Shares are down $2.91 to $47.61 and it appears that one investor sold 2,500 October 52 - 48 put spreads at $2.30, 2500X. A bit later, an October 42 - 45 put spread is apparently bought at $1.01, 3900X. The activity is perhaps rolling. That is, after a two-month 35 percent plunge in shares, the strategist is selling-to-close a position in in-the-money October put spreads and buying a new position in Oct out-of-the-money put spreads. XME is an ETF that holds shares of metals and mining companies. Unusual Volume Weatherford (WFT) options volume is running 3X the (22-day) average, with 46,000 contracts traded and call activity accounting for 90 percent of the volume. BHP options volume is 2.5X the average daily, with 23,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 65 percent of the activity. Goodrich (GR) options volume is running 3X the average daily, with 21,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 69 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Gannett (GCI), Total (TOT), and iShares Taiwan Fund (EWT). Implied Volatility Mover Goodrich (GR) implied volatility plummeted today. Shares are up $11.34 to $120.83 on news the company reached an agreement with United Technologies to be acquired for $127.5 per share. 22,000 calls and 9,070 puts traded in GR on the news. Meanwhile, implied volatility in the options is down 83 percent to 6.5, as the market seems to see a high probability of the deal going through."
2011-12-13,How to Profit from ManpowerGroup's Positive Jobs Report,"The job outlook at American employers is the most promising that it has been since 2008 but uncertainty is also on the rise, according to the Manpower Employment Outlook survey for the the 1st quarter of 2012. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin based temporary staffing firm released its quarterly employment outlook report on Tuesday and said that when seasonal adjustments were factored into its survey results that the net employment outlook for the first quarter of 2012 climbed to +9%, up from the previous quarter's employment outlook of +7%. ManpowerGroup (NYSE: MAN) surveyed 18,000 employers to find out about their plans for hiring in the upcoming quarter. The survey found that 70% of employers expected employee numbers to remain the same during the next quarter, 14% of employers plan to increase staff levels and only 9% of those surveyed planned staffing reductions. ManpowerGroup's net employment outlook improved from +5% to +9% when seasonal adjustments were taken into account. Another bright spot in the report from ManpowerGroup is that the company has now seen nine consecutive quarters of positive hiring outlook, after it reported three negative quarters during 2009. The report also marked the first time since the first quarter of 2011 that ManpowerGroup observed a quarter-over-quarter rise in employers' hiring plans. ManpowerGroup also said that uncertainty was on the rise because the amount of employers who were unsure of their hiring plans for the next quarter surged to 7%, up from the previous quarter's 3%. The dramatic rise was the biggest quarterly jump that ManpowerGroup has reported since 1977. It also represented the biggest percentage of uncertain employers that ManpowerGroup has reported since 2005. ManpowerGroup's President of the Americas Jonas Prising said that slow, but steady momentum has improved employer confidence, which is likely why more employers are planning to hire in the first quarter. Mr. Prising went on to caution that “this uptick is encouraging, but the historically high proportion of employers that are unsure of their hiring plans indicates continued uncertainty about the future and ongoing caution when it comes to staffing plans.” The takeaway from the Manpower Employment Outlook survey is generally positive because if employers overall plans to increase hiring reduces unemployment, consumers should start spending more, which could lead to more job growth as companies increase hiring further to meet increased demand. However, it should be noted that while overall employment should move higher, the overwhelming majority of employers have no plans to increase their staff levels. What might be more interesting to investors is that the planned hiring increases are much higher in some industries than in others. The two sectors with the most optimistic hiring plans were Mining, which had an employment outlook of +16%, and Leisure & Hospitality, which had an employment outlook of +14%. On the other hand, Construction was the only sector whose employers reported plans to reduce staffing levels, with an employment outlook of -7%. There are a number of ways for investors to trade on the information contained in the Manpower Employment Outlook survey for the the 1st quarter of 2012. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that the optimistic outlook for the Mining and the Leisure & Hospitality sectors is a positive sign for those industries might want to consider the following trades: The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Powershares Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment Portfolio Fund (NYSE: PEJ) are three ETFs that could climb higher if the expected staffing increases lead to sales growth in either of these two sectors.Bearish:Traders who believe that the Construction sector's plan to cut jobs in the next quarter is a bad sign may consider some alternate positions:You might want to stay away from ETFs like the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE: XHB) and the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index Fund (NYSE: ITB) and instead short stocks like D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI), Shaw Group (NYSE: SHAW) and Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR). If ManpowerGroup's report that the hiring outlook for the Construction sector is looking grim is a sign that construction stock prices could move lower in the next quarter, shorting these stocks could prove to be profitable.Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-12-14,Looking to Play a Rally? Buy Joy Global ,"Shares of mining equipment maker Joy Global (NYSE: JOY) are among the worst performing stocks on Wednesday, falling 11.73% to $74.62. The company released its fiscal fourth quarter earnings results this morning prior to the opening bell. On an adjusted basis, net income was up 33% to $193.7 million or $1.82 per share. This compared to analysts' consensus EPS estimates of $1.86. Net sales were up 27.3% to $1.34 billion versus $1.05 billion in the year ago period. This also missed Wall Street expectations. Analysts had consensus revenue estimates for JOYG of $1.35 billion coming into the report. Looking ahead to fiscal 2012, the company sees EPS between $7.00 and $7.40 on revenue of $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion. Wall Street analysts currently have fiscal 2012 EPS estimates of $7.19 per share on revenue of $5.36 billion. Joy Global's President and CEO also had some cautious comments regarding demand in 2012. He said, We expect demand to grow at a more moderate rate in 2012, and our focus will be on long term growth and efficiencies. ….This will enable us to continue improving margins even with the pressures that will come from a slower market. ... we will continue to move ahead with our capacity upgrades and expansion plans to meet the long term needs of our customers. So, JOYG missed earnings and revenue estimates and the CEO said that he sees lower demand in 2012...Why buy the stock? Joy Global might make a lot of sense for traders looking to play a quick bounce in the stock market heading into the end of the week. The reason is because the name and the overall market are both quite oversold on a near-term basis. JOYG shares have fallen almost 17% in just the last three days. Today's earnings report could end up being a crescendo in near-term negative sentiment surrounding the name. Furthermore, the price of JOYG shares is very sensitive to the outlook for the global economy. If near-term sentiment in JOYG is hitting a tipping point, and the market retraces some of this week's losses on Thursday and Friday, this name could pop. This is a speculative idea, so traders should put in a tight stop if entering the name on the long side. The $74 level would be a natural area to stop out of the trade. Also, JOYG has broken a near-term support level this week, so any bounce may be short-lived. Therefore, the timeframe for this trade should only be a couple of days at most.

2011-12-15,John Paulson: Europe Needs ECB Firewall ,"In a Financial Times op-ed, Billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson argues that the ECB should guarantee European sovereign debt in order to stabilize markets and allow distressed countries time to restructure their budgets. Like many others, Paulson is clearly frustrated with the effect that the European debt crisis has had on financial markets over the last year. In fact, it is possible that no one has lost more money as a result of the less-than-optimal investing atmosphere that has been driven in part by the crisis. Paulson, who solidified his reputation as an elite money manager during the mortgage crisis when he made billions betting against shaky subprime credit instruments, has had an absolutely abysmal year after betting big on a robust recovery in the United States. A number of his hedge funds have fallen more than 40% year-to-date according to investors. Paulson writes that “It is clear that existing, piecemeal efforts by European leaders have been ineffective. Even after the ECB bought €208bn of European debt, Greece, Portugal and Ireland all still required bail-outs. Italian and Spanish yields, meanwhile, remain stubbornly high.” Paulson's idea, which is not exactly unique, is to basically rout the markets via the ECB in what has basically become a game of chicken between the EU and investors. The ECB would fully guarantee all sovereign debt in return for a 1% annual guarantee fee and compliance with ECB/IMF structural reform mandates. He argues that such a program would allow large, troubled countries such as Italy and Spain to refinance their debt at below current market costs which are unsustainable. Paulson believes that these countries all-in-financing costs would be in the 4% range. Furthermore, such a measure would allow countries time to implement much needed reforms. The other argument that Paulson makes is that the guarantees would never likely need to be used. The simple mechanism of an all-in ECB backstop would drive interest rates down to manageable levels. Paulson clearly views the current situation as untenable. “Time is running out for the euro. “A comprehensive firewall is needed now, before the crisis gets worse.” The problem with Paulson's plan is that it basically has been rejected repeatedly - primarily by Germany. Without German support, such a liquidity bazooka is not going to happen. It also would require the ECB to totally distort its mandate, which is price stability. In order for Paulson's firewall to be implemented, the Europeans would to have to agree to basically scrap the ECB's mandate and let the central bank engage in unlimited bond buying with printed money, or at least signal to the markets that it is willing to do this. The burden of such a move would fall, in large part, on the back of German productivity and could spark inflation. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that the ECB bazooka solution is likely might want to consider the following trades: Buying gold. Unlimited ECB bond buying would be similar to programs implemented by the Federal Reserve in the U.S., which have sent gold skyward in recent years.Going long stocks. An ETF such as the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ), which tracks the performance of the Nasdaq 100, would likely rally in the wake of plan similar to Paulson's.Commodity ETFs such as the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) and the United States Oil Fund ETF (NYSE: USO) also could rise if the ECB goes all-in.Bearish:Traders who believe that the European situation will continue to deteriorate without a comprehensive solution may consider alternative positions:Shorting U.S. and European financial stocks. This trade has been a home run in 2011, and a bottom in the near-term does not appear likely without a comprehensive solution to Europe's debt woes.Short the EUR/USD. The euro continues to plunge, and it is conceivable that the decline is just getting started. We could be on the precipice of a full-blown global currency crisis. For now at least, the Dollar looks relatively attractive.Buy way out of the money LEAP put options on an ETF such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY). If a 2008 style global crisis develops in 2012, the S&P could easily be headed for a decline of 35% or better in the coming year.Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2012-03-29,A long-term observation of metals and mining stocks,"by Michael Tarsala, CMT Fears of a China economic slowdown appear to be weighing on the metals and mining sector, although it remains to be seen how long this group will underperform the rest of the stock market. The chart below shows how much metals and mining stocks, represented by the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (XME), have lagged the S&P 500 since late February. Source: Google Finance Individual stocks in the group are showing negative charts. Most of the ones you'll see here are breaking down from triangle patterns, something technical analysts believe points to the possibility of more declines. What's weighing on this group is economic worries about China, says investment advisor Josh Brown, who has been negative on the group for much of the year. He wrote this week, I can't think of any reason why you'd want to be leaning into this sector, and the valuation arguments are not compelling. ... Right now I think they're in no-man's land and earnings revisions will be to the downside if China deteriorates even further. Yet here's something long-term investors might want to think about and watch. What you'll see in the chart below is the performance of XME, in blue, and the S&P 500, in red. Source: Google Finance You'll notice two periods where XME significantly lagged the overall market's performance. One was roughly an eight-month period starting in 2006 and early 2007. The other was another seven-to-eight-month period starting in the fall of 2008, as stock markets began to stabilize after the crash. As Brown points out, there is little evidence to suspect XME outperformance again soon. That said, it will be interesting to watch for signs that a lagging XME relative to the S&P 500 could again be roughly a 7-to-8-month phenomenon. Covestor Ltd. is a registered investment advisor.

2012-05-24,Yesterday's Rally Explained,"Yesterday was a wild day. Stocks were down all day until the European close, and then the market started to rip. The S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) had a 1.9% intraday swing, led at first by news, but then it was just a large short squeeze. Look at the sectors that rallied hard: miners +6% (NYSE: XME), energy +2.6% (NYSE: XLE), and financials +2% (NYSE: XLF) (intraday moves). Also small cap stocks surged (NYSE: IWM). The point is that yesterday's strength was just a few good headlines out of Europe combined with the Fed's Kocherlakota (constant hawk) saying that the Fed has the tools to deal with any EU spillover (boosted QE hopes). Gold climbed 1.6% confirming this. The point is that yesterday was nothing other than a hope-filled short squeeze rally. Do note that yesterday, some big name stocks reclaimed some important levels. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) recouped the $7 level and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) recouped the $570 level, which I said yesterday was major resistance here, and I would have been stopped out had I actually acted on my suggestions. However, Apple is back below $570 currently at $567.53 and this may be a good time to get back in and short."
2012-06-19,Short US Steel Before Pensions Go Bust,"Some stocks are more dangerous than others. In an anemic economic environment, the most dangerous stocks are those with issues that are lurking behind the scenes or in footnotes. Too often, investors are willing to invest without much diligence when times are good. But when times get tough, more are willing to roll up their sleeves and do some old-fashioned analysis. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) is an example of a stock that could see significant additional downward pressure as more investors become aware of the $5.2 billion in liabilities related to its “Pension Benefits”, “Other Benefits” and “Other postemployment benefits” plans, which I will bundle under the term “pensions” for the remainder of this article. A loophole in GAAP accounting minimizes, at least temporarily, the impact of big pension liabilities on reported earnings. Eventually, however, these issues can hurt earnings and surprise investors if the company does not take measures to get them under control. In a challenging economic environment, taking appropriate measures is not always feasible. As Warren Buffett famously said, “when the water is drained out of the pool, you see who is not wearing trunks”. My fear is that US Steel’s pension liabilities will eventually manifest in downward earnings revisions that will drive the stock down. Accounting loopholes can provide a short-term boost to earnings, but they can also lead to a long-term drag or possible bankruptcy. Eastman Kodak (EKDKQ.PK) used the same trick to prop up its 2010 earnings, and now it is bankrupt just as I predicted in my March 2011 article “Dead Company Walking: Sell Eastman Kodak”. Pension Accounting Boosts EPS US Steel boosted its 2011 earnings by increasing its expected return on plan assets (“EROPA”) assumption for its pensions to 7.79%[1], up from 7.75% in 2010. Page F-40 in US Steel’s 2011 10-K filing has the details. An EROPA of 7.79% is abnormally high. Out of the 1,021 companies with pensions that I cover, 90% of them have a lower EROPA. Only 96 of the 1,021 raised their EROPAs in 2012 while 525 lowered and 400 made no changes. US Steel’s EROPA assumption is not only among the highest but it is also rising when the majority is falling. Raising its EROPA in 2012 looks worse when compared to my estimates of the company’s actual return on plan assets. I estimate 2011’s actual return on plan assets was 4.96%. I estimate the average return over the last five years is also 4.96%. Over the last ten years, it is 6.30%. These estimates are based on dividing the “Actual return on plan assets” by the “Beginning balance” of plan assets. You can replicate my analysis using data from the company’s annual reports as detailed in the model used to calculate the actual return on plan assets, which is based on data from the 2001 – 2011 10-Ks. US Steel’s investor relations contact, Dan Lesnak, asserted that the company’s EROPA assumption was not high compared to actual historical returns. When I shared my analysis of the actual returns going back to 2001, he said that I was not looking at a long enough time horizon. When I asked for the appropriate time horizon, he would not provide one. Nevertheless, Mr. Lesnak’s assertion is consistent with this statement on page 57 of the 10-K in reference to using a 7.75% EROPA for 2012: “Actual returns since the inception of the plans have exceeded this 7.75 percent rate and while some recent annual returns have not, it is U. S. Steel’s expectation that rates will return to this level in future periods.” In my opinion, that is a rather big expectation given that 30-40% of plan assets are in corporate bonds, Treasury bonds and government-backed mortgages, which are not offering yields anywhere near 7.75%. The remainder of plan assets are in equities, which will have to earn 9.8% for the portfolio return to be 7.75% assuming a 70/30 equity/fixed income split and a 3% yield on the fixed income. I think most professional money managers would be happy with 9.8% return over the same long-term time frame assumed for the EROPA. Pensions Can Have Big Impact On EPS And Cash Since US Steel’s pensions are so large, its pension costs play a prominent role in earnings, much more so than most companies. US Steel’s net periodic benefit cost (the cost attributable to pensions with the current EROPA reported in GAAP earnings) is over 3% of revenue. We cannot analyze how large a part of net income the net periodic benefit expense is because X’s net income was negative in 2011. However, given that net income margins are at best in the high single digits, it is safe to say that, at 3% of revenue, US Steel’s net periodic benefit cost has a big impact on the company’s financial bottom line. A high EROPA enables US Steel to lower the costs it must report in earnings for paying into its pensions. In turn, the company’s overall expenses are lower and accounting earnings are higher. A 0.5% decrease in US Steel’s EROPA would wipe away $0.23 per basic shares outstanding. A 0.5% reduction to a 7.29% EROPA would be below the median (7.5%) EROPA for the 1,021 pensions we analyzed. It would still be significantly above my estimate of the company’s actual return on plan assets over the last ten years. Note that US Steel has been making significant cash contributions, not reflected in EPS, to its pensions. In 2011, the company contributed $626 million to its pension obligations, compared to $534 million in 2010 and $658 million in 2009. Those are big numbers, especially to maintain over a long period, for a company whose reported cash flows were negative in 2011 and 2010. Since 2009, the company’s cash and cash equivalents declined from $1,218 million to $408 million at the end of fiscal 2011. Pensions Are Underfunded by $5.2 billion US Steel’s pensions were under-funded by $5.2 billion as of 12/31/2011. The sum of the “net funded status” for the “Pension Benefits” and “Other Benefits” plans on page F-38 of the company’s 2011 10-K shows $5.1 billion in underfunded status. An additional $100 million in underfunded obligations to employees is found near the bottom of page F-48. All together, $5.2 billion is about 1.5 times the company’s market cap. For comparison, American Airlines’ (AAMRQ.PK) pensions were underfunded by $8.1 billion coming out of 2010, and it filed bankruptcy about 11 months later with its pensions underfunded by about $10 billion, not a good precedent for US Steel. Part of the increase in the underfunded level of X’s pension is due to lower discount rates used to determine the value of its pension obligations. These discount rates are based on “certain corporate bond rates” according to page 57 in the 2011 10-K. The discount rate in 2011 was lowered to 4.5% from 5.0% for most of its “pension” liabilities. Accordingly, a meaningful rise in corporate bond rates would meaningfully reduce the pension obligations and the underfunded level of US Steel’s pensions. Such a rise would be a welcome sign as would also likely correspond with a rebound in economic activity. I am not sure, however, if we can expect either anytime in the next couple of years. Doubtful That US Steel Can Grow Its Way Out Of Its Liabilities If US Steel were in a high growth industry with excellent prospects for future profits, one could argue that the company could eventually earn its way out of the underfunded pensions hole. That is a tough argument for a company in such a competitive and low margin business. Worse yet, my financial model suggests that US Steel is more unprofitable than reported GAAP earnings suggest, even if one assumes its EROPA is fair and accurate. Figure 1 compares US Steel’s economic earnings to its accounting earnings. In 2011, US Steel reported -$53 million in accounting losses while I believe the company’s losses were closer to -$1,050 million. Figure 1: Accounting Profits Are Not Truly Indicative Of Financial Health Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings One of the largest drivers of the differences in reported accounting and economic earnings for US Steel is $1.1 billion in off-balance sheet reserves (about 33% of the company’s market cap). In addition, US Steel is in a very capital-intensive business and generates relatively little cash compared to the amount of invested capital in the business. From where I sit, the company is in a tough spot. It is not making much, if any, money and its liabilities are formidable: pensions at $5.2 billion plus total debt of $4.4 billion equals $9.6 billion. Stock Valuation Could Suffocate Under Looming Liabilities Assuming that US Steel’s liabilities do not increase, equity investors should be intimidated by the $9.6 billion in existing liabilities that have a senior claim on the company’s future profits. If US Steel does generate future profits, those profits have to be large enough to cover the $9.6 billion in senior claims plus the expectations baked into the current stock price before equity investors can make significant money in US Steel. For those that say all of this information is already baked into the stock price, I suggest you look again. According to my discounted cash flow model, to justify the stock valuation at $18.41/share, the company has to grow its after-tax cash flow (NOPAT) by 9% compounded annually for over 15 years. That is a rather high growth rate for a long time for a commodity business. I underscore that those are the expectations baked into the current stock price. For investors to believe US Steel deserves a higher valuation/stock price, they must believe that the company’s future profit growth will be even greater than that baked into the current stock price. I would say the odds are rather low that US Steel can meet the current expectations baked into the stock price and the odds are rather high the company’s future profits will be much lower than what the market expects. Footnotes Diligence Pays In summary, using the footnotes to lift the accounting veil on US Steel’s financial situation reveals some earnings and liabilities issues for a stock that is already expensive and could suffer downward pressure when investors become more aware of these issues.

2012-07-12,Top 10 Commodity Producers ETFs,"Commodity-based companies and associated ETFs are critically important as a gauge of economic health and demand, inflation and should be important additions to most investment portfolios. Underlying commodity prices can be affected by many factors including the level of the U.S. dollar which can depress prices when strong. With inflation pressures waxing and waning many believe it’s important to have exposure to commodity oriented stocks and ETFs. Nevertheless, even if underlying commodity prices rise, commodity related common stocks and linked ETFs may or may not follow suit. This makes investment timing that much more important. We feature a technical view of conditions from monthly chart views. Simplistically, we recommend longer-term investors stay on the right side of the 12 month simple moving average. When prices are above the moving average, stay long, and when below remain in cash or short. Some more interested in a fundamental approach may not care so much about technical issues preferring instead to buy when prices are perceived as low and sell for other reasons when high; but, this is not our approach. Members to the ETF Digest receive added signals when markets become extended such as DeMark triggers to exit overbought/oversold conditions.

However, given that we’re sorting these by both short and intermediate issues we have split the rankings as we move from one classification to another. Strong established linked index Excellent consistent performance and index tracking Low fee structure Strong portfolio suitability Excellent liquidity Established linked index even if “enhanced” Good performance or more volatile if “enhanced” index Average to higher fee structure Good portfolio suitability or more active management if “enhanced” index Decent liquidity Enhanced or seasoned index Less consistent performance and more volatile Fees higher than average Portfolio suitability would need more active trading Average to below average liquidity Index is new Issue is new and needs seasoning Fees are high Portfolio suitability also needs seasoning Liquidity below average This sector overall responds to perceived and real economic conditions. Should investors sense an economic slowdown demand for base commodities will decline and so too will associated stocks. Conversely, should investors believe an economic expansion is underway then products and stocks should rally. Uniquely, the level of the U.S. dollar is also another important determinant as to price action given commodities overall are priced in dollars. A strong dollar in the current environment should mean a decline in commodity prices and vice versa. It’s important to remember also when the overall stock market declines so too may this sector even if commodity prices are rising. It’s also important to remember that ETF sponsors have their own competitive business interests when issuing products which may not necessarily align with your investment needs. New ETFs from highly regarded and substantial new providers are also being issued. These may include Charles Schwab’s ETFs and Scottrade’s Focus Shares which both are issuing new ETFs with low expense ratios and commission free trading at their respective firms. These may also become popular as they become seasoned.

2012-07-13,Best & Worst ETFs & Mutual Funds: Materials Sector,"The Materials sector ranks fifth out of the ten sectors as detailed in my sector roadmap. It gets my Neutral rating, which is based on aggregation of ratings of 11 ETFs and 11 mutual funds in the Materials sector as of July 12, 2012. Reports on the best & worst ETFs and mutual funds in every sector and style are here. Figure 1 shows the five best and worst-rated Materials ETFs and Figure 2 ranks from best to worst the nine Materials mutual funds that meet our liquidity standards. Not all Materials sector ETFs and mutual funds are created the same. The number of holdings varies widely (from 30 to 156), which creates drastically different investment implications and ratings. The best ETFs and mutual funds allocate more value to Attractive-or-better-rated stocks than the worst ETFs and mutual funds, which allocate too much value to Neutral-or-worse-rated stocks. To identify the best and avoid the worst ETFs and mutual funds within the Materials sector, investors need a predictive rating based on (1) stocks ratings of the holdings and (2) the all-in expenses of each ETF and mutual fund. Investors need not rely on backward-looking ratings. My fund rating methodology is detailed here. Investors should not buy any Materials ETFs or mutual funds because none get an Attractive-or-better rating. If you must have exposure to this sector, you should buy a basket of Attractive-or-better rated stocks and avoid paying undeserved fund fees. Active management has a long history of not paying off. See ratings and reports on all ETFs and mutual funds in this sector on my free mutual fund and ETF screener. Figure 1: ETFs with the Best & Worst Ratings – Top 5 * Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNA’s less than 100 million for inadequate liquidity. Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings PowerShares Dynamic Basic Materials (NYSE: PYZ) is excluded from Figure 1 because its total net assets (TNA) are below $100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards. Figure 2: Mutual Funds with the Best & Worst Ratings – Top 5 (where available) * Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNA’s less than 100 million for inadequate liquidity. Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings ICON Funds: ICON Materials Fund (NYSE: ICBMX) and ICON Funds: ICON Materials Fund (NYSE: ICBCX) are excluded from Figure 2 because their total net assets (TNA) are below $100 million and do not meet our liquidity standards. iShares S&P North American Natural Resources Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IGE) is my top-rated Materials ETF and Fidelity Select Portfolios: Fidelity Advisor Materials Fund (NYSE: FMFEX) is my top-rated Materials mutual fund. Both earn my Neutral rating. SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) is my worst-rated Materials ETF and ICON Funds: ICON Materials Fund (NYSE: ICBAX) is my worst-rated Materials mutual fund. Both earn my Dangerous rating. Figure 3 shows that 49 out of the 232 stocks (over 28% of the total net assets) held by Materials ETFs and mutual funds get an Attractive-or-better rating. However, there are not any Materials ETFs or Materials mutual funds that get an Attractive-or-better rating. The takeaway is: Materials ETFs and mutual funds are not picking the right stocks and are undeserving of their fees no matter how small. Figure 3: Materials Sector Landscape For ETFs, Mutual Funds & Stocks Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings As detailed in “Cheap Funds Dupe Investors”, the fund industry offers many cheap funds but very few funds with high-quality stocks, or with what I call good portfolio management. I do not recommend that investors buy any Materials ETFs or mutual funds. Instead, I would recommend buying a basket of individual Attractive-or-better rated Materials stocks. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc. (NYSE: FCX) is one of my favorite stocks held by Materials ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Very Attractive rating. Freeport-McMoRan is one of the largest copper, gold, and molybdenum mining companies in the world. Although investors often assume that mining companies trade according to the price movements of the commodities they produce, not all Materials companies generate the same profits per ounce of gold or pound of copper. In that regard, FCX is one of the best. FCX’s ROIC is 16.2%, meaning that it generates higher returns on invested capital than 86% of other Materials companies. Despite fluctuations in commodity prices, FCX earned a ROIC that beat its WACC in each of the last 7 years, generating the economic profits that drive shareholder value. Furthermore, the market is pricing Freeport-McMoRan as if its operating profitability will permanently decline by 48%. This pessimistic valuation makes a highly profitable company like FCX a Very Attractive stock right now. Weyerhaeuser (NYSE: WY) is one of my least favorite stocks held by Materials ETFs and mutual funds and earns my Dangerous rating. Weyerhaeuser has not earned a ROIC that beat its WACC a single time in the 14 years I have covered the company. In fact, WY’s ROIC at 2.1% places it in the bottom 15% of Materials companies. Despite Weyerhaeuser’s consistent record of paltry returns and ineffective capital allocation, the market’s valuation implies high expectations for future growth and profitability. In order to justify its current stock price, Weyerhaeuser needs compounded annual revenue growth of over 15% for the next 20 years, a daunting task for a Materials company. When you combine a sky-high valuation, consistently unimpressive returns, and Weyerhaeuser’s nearly $4.5 billion in debt and $1.5 billion in underfunded pensions, you get a high-risk/low-reward stock. 168 stocks of the 3000+ I cover are classified as Materials stocks, but due to style drift, Materials ETFs and mutual funds hold 232 stocks. Figures 4 and 5 show the rating landscape of all Materials ETFs and mutual funds. Our sector roadmap report ranks all sectors and highlights those that offer the best investments.

2012-09-21,Hard Asset Boom Could Lift These ETFs,"Financial markets do enjoy news of quantitative easing. U.S. equities proved as much last Thursday when the Federal Reserve unveiled the latest version in what is now a trilogy of monetary stimulus. Part of the rub with QE in any form is that it is good for lifting near-term sentiment, but too much easing can have dour long-term consequences. First and foremost is the potential for increased inflation. Inflation is not good because it diminishes the purchasing power of the dollar. That could mean a dollar will not buy the same amount of coffee, gold, oil, platinum, silver, etc. in five or ten years as it does today. It is an obvious trade. Hard assets rise in price, leading investors to covet the shares of quality hard asset producers. There is no dearth of materials ETFs on the market today with which to play this trend, but there are some not-so-obvious candidates that merit consideration. FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index ETF (NYSE: GUNR) The FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index ETF debuted a year ago and with almost $515 million in assets under management, it is fair to say this is one of the most successful ETFs that launched last year. Calling GUNR obscure, is clearly inaccurate and unfair, but it is fair to say the fund does not receive the same notoriety as other materials-focused ETFs. Popularity aside, GUNR merits consideration as an ETF that will benefit from rising hard asset prices. The ETF is a plethora of materials and natural resources equities. Agri-business and integrated oil names combine for half of the fund's weight, but the ETF also features a 16.7 weight to diversified mining firms and an 8.7 percent allocation to gold miners. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), the largest U.S. oil company, is GUNR's largest individual holding with a weight of almost 5.4 percent. GUNR is up 10.1 percent this year, easily outpacing the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) in the process. Market Vectors RVE Hard Assets Producers ETF (NYSE: HAP) As is the case with GUNR, the Market Vectors RVE Hard Assets Producers ETF is home to a robust AUM total ($146.2 million), but HAP is also an example of a hard assets fund that does not draw much acclaim. HAP and GUNR are similar in that both offer broad-based exposure to multiple materials and natural resources sub-sectors. For those investors that think the 120 stocks held by GUNR is not enough, HAP holds nearly triple that amount. However, HAP is not diverse as GUNR as the former allocates a combined 82 percent of its weight to energy and materials names. Top-10 holdings include Exxon, Monsanto (NYSE: MON), Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (NYSE: POT) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP), so there is some duplication with GUNR. HAP is also slightly more expensive with fees of 0.49 percent compared to 0.48 percent for GUNR. First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ) The First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund is proof positive that index methodology can make a difference in an ETF's return. On the surface, FXZ would appear to be an also ran next to the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW), just to name a pair. For starters, FXZ is not tiny with almost $176 million in assets under management. There are some moving parts to this ETF's index methodology, but to describe it simple terms, the bottom 25 percent of the Russell 1000 Materials and Processing Index are eliminated. The selected stocks are divided into quintiles based on their rankings and the top ranked quintiles receive a higher weight within the index. The stocks are equally-weighted within each quintile, according to First Trust. That means FXZ features some of the same constituents as XLB and VAW, but with vastly different weights. Asking why First Trust uses this is methodology is not important. Asking about the result is. Year-to-date, in the past year and over the past five years, XLB and VAW come nowhere FXZ in terms of generating alpha. For more on ETFs, click here."
2012-11-15,"Soros Adds to Gold Miner ETF Positions, Raises GLD Stake","Billionaire investor George Soros, who as recently as late 2011 said gold was an asset bubble, now appears quite bullish on the yellow metal and the companies that extract it from the earth. During the third quarter, Soros Fund Management LLC added to its investment in the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the second-largest ETF in the world by assets. The firm raised its interest in GLD to 1.3 million shares from 884,400 shares, according to an SEC filing. Even at 1.3 million shares. Soros Fund Management owns a small percentage of GLD's shares outstanding, which stood at 443.2 million as of November 14. The filing also indicates Soros Fund Management has boosted its holdings of ETFs that own shares of gold miners. An August SEC filing showed the firm held 1 million shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and nearly 2.4 million shares of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). The November filing indicates Soros has more than doubled his GDX stake to 2.32 million shares and now holds a sizable chunk of call options on the ETF as well. The firm's position in GDXJ has not changed, according to the filing. Since mid-August, GLD has jumped 6.6 percent while GDXJ has soared 5.7 percent. GDX has risen 3.3 percent over the same time. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) combine for a third of GDX's weight. Soros also slightly added to his position in the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). The firm owned 350,000 shares of XME as of the August filing, but the more recent November filing indicates that stake has risen to 353,400 shares and the firm also owns call options on that ETF. XME does hold some gold miners, but the fund is heavily allocated to coal and steel names such as Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE). Soros also holds a stake in the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) as well as call options on that position. Other ETFs that Soros Fund Management holds interests in according to the November filing include the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP), the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE: KBE) and the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). The firm also owns options on the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM) and the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI). EEM is the second-largest emerging markets ETF by assets while FXI is the largest China fund. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-01-03,An Unheralded Sector ETF For China Exposure,"China, the world's second-largest economy, delivered another positive economic data point overnight as the country's official purchasing managers' index for the services sector soared to 56.1 in December from 55.6 in November. A surge in construction services to 61.9 from 61.3 in November lead the way, bolstering proof that China's economy is in fact turning around. Predictably, the turnaround in China's economy and its equities has lifted the fortunes of an array of China-specific and other emerging markets ETFs. However, investors looking to play a China rally with sector ETFs have some compelling options as well. The still new iShares MSCI Global Select Metals & Mining Producers Fund (NYSE: PICK) comes to mind. PICK will celebrate its first birthday at the end of this month and over that time, the ETF has been a prodigious gather of assets, raking in $263.5 million in assets under management. That is an impressive tally for less than a year of work. Importantly, several of PICK's 285 holdings are intimately levered to a rebounding Chinese economy, as Street One Financial Vice President Paul Weisbruch highlights in a research note out today. With China based equities finally springing to life after a period of prolonged under-performance and noting that China is the largest single country component of the broad based MSCI Emerging Markets Index (19.01% weighting currently), PICK is well positioned to benefit from any demand for metals used in the construction/infrastructure build out process that is often linked to China and other emerging economies, said Weisbruch. BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP), the world's largest mining company, alone represents almost 20 percent of PICK's weight. Rivals Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) and Vale (NYSE: VALE) are also found among PICK's top-10 holdings along with U.S. copper giant Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX). Weisbruch also notes that since PICK debuted in last January, the fund has outperformed the more established SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). XME has over $1 billion in AUM, but over the past six months, PICK is up 15.3 percent compared to a gain of 7.8 percent for XME. Over the same time horizon, PICK has sharply outperformed Rio Tinto, Vale and Freeport. And although PICK is a sector fund, it does give investors plenty of emerging markets exposure at the country level. Brazil, South Korea, South Africa and Mexico are top-10 country weights. The fund also offers modest exposure to Taiwan, Russia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Chile and Turkey among others. Investors get all that with PICK for an annual expense ratio of 0.39 percent, which compares favorably with several popular, materials-heavy emerging markets ETFs. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-01-04,S&P Lukewarm on Some Materials ETFs,"Despite signs of slowing growth in some emerging markets, there are also signs the U.S. economy is rebounding and China has delivered plenty of signals in recent weeks that is experiencing a turnaround of its own. That could be just one of the catalysts to lift materials ETFs in 2013, though S&P Capital IQ has a Neutral view of the sector. We foresee monthly PMI data for each of the major economies, including China, continuing to show improvement as the year progresses. In addition, EPS growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 for this S&P 500 sector is expected by Capital IQ consensus estimates to be 3.9% and exceed that for the S&P 500. In 2013, earnings are expected to be similarly strong. Finally, our technical outlook has been raised to neutral with a bullish bias, from neutral with a bearish bias, S&P Capital IQ said in a recent research note. The research firm is somewhat bullish on diversified chemicals firms, which could favor an ETF such as the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYM). Fundamentals for diversified chemicals, the largest sub-industry in the sector, are positive, according the S&P Capital IQ equity analysts. We think the decline in U.S. natural gas prices relative to global crude oil prices has improved the feedstock cost competitiveness of the U.S. petrochemical industry versus other global regions, such as Europe, thus helping boost U.S. industry exports, said S&P Capital IQ. IYM, which is home $543.4 million in assets under management, features Dow component DuPont (NYSE: DD), Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW), Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE: APD) and other chemicals names among its top-10 lineup. S&P rates IYM as Marketweight. The ETF has an annual expense ratio of 0.47 percent. S&P Capital IQ also has a Market-weight rating on the Vanguard Chemicals ETF (NYSE: VAW). Due to a recent fee reduction announced by Vanguard, VAW now has the lowest expense ratio of any materials ETF at 0.14 percent per year. VAW allocates 19.3 percent of its weight to diversified chemicals names, though its largest holding is crop nutrients maker Monsanto (NYSE: MON). S&P is also bullish on diversified metals and mining names. The firm said its equity analysts have a positive fundamental outlook for the next 12 months, as we believe sales and earnings will recover from 2012's depressed levels. Our expectation reflects our view that prices for aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, iron ore and coking coal will rebound from 2012's levels on higher demand and less rapidly rising output. The research firm has a Market-weight rating on the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). That $2.55 billion ETF is includes mining names such as Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) along with Monsanto and DuPoint among its top holdings. S&P is less enthused about the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), which it rates Underweight. With steel stocks such as U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) accounting for over 36 percent of XME's weight, the ETF carries a high beta of 1.67 and is highly dependent on a strong economies in the developed and emerging worlds to drive its returns. Investors should also note XME has an almost 15 percent to beaten down coal and consumable fuels names. For more on materials ETFs, click here."

2013-04-01,Materials Mess: These ETFs Are in Trouble,"These are not the best of times for materials stocks and the corresponding ETFs. In the first quarter, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) gained 4.8 percent. While that does not sound terrible, it is less than half the 10.5 percent returned by the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). XLB's performance also makes it the worst of the nine sector SPDRs. In fact, seven of the nine sector SPDRs offered double-digit first-quarter returns with only the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) joining XLB in the single-digit club. Still, XLK's 5.4 percent first-quarter gain is far better than XLB's performance. Unfortunately for materials bulls, XLB looks like one of the better ETFs tracking this sector. Year-to-date, Monsanto (NYSE: MON) an DuPont (NYSE: DD) are up 9.86 percent and 7.17 percent, respectively. Those stocks combine for over 21 percent of XLB's weight. XLB has also been helped by the fact metals miners account for just 17 percent of the ETF's weight. Other materials ETFs have not been so fortunate and several now look imperiled. Take the case of the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). The $609.3 million XME plunged 10.3 percent in the first quarter and that was before Monday's two percent loss (as of 1:30 PM Eastern time). XME has an ominous sub-sector mix. Alone, gold miners account for 10.4 percent of the fund's weight and as if that is not bad enough, other metals miners account for another 11.6 percent while coal and consumable fuels names represent 17.3 percent, according to State Street data. Making matters worse is the fact that last week XME made a death cross, the technical scenario where a shorter term moving average crosses below a longer term average. In the case of XME, its 50-day moving average is now slightly below its 200-day line. Speaking of coal stocks, 2013 is proving to be another tough year for that group. Add in Monday's almost 1.6 percent slide and the Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL) is now off 10.2 percent year-to-date. KOL has not made a death cross yet, but the chart indicates it may just be a matter of time. In another bad sign for KOL, at least four of its top-10 holdings – Joy Global (NYSE: JOY), Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU), Yanzhou Coal (NYSE: YZC) and Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT) – reside below their 200-day moving averages. Those stocks combine for over 21 percent of KOL's weight. If KOL violates support at $22.50, a return to $20 seems likely. Things are not much better for global materials names. The iShares S&P Global Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: MXI) is now down 5.7 percent this year when accounting for Monday's 0.9 percent loss. A 44 percent weight to metals miners has proven problematic and MXI is now struggling to hold support at its 200-day line. Additionally, MXI allocates 14.5 percent of its weight to various securities issued by BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO). Australian central bankers and policymakers have already acknowledged mining investment there is declining and that the mining boom will peak later this year, implying upside could be limited for these stocks and related fare. Another cause for concern: More than a third of MXI's top-18 holdings have exposure to gold mining. That is not a good thing when the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down 18.4 percent this year. A possible solution for investors looking to profit the woes of the materials sector is the ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN). SMN seeks to deliver twice the daily inverse performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index. That is the index tracked by the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYM). If IYM breaks resistance at $52, a run to $55 could be in the offing.

2013-04-02,Further Confirmation Materials ETFs Are Imperiled,"With the S&P 500 up about 0.7 percent Tuesday and having touched a new record high, it is not hard to find the laggards among sector ETFs. There are a few funds tracking the oil and semiconductor sub-segments that are in the red, but those losses are not yet alarming. The real cause for concern remains the materials sector. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is down 0.54 percent today, and while that may not sound like much, remember that XLB was by far the worst performer of the nine sector SPDRs in the first quarter. XLB's first-quarter gain was not even half of what the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) returned. Tuesday may be just one day, but the problem for XLB and other materials ETFs is that this far from the worst day this year these funds have been laggards. As lower beta sectors such as consumer staples and health care have lead the broader market higher, materials names have under-performed perhaps foreshadowing imminent declines. XLB is not the only materials ETF offender, either. As Benzinga noted on Monday, the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) is in serious technical trouble. That ETF is off another 1.5 percent today and has now lost more than 16.5 percent year-to-date. With gold futures being hammered, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are both off more than three percent. In further proof that traders hate gold mining stocks and reverse splits are a joke, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bull Shares (NYSE: NUGT) is down nearly 11 percent today, the ETF's first trading day after undergoing a four-for-one reverse split. There is more bad news. The iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials Index Fund (NYSE: IYM) is flirting with support in the $68.80 area. A break there probably takes the ETF back to $65-$66. If the Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW) cannot hold $87, it likely returns to $82. Another way of illustrating the dark clouds hanging over materials ETFs right now is this. Look at a heat map of inverse ETFs and exclude the ones that are trading on a post-split basis today. The noteworthy, legitimate gainer is the ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN), which is close to staging a breakout of its own. SMN is not the largest nor is it the most heavily traded inverse ETF out there. However, it is up nearly one percent on a day when the S&P 500 hit a new record high and that is not a good sign for long materials ETFs. For more on materials ETFs, click here."

The Dow lost 0.26 percent, but was able to hold above the 17,000 level. The high beta stocks underperformed with the NASDAQ losing 0.77 percent as money flowed into the “boring” sectors of the market. The market is set to open lower again today and more light volume selling could be the theme this week. iShares Dow Jones Transportation Index ETF (NYSE: IYT) The sector lagged the overall market yesterday with a loss of 1.05 percent, led lower by the airline stocks. The selling yesterday is no reason to panic as the ETF closed at a new all-time high to end last week even though the airlines stocks have struggled the last couple of weeks. The airlines make up 15 percent of the ETF with the railroads the sector with the highest weighting at 24 percent. The airlines are looking to open lower again this morning and investors can expect IYT to be on the defensive in early trading. SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) After the bell today Alcoa (NYSE: AA) unofficially kicks off earnings season when it reports its numbers for the second quarter. Analysts expect earnings to increase by 42 percent over last year, but revenue to decline by 3 percent. The stock is up over 40 percent in 2014 and may need a good number to keep the momentum going. AA is not a top ten holding in XME, however if the stock is moving it could have an affect on other metals companies that will move the ETF. Alerian MLP ETF (NYSE: AMLP) The entire group of master limited partnerships (MLPs) have gotten hit the last few days after the jobs number was reported. The theory is that as the economy improves as evidenced by the jobs report, the Fed could raise interest rates sooner rather than later. This would put pressure on investments that already pay high dividends. With risk-free interest rates on the rise it makes MLPs less attractive. As of now it looks like it will be at least another year until the Fed makes any moves and therefore the pullback in AMLP and its peers may be short-term."

2014-11-28,Drop In Iron Ore Hitting Mining ETFs,"Iron ore continued its decline this week by dipping below $70/dry metric ton, a price it has not seen since 2009. The decline in price is due to an increase in supply from Australia and Brazil, the two largest global exporters, and weakening demand from China, the world largest consumer of the commodity. This latest move has the price heading for a 13-percent loss so far in November. Chinese iron ore demand has slowed simply due to the slowing of their overall economy. The cutting of interest rates by China’s Central Bank last week for the first time since 2012 paints a bleak picture for China’s economy in the short-term. The price of iron ore will likely continue to decline until a robust pickup is seen in the Chinese economy. Highlighted below are two ETFs that have been affected by the decline in iron prices and are attempting to find a bottom. The Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) follows 28 publicly traded companies involved in the production of steel products or mining and processing of iron ore. The ETF is distributed across nine countries with the United States at 38 percent and Brazil at 21 percent being the most heavily weighted countries.

The falling price of Iron ore has had a direct impact on the performance of the ETF. Year to date the ETF is down 17 percent and 13 percent over the last six months. Last week the steel ETF hit its lowest point in 16 months. The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.55 percent. The SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) consists of 41 U.S. publicly traded companies that are involved in the metals and mining sector. The ETF is distributed across seven sub-sectors with steel at 41 percent, coal and consumable fuels at 18 percent, and diversified metals and fuel at 16 percent. The top holdings include Consol Energy Inc (NYSE: CNX) making up 3.8 percent of the ETF, Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA) with a 3.7 percent holding, and Compass Minerals International Inc (NYSE: CMP) coming in at 3.6 percent. XME is down 16 percent year to date and 12 percent over the last six months. The metals and mining ETF has an expense ratio of 0.35 percent. It appears Chinese iron ore demand is finally slowing after helping producers around the world generate record profits since the early 2000s. Due to the massive oversupply that is currently available it is hard to predict where iron ore will find a bottom. One would have to assume that it will stabilize at some point in the future, thus providing a favorable opportunity for investors that are willing to wait for a bottom to form."

2015-01-13,Credit Suisse Picks Gems In Mining Sector,"Trying to eke out gains from mining stocks in 2015 could prove a tough task for investors, a group of analysts said Tuesday. After four years of below average returns, the sector continues to face slowing demand, oversupply and narrowing margins, according to a group of analysts at Credit Suisse. The SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) is off nearly 29 percent in the past 12 months and the sector's general outlook remains cloudy at best. In picking through the sector, Credit Suisse prefers companies with strong balance sheets and cash flows, and exposure to precious and base metals over iron and other bulk commodities. Among base metals, the group likes exposure to zinc and nickel more than copper and aluminum, and recommends both MMC Norilsk Nickel with its relatively strong free cash flow and dividend yield, and Boliden AB (OTC: BDNNF) citing its outlook for strong growth in earnings and cash flow. For diamond lovers, Credit Suisse suggests a look at Russian producer Alrosa (MCX: ALRS), with its strengthening cash flow and dividends, plus an expected 3 percent annual gain in price for the gemstones. Aquarius Platinum's (OTC: AQPTY) cash flow and growth potential, plus its relatively low valuation may make it attractive to those favoring the company's namesake metal, the analysts said. With regard to gold miners, Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. (NYSE: AEM) is likely to offer improved 2015 guidance and Credit Suisse analysts said a recent selloff in the company's shares is overdone. On iron ore, the analysts are structurally bearish, while turning to coal, lower demand from China could sustain the current market surplus, the analysts said. Among coal miners, the analysts like Adaro Energy (OTC: ADOOY) as a low-cost producer that expects to increase the volume of its production."

Mr. Market seems to believe as much as the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) has shed 43.2 percent this year. XME's woes are easily explained. The ETF allocates nearly 48 percent of its weight to steel stocks and as if that is not bad enough, the fund devotes a combined 17.6 percent of its weight to coal and gold miners. Again, it might be crazy to get involved with an ETF like XME even at that 43 percent tumble, but some traders apparently see upside in the moribund fund as evidence by some unusual upside call buying in the fund last week. On Thursday “we saw action in infrequently traded XME (SPDR S&P Metals & Mining, Expense Ratio 0.35%) options, consisting of January 20 calls trading more than 20,000 times.

For one day at least, XME bulls looked smart as the ETF surged 4.6 percent last Friday, a day after that unusual call buying was spotted. As contrarian trade, XME merits consideration by the trader that believes in the mantra of be greedy when others are fearful. If old investing maxims are not one's cup of tea, one should consider the fact that relative to its recent track record, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF is starting to look pretty good. The largest gold miners ETF jumped more than eight percent last Friday and now resides above its 20- and 50-day moving averages. Improvements in GDX are important to XME because was noted earlier, the latter devotes 10.3 percent of its weight to gold miners. Additionally, silver and other precious metals miners combine for almost another 13 percent of XME's lineup and four precious metals miners are found among XME's top 10 holdings. Following Friday's close at $17.33, XME would need to gain 15.4 percent by January options expiry to bring the aforementioned calls to a point where profitability can be discussed. Given XME's penchant for volatility, it is possible these options could be winners. The S&P Metals and Mining Select Industry Index, XME's underlying index, has a five-year standard deviation of 35.45 percent compared to 15.15 percent for the S&P 1500, according to Standard & Poor's data."

2015-10-19,This Mining ETF Is Trying To Mount A Comeback,"Shares of non-precious metals miners have continued slumping this year as highlighted by the performances of exchange-traded funds dedicated to coal producers and steelmakers. However, the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME) has recently been perking up, rising more than 2 percent over the past month. That might not sound like much, but consider this: The $259 million XME is down 40.5 percent this year and more than 47 percent over the past year. XME Headwinds Slack global economic growth forecasts and flooding of the market with cheap steel by foreign producers are among the headwinds XME and its 30 holdings have had to deal with in recent years. Slumping steelmakers are a significant problem for XME, as the ETF devotes 48 percent of its weight to that group. That makes steel producers XME's larges industry weight at nearly quadruple the weight assigned to diversified miners, the ETF's second-largest sector exposure. Related Link: Bullish Leveraged Gold Miners ETFs Are On Fire “An appreciating U.S. dollar, excess global capacity due to weaker demand in China and the influx of cheap imports has negatively impacted U.S. domestic steel producers’ market share and margins due to the extreme price competition,” said S&P Capital IQ in a note out Monday. “However, S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Matthew Miller believes the worst is over for steel producers and we see upcoming catalysts from pending trade case determinations. He thinks that imports will revert back down to historical levels, allowing steel producers to benefit from a gradually improving construction market, impressive automobile demand, and an aerospace industry poised to experience a long-term secular uptrend.” XME Allocations XME features four steelmakers among its top 10 holdings, including Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), which accounts for 4.4 percent of the ETF's weight. S&P Capital IQ has a Strong Buy rating on Nucor, the largest U.S. steelmaker. “According to Miller, NUE's strategy to become more vertically integrated with its new Louisiana direct reduced iron plant will result in generally less volatile production costs. The new plant will enhance NUE's low-cost position in the U.S. steel industry. “For the longer term, he sees earnings rising on U.S. economic growth, strong automotive demand, and a recovery in U.S. nonresidential steel demand and better control of raw material costs. In 2016, S&P Capital IQ forecasts $3.18 in 2016, up from $1.67 in 2015, driven in part by 8 percent revenue growth,” said the research firm. XME's Catalysts XME has also recently been boosted by the resurgence of precious metals miners, as the ETF allocates a combined 23.2 percent of its weight to precious metals miners. Up nearly 13 percent over the past month, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is among the leaders of the precious metal miners ETF comeback. “GDX has $5 billion in assets and it trades on average 63 million shares on a daily basis with a $0.01 bid/ask spread,” said S&P Capital IQ. GDX is top heavy, as its top 10 holdings combine for over half the ETF's weight. Image Credit: Public Domain"
2015-12-03,Traders See Pain Train Arriving For The Steel ETF,"Few non-leveraged sector and industry exchange-traded funds can rival the weakness exhibited by the Market Vectors Steel (ETF) (NYSE: SLX) this year. The steel ETF is down nearly 38 percent. In the essence of fairness, it should also be noted that the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME), which allocates a significant chunk of its weight to steel stocks, has been much worse than SLX with a 2015 loss of 47.5 percent. With those data points in mind, it might seem like a death wish for a trading account to become involved with a metals and mining ETF of any type, let alone one that is heavy on gold miners, coal miners and steel producers; XME allocates nearly half its weight to steel stocks and such stocks comprise half of the fund's top 10 holdings. Related Link: Alibaba Investment Arm Will Enter The Steel Trading Business More Downside Ahead? Despite an average year-to-date decline of nearly 43 percent for XME and SLX, short sellers are being relentless in their attacks on steel equities, indicating these ETFs and their components could be in for more near-term downside. “The tough operating conditions have seen short sellers circle around steelmakers, with global steelmaking firms tracked by Markit’s short interest data seeing a 50 percent increase in the demand to borrow their shares since the start of the year. The increase takes the demand to borrow to past the 3 percent of shares outstanding mark, something which the sector hasn’t seen since the start of 2013,” according to Markit. Markit data reveal that average number of shares of global steelmakers out on loan to short sellers is up 50 percent to 3 percent from 2 percent two years ago. Short interest in ex-U.S. steelmakers is relevant when discussing SLX because that ETF allocates just 40 percent of its weight to U.S. companies. Just three of the ETF's top 10 holdings are American companies. Making matters worse for SLX is a more than 18 percent weight to Brazilian companies, including a nearly 11 percent allocation to that country's iron ore giant Vale SA (ADR) (NYSE: VALE). Vale's New York-listed shares are down 56.7 percent year-to-date and residing slightly over $3; a reverse split cannot be ruled out. Related Link: Steel Price To Recover In 2016, Major Bank Predicts Still, data suggest short sellers are particularly fond of North American steelmakers and iron ore producers. “North American firms, which have had to contend with the recent rising dollar, are top on the short seller’s shopping list as American firms make up the four global steel firms with more than 20 percent of their shares out on loan,” added Markit. Nearly all of the 30 stocks found in the $241.8 million XME are North American companies. Image Credit: Public Domain"

The latest U.S. economic numbers make the case for an imminent Fed rate hike even stronger. The question on all traders’ minds is how to play rising interest rates. Although conventional belief is that financials are the major beneficiaries of higher rates, Credit Suisse recently discussed another approach to trading a Fed rate hike. The Idea According to a new Credit Suisse report, the first Fed rate hike will likely put an end to the U.S. dollar rally. Historically, the dollar has performed weakly after the beginning of the past five rate hike cycles. The Impact As a result, commodity prices will likely find some much-needed support following the first U.S. rate hike. “In the following 1/3/6 months we tend to see the Commod sectors (particularly the Miners) outperform [...] as one would expect with a weaker USD and the positive translation to Commod pricing,” Credit Suisse explained. Related Link: How Have Bank Stocks Traded During The Last Three Fed Tightening Cycles? Why Not Banks? In theory, rising rates should provide a boost banks' bottom lines. A large part of banks’ profits comes from the spread between the interest they collect from long-term loans and the interest they pay on short-term debt. While a rise in interest rates across the board doesn’t necessarily improve this spread, it theoretically gives banks more wiggle room when it comes to their net interest margins (NIM), which have been declining steadily in recent years. However, history shows that bank stocks have not performed particularly well during tightening cycles. A Better Alternative? According to Credit Suisse, instead of buying banks, traders should be looking for battered mining stocks to play the rate hike. The SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME) is down 50.0 percent in 2015. Top holdings AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA) and Carpenter Technology Corporation (NYSE: CRS) are all down more than 35.0 percent this year.

2016-01-26,Bruni On Approaching Tactical Bounces In Bear Markets,"Approaching Tactical Bounces In Bear Markets During market corrections, correlations tend to go to one across asset classes, but more specifically global equity markets tend to move together. Throughout the global equity markets and U.S. sectors I follow, many tactical downside targets were met with momentum diverging positively, suggesting a relief-rally may occur over the next few weeks. Many of these markets followed up their mid-week reversals with follow through to end the week, which adds to the case for additional upside over the short-term. It’s important to realize though that most of these moves are occurring within the context of structural downtrends / bear markets, which means this bounce is just that for the time being. Significantly more time will be needed to repair the long-term structural damage these markets have experienced. How you approach this type of scenario will depend on your plan as a market participant, but for me it really boils down to two main scenarios. Either you can choose to take tactical long positions to capitalize on these bounces, or you can simply wait for them to play out and re-enter on the short side at higher levels. Some people will do both, others may do something different altogether. If you’re looking to participate in these counter-trend rallies, how do you figure out what’s the best way to express the theme of counter-trend rallies occurring throughout the global equity markets when almost everything seems to participate in one capacity or another? I’m sure there are a million schools of thought on this, but for me, I like to look for stocks / sectors / markets where the risk is well defined and the weight of evidence suggests that the probability of a bounce is high, relative to the other setups out there. I find that this occurs most often in names that have found support at levels where both structural and tactical downside targets were hit, with momentum diverging on multiple time frames. This means often passing on the more beaten down sectors where mean reversion could occur in rip-your-face-off fashion, in favor of a trade where the weight of evidence suggests there is a higher probability of success, but less potential reward. Some may be comfortable taking the lower probability trade in exchange for a higher potential reward, but I tend to lean toward what I view as higher probability trades. To illustrate exactly what I’m talking about, I’ll outline an example of each from the current market environment. I’ll also list a few other names I’m watching / doing more work on toward the end of the post, but won’t post the charts of them here for the sake of space. The daily chart shows the failed breakdown below the August lows, which also corresponds with the long-term support discussed on the weekly chart. Momentum diverged at the recent lows with prices breaking back above the prior lows to confirm the failed breakdown and momentum divergence. This provides a level to trade against where the risk is well-defined, while the rest of the evidence suggests mean reversion may be underway in this market. In the case of Taiwan, there is strong evidence across multiple time-frames that suggests a counter-trend mean reversion is taking place and that the risk is well-defined. Prices are 22% below the 200 day moving average, and though prices won’t get there in a straight line, a calculated entry can provide a great risk/reward opportunity on the long side. Lower Probability But Higher Potential Reward: S&P Metals & Mining (XME) The S&P Metals & Mining ETF has been in a structural downtrend for the past 5 years or so, and just this past week reached another structural downside target at the 261.8% Fibonacci extension of the 2013-2014 rally. This occurred while momentum diverged and prices were extended from their accelerated trend lines. These developments may suggest that some mean reversion could start from current levels, but it must also be recognized that this comes within the context of prices being just off their all-time lows. The daily chart shows the failed breakdown that occurred late last week with momentum diverging. This combined with the developments on the weekly chart provide a clear level to trade against. Prices are 67% below their 200 day moving average and this sector is heavily shorted, so a short squeeze could occur in the coming weeks if this failed breakdown holds. Although the potential reward is higher, it comes within the context of having less evidence / a lower probability than a setup like the one I discussed in Taiwan (EWT). In the case of the S&P Metals & Mining sector, there is some evidence across multiple time frames to suggest a counter-trend mean reversion may be in its early stages. The risk is well-defined, but there is less total evidence than a scenario like Taiwan, simply because we are at a level that hasn’t been tested as extensively as the support levels in EWT have (or at all for that matter). With that being said, the lower probability nature of this setup is compensated by a potentially higher reward. Other markets that are exhibiting similar characteristics to Taiwan in varying degrees are: Micro-caps (IWC), S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP), Airlines (XAL), Broker Dealers (IAI), Emerging Markets (EEM), Hong Kong (EWH), China Large-Cap (FXI), Russia (RSX), Chile (ECH), South Africa (EZA), and Netherlands (EWN). The Bottom Line: There’s no right or wrong way to approach bounces during bear markets, but it is important to have a plan with which you approach trading counter-trend rallies when they do occur. When these types of market conditions are present, this approach is generally how I help narrow down my thoughts on which areas of the market I’d like to focus my efforts and capital. It should also be noted that this represents the middle phase of my Top-Down Approach, and that the information I gather from this type of analysis may be expressed in a way that’s different than simply trading the underlying asset class outright. That’s a conversation for another day / post though. As always, if you have any questions feel free to reach out and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can. @Brunicharting"

2016-11-30,Materials Mavens: Sector ETFs To Embrace,"Underscoring this year's renaissance in cyclical sectors, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is up more than 15 percent, a showing that is good for third among the sector SPDR exchange-traded funds. The two SPDRs outpacing XLB this year are cyclical funds, those tracking the energy and industrial sectors. Commodities And Materials Commodities are seen as sensitive to U.S. interest rates, but the materials sector is not as inversely correlated to rates as, say, telecom or utilities. As a cyclical sector, materials can actually perform well if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates because that would be a sign the Fed is confident the economy is strong enough to endure higher borrowing costs. Some analysts are increasingly bullish on the materials sector. “CFRA’s Investment Policy Committee raised its weighting on the materials sector to Overweight from Marketweight last week. Sam Stovall, CFRA’s Chief Investment Strategist, noted that we project this mid-to-late economic cycle outperformer to record above-market EPS growth in 2017, assisted by a recovery in commodity prices from their drawn-out decline. He also thinks the group will benefit from the expected pickup in U.S. infrastructure spending under the new Republican administration,” said CFRA Research in a note out Tuesday. XLB is home to $3.57 billion in assets under management, making it the largest materials ETF on the market. The fund holds 28 stocks, but its lineup is top heavy as Dow component E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: DD), Dow Chemical Co (NYSE: DOW) and agribusiness giant Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) combine for nearly 31 percent of the ETF's weight. Chemicals Sub-Industry Chemicals makers represent over 71 percent of XLB's weight, which could be a positive going forward. “Christopher Muir, a CFRA equity analyst, has a positive fundamental outlook for the diversified chemicals sub-industry, the largest in the S&P 500 materials sector. Muir believes that the business environment for the chemical industry will remain healthy and that the chemical manufacturing sector will continue to expand. Equity analyst Matt Miller raised his fundamental outlook to positive on the steel industry in November in part due to Trump’s discussion in the campaign to significantly increasing tariffs on imported steel from China,” said CFRA. The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME), which has more than doubled in value this year, allocates over 58 percent of its weight to steel stocks. Previously high-flying precious metals miners are 15 percent of XME's lineup. CFRA has a Market-Weight rating on XME and an Overweight rating on XLB."
2016-12-13,3 Ways To Trade The Fed Rate Decision,"The Federal Reserve begins its December meeting on Tuesday, and the market widely expects the first U.S. interest rate hike since December of last year. A recent Wall Street Journal poll revealed economists expect four 0.25 percent rate hikes by the Fed between now and the end of 2017. Given the likelihood of steadily-rising interest rates, investors are now shifting their attention which investments are best-positioned for the imminent tightening. Here are three ETFs to consider. SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME) Historically, commodity prices have outperformed in the first six months of a rate-tightening cycle. Most commodities have performed relatively well in 2016 already. Higher commodity prices would be a shot in the arm for miners and the XME ETF. Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLF) Now that the XLF no longer holds REITs, it's a much better option for a rising rates cycle. Banks and insurance companies benefit from higher interest rates because they allow for higher margins. However, there is an inverse correlation between interest rates and REIT performance, so any financial ETF that holds REITs will likely not perform as well. Sit Rising Rate ETF (NYSE: RISE) For investors that really expect interest rates to take off, the RISE ETF is specifically designed to move on rising rates. The RISE shorts futures contracts on two- five- and 10-year Treasury bonds. The ETF is structured to produce a 10X levered return on interest rates. If economists are correct and rates rise by 1.0 percent in the next year, the RISE ETF would theoretically generate a +10 percent return, minus fees and tracking errors."
2017-09-28,Some Mining ETFs Are On Shaky Ground,"The materials sector is one of the smallest sector weights in the S&P 500, but that status is not preventing the group from turning in a solid showing in 2017. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA: XLB), the largest materials exchange traded fund by assets, is up more than 13 percent year-to-date. Drilling down into the broader materials sector, some analysts see weakness afoot for metals and mining equities. Broadly speaking, ETFs tracking such stocks have been laggards this year, as highlighted by a mere 5.3 percent year-to-date gain for the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSEARCA: XME). XME provides equal-weight exposure to miners of gold and silver as well industrial metals miners and producers, meaning the ETF is also exposed to demand trends for the likes of aluminum and copper, among other metals. Of Course It's About China As the world's largest commodities consumer, China remains a key driver of price action in ETFs like XME. That may be alright for now, but some analysts believe that theme could be a problem in the not-too-distant future. “With few exceptions, we continue to see mined commodity and miner share prices as overvalued, propped up by Chinese stimulus,” said Morningstar in a recent research note. “Iron ore's relative buoyancy since early 2016 is emblematic of most industrial commodities.” There are signs that China's ability to prop up demand for industrial metals could be weakening, which could signal downside for ETFs such as XME. “We do not expect this to last,” said Morningstar. “With China's credit growth slowing, we continue to expect mined commodity prices in general, and particularly iron ore, to fall materially and for share prices to follow. Miners we cover are generally substantially overvalued, and few trade in line with our fair value estimates.” More About XME XME holds just 29 stocks, about 18 percent of which are gold and silver miners. While precious metals miners are typically responsive to price trends in those underlying metals, XME's exposure to gold and silver is not enough to obfuscate its potential vulnerability to industrial metals weakness. Alone, steel stocks are 47.5 percent of XME's weight, exposing the ETF to metallurgical coal and iron ore demand trends. Aluminum equities account for 11.3 percent of the ETF's roster. “We forecast a significant deceleration in aluminum demand growth and anticipate that the impact of capacity cuts will prove far overstated,” according to Morningstar. “Accordingly, we forecast a long-term aluminum price of only $1,475 per metric ton (in real terms), nearly 30 percent below current levels.” Related Links: Beautiful Bank ETFs.

2017-10-27,What Donald Trump's Shortlist For The Fed Chair Might Mean For Rates,"President Donald Trump has reportedly narrowed his decision for Federal Reserve chair down to three people: current chair Janet Yellen, Stanford University economist John Taylor or former investment banker Jay Powell. The Washington Post reported three Washington insiders have said Powell and Taylor are the two outside finalists for the position. Fed policy is a critical part of the investment equation, so understanding what (if anything) could change in the Fed’s direction in 2018 is extremely important. Yellen Still In The Mix In the past, Yellen seemed extremely unlikely to remain in her position. During the 2016 campaign season, Trump said Yellen should be “ashamed of herself” for Fed policy during her regime. However, Trump is prone to changing his mind and seemed to have softened his stance on Yellen in an April 2017 interview with the Wall Street Journal. You know, I like her … I do like the low-interest rate policy, Trump said. Related Link: Trump Said If Rates Go Up, It Won't Be Pretty; Market Still At All-Time Highs Obviously the least disruptive decision Trump could make for investors would be to leave Yellen in place to continue her approach of cautiously and slowly raising interest rates. The 2 Challengers If Trump chooses to go in a different direction, Powell would likely make for a smoother transition. In the past, Powell has shared Yellen’s attitude of erring on the side of caution when it comes to monetary policy. “Markets should take a Powell announcement largely in stride, keeping financial conditions easy and providing little disruption to an economy that is experiencing solid growth,” Deutsche Bank wrote Monday. Taylor, on the other hand, is generally considered to be more hawkish on policy and could advocate for a faster, more aggressive rate hike schedule. Bloomberg’s Michael McKee tweeted on Friday that Powell is the favorite in the race. However, if Trump decides to go with Taylor, stocks and other assets that typically correlate with higher rates could be on the move. How To Play It For investors betting on a Taylor Fed, the S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE:XME) is a decent play on a strong historical correlation between mining stocks and interest rates. Bank margins also typically get a boost by higher rates, making the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) another potential option. Finally, the most direct play on rising rates is The Sit Rising Rate ETF (NYSE:RISE), an ETF designed to produce a 10x levered return on interest rates.

2018-02-12,Finding Opportunity In Steel ETFs,"Perhaps not surprisingly, the materials sector, a high beta group, got caught up in the recent equity market sell-off. Year-to-date, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), the largest materials exchange traded fund by assets, is down 3.5 percent. Although the broader materials sector struggled in recent weeks, some analysts said opportunity remains with steel stocks. CFRA Research recently issued a favorable view on steel equities, including AK Steel Holding Corp.(NASDAQ:AKS) and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF). “Automakers have successfully reduced the weight of vehicles by hundreds of pounds; much more weight reduction is required, however, to meet new fuel efficiency standards,” CFRA equity analyst Matt Miller said in a recent note. “Innovations in steel technology have generated advanced high strength steels that strike the correct balance of strength, formability, weight and cost. Despite ongoing market share gains for aluminum and other composite materials, AHSS remains the preferred material in auto manufacturing.” Holding Up Pretty Well While XLB recently tumbled, the VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX) is higher by nearly 1 percent this year. The $161.8-million SLX holds 27 stocks, including a combined 3.1-percent allocation to Cleveland-Cliffs and AK Steel. “AKS produces virtually every grade of AHSS and is pursuing innovations in steel technologies, including advances in third-generation AHSS,” said CFRA's Miller. “During 2017, AKS acquired Precision Partners, a leader in advanced product design engineered solutions and tool design and build. Precision gives AKS an end-to-end solution, pairing AKS with Precision's tool and die and stamping capabilities. As of Feb. 8, AKS traded at a forward 12-month consensus EV/EBITDA of 6.6X, 13 percent below the 7.6x average of the broader steel market.” Year-to-date, investors have added about $10 million to SLX after pulling $61.3 million from the ETF last year. Other Ideas The $850.3-million SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) is a diversified play on metals and mining equities with an almost 48-percent weight to steel stocks, by far XME's largest industry exposure. XME is down about 5.6 percent this year, but it allocates 4.4 percent of its weight to Cleveland Cliffs. “By 2020, CLF expects to be the sole producer of hot briquetted iron in the Great Lakes region from its first production plant in Toledo, Ohio,” said CFRA. “HBI is a premium form of direct reduced iron with a high iron content (more than 90 percent) and is used as a substitute for scrap by electric arc furnaces. We think the HBI facility is a strategically important project (with strong capital returns), given the rise in EAFs (vs. blast furnaces). As of Feb. 8, CLF traded at a NTM consensus EV/EBITDA of 6.2x, an 18-percent discount to steel peers.” CFRA has a marketweight rating on XME.

2019-09-09,10 ETFs That Could Be Primed For A Short Squeeze,"Traders are always on the lookout for the next short squeeze candidate. Short squeezes can send share prices skyrocketing in a matter of minutes and hours, and traders who are along for the ride can make a killing just by timing one squeeze correctly. S3 Partners analyst Ihor Dusaniwsky released his latest list of the top short squeeze ETFs candidates based on short interest and short percent of float. Dusaniwsky said there are currently only 11 U.S. ETFs with short interest of at least $25 million and short percent of float of at least 40%. “Borrow rates on these ETF shorts are generally cheaper than equities with high SI % Float due to the ability for brokers to create ETFs as trading or stock borrow demand increases, although ETNs and leveraged ETFs usually have higher stock borrow rates due to the difficulty and expense of creating new shares,” Dusaniwsky wrote in the report. See Also: Short Squeeze Candidates: 10 Most Heavily Shorted Stocks Short Squeeze Candidates Here are S3’s 10 best ETF candidates for a potential short squeeze.

2021-07-09,Understanding SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF's Unusual Options Activity,"Shares of SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $43.58. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-07-23 Strike Price: $43.50 Volume: 1000 Open Interest: 8 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-07-13,Unusual Options Activity Insight: SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF,"SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved down to $43.06 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-07-30 Strike Price: $42.00 Volume: 1 Open Interest: 61 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock.

2021-07-22,Analyzing SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF's Unusual Options Activity,"Shares of SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) saw some unusual options activity on Thursday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $41.23. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2022-01-21 Strike Price: $33.00 Volume: 1501 Open Interest: 1563 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.

2022-05-11,"CNBC's Final Trades: Nvidia, Target, Metals & Mining And This Defensive Play","On CNBC’s “Halftime Report Final Trades,” Jon Najarian recommended SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME), adding “June 50 calls.” Jim Lebenthal of Cerity Partners named Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) as his final trade. “Whether you believe my correction call or not, we’re at least due for relief rallies.

2022-06-13,Is This ETF Ready To Rally?,"There’s a chance that the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) may be about to rally. And it’s because of seller’s remorse. As you can see on the chart below, the important $48 price level was a resistance level. Each time XME reached it, the sellers put a ceiling on the price. But now the price is higher and many of these investors regret selling. A number of these remorseful sellers decide to buy their shares back, but only if they can get them for the same price at which they sold. As a result, they place buy orders at the price that was previously resistance. If there are enough of these buy orders the level converts into support. That was the case on May 12 for XME and a move higher followed. There’s a chance it happens again. To learn more about trading, check out the new Benzinga Trading School."
2022-10-24,All That Glitters: What 3 Global Mining Companies Offer High-Yield Dividends?,"The iShares MSCI Global Select Metals & Mining Producers ETF (BATS:PICK) is down roughly 16.53% year-to-date. Despite being down, it was considerably better than the S&P 500 down nearly 21% year-to-date. This ETF offers access to the global mining industry through an international basket of companies engaged in the extraction and production of metals. Meanwhile, the international mining ETF’s rival SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) invested in U.S. mining companies and is up roughly 5.7 % year-to-date. This domestic mining ETF’s top 15 holdings include copper-heavy miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX), which has suffered in its third-quarter earnings due to falling copper prices. A factor to consider when investing in mining companies is that their dividend increases can be inconsistent over the years as commodity prices are volatile, especially when faced with high demand. Go To: Benzinga's Personal Finance Hub Educating You On Choosing The Appropriate Financial Resources Rio Tinto Group plc (NYSE:RIO) is offering a dividend yield of 9.86% or $5.34 per share annually, utilizing semiannual payments, with an unpredictable track record of increasing its dividends. Rio Tinto is a global diversified miner and its dominant commodity is iron ore, with significantly lesser contributions from copper, aluminum, diamonds, gold and industrial minerals. Market conditions were good, albeit below last year's record levels. We delivered largely flat production and solid financial results, with an underlying EBITDA of $15.6 billion. As a result, we are paying our second highest-ever interim dividend of $4.3 billion, a 50% payout, in line with our policy. The market environment has become more challenging at the end of the period,” said Rio Tinto’s CEO Jakob Stausholm. Vale SA (NYSE:VALE) is offering a dividend yield of 8.30% or $1.12 per share annually, making semiannual payments, with an inconsistent track record of increasing its dividends. Vale is a large global miner and the world's largest producer of iron ore and pellets. In recent years, the company has sold assets such as its fertilizer, coal and steel operations to concentrate on iron ore, nickel and copper. On May 6, Vale disclosed it entered into a long-term contract with Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) to supply class one nickel in the U.S. from its operations in Canada. Vale’s target is to deliver 30% to 40% of class one nickel sales into the fast-growing electric vehicle industry. Vale announced on May 16 that it concluded the buyback program started in October 2021, with 200 million shares repurchased at an average price of $ 17.56 per share totaling $3.5 billion. Vale also announced on April 27 that it started a new buyback program, which is limited to the maximum purchase of 500 million common shares and their respective ADRs. The new program will be implemented over the next 18 months from the announcement date. BHP Group Ltd (NYSE:BHP) is offering a dividend yield of 6.62% or $3.25 per share annually, conducting semiannual payments, with an infrequent track record of increasing its dividend payments. BHP Group is a global diversified miner supplying iron ore, copper, gold, metallurgical coal, nickel and potash. BHP CEO Mike Henry commented: “BHP delivered strong operational performance and disciplined cost control to realize record underlying earnings of $40.6 billion and record free cash flow of $24.3 billion.” In the second quarter of 2023 earnings release, BHP saw its nickel production grow by 16% quarter-over-quarter and copper production by 9%.

2023-04-11,S&P 500 Holds Steady While Tech Slides As Traders Await Key Inflation Print: Fed's Williams Says Another Hike Is 'Reasonable',"The market is shifting gears ahead of Wednesday's key inflation report and in preparation for the start of the earnings season. The Nasdaq 100 index of technology stocks fell, despite crypto-related startups rallying, as Bitcoin extended gains beyond $30,000. Large-cap companies fared relatively better. Treasury yields rose slightly. Investors assigned a 70% likelihood of a Fed rate hike next month. New York Federal Reserve President John Williams, who spoke Monday after the market close, said that one more rate hike is a reasonable starting place and added there is no evidence yet of a tightening of credit conditions. Cues From Tuesday’s Trading: The S&P 500 index was flat on the day, holding at about 4,100 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ticked higher by 0.4%, driven by gains in the industrials and health-care sectors. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index slipped 0.6%, pulled down by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), both of which fell more than 2%. U.S. Indices' Performance On Monday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite -0.4% 12,037.65 S&P 500 Index +0.08% 4,113.32 Dow Industrials +0.38% 33,722.07 Analyst Color: Despite job growth showing some softness, the unemployment rate remains at 50-year lows, providing the Federal Reserve with plenty of room to “stay higher for longer” within their stated goals, said fund manager Louis Navellier. Therefore, investors trying to time the market for a major rally from rate cuts in 2023 would probably be disappointed, he said. “A relief rally, however, when the Fed announces a pause in further cuts remains quite likely, though maybe short-lived, if unemployment does, in fact, start to rise from 3.5% to 4.5%,” he added. If results and forecasts from companies confirm that earnings contraction has bottomed in the first quarter, what the Fed does matters less, Navellier said. “Companies which retain pricing power and are addressing their cost structure will outperform indexes even if the Fed has to go even higher than expected to move closer to their objectives.” Tuesday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Monday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) edged 0.1% higher to $410.18, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.4% to $337.17 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) eased 0.6% to $316.05 according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-12,"Nasdaq, S&P 500 Price Action Reveals Anxiety As Traders Assess Inflation Data, Await Fed Minutes","The stock market is jittery after early excitement at the release of March inflation data faded throughout Wednesday's session, as investors worry the future of the Federal Reserve's monetary policies, with the minutes of the most recent FOMC meeting due Wednesday afternoon. The U.S. inflation rate slowed more than expected to 5% year-on-year in March, marking the lowest print since May 2021. Core inflation remained hot, ticking up from 5.5% in February to 5.6%, matching predictions. The Fed's Tom Barkin said inflation has peaked but the Fed still have a ways to go to get it under control. Investors presently estimate a 75% chance of another Fed interest rate rise in May, but expect this will be the final lift, with a first rate cut factored in as early as July. Cues From Wednesday's Trading: Stocks were volatile on Wednesday. Following the inflation report, major U.S. market indices soared before reversing the majority of gains in noon trade. The S&P 500 index was 0.2% higher on the day, but 0.8% lower than intraday highs. The Nasdaq 100 was flat, shedding 1.2% from intraday highs.

BofA said March CPI reading puts the Fed on pace to raise interest rates by 25 basis points at its May meeting. Despite the March improvement, the Fed believes that inflation is still far too high. Gapen expects the Fed to deliver on its dot-plot projection by hiking rates to 5%-5.25% as long as banking sector stress stays mild.

2023-04-13,"US Stocks Rally On Cooling Price Pressures, Softening Job Market: Investors Eye Fed Hike Cycle's Conclusion","A lower-than-expected producer inflation and higher-than-expected unemployment claims boosted risk appetite on Thursday, with all major U.S. equity indices posting sharp gains as investors increased speculations about the end of the rate hike cycle after the Fed's May meeting. Interest-rate sensitive mega caps, such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), have gained more than 2% on the day. A weaker greenback, with EUR/USD hitting fresh yearly highs, also supported stock advances. Cues From Thursday's Trading: Producer price inflation (PPI) decreased by 0.5% in March, falling short of forecasts for a flat monthly reading, while weekly unemployment claims surged by 11,000 to 239,000, above expectations. The two findings signal that a cooling trend in pricing pressures and the labor market is already underway. Stocks rallied across the board as investors wagered the Federal Reserve will stop raising in June and deliver the first reduction as early as July, according to latest CME Group FedWatch tool. The S&P 500 index gained 0.7%, returning above 4,100 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average grew 0.4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 outperformed, gaining 1.4%.

He noted the two-year Treasury yield is trading about 83 basis points lower than the midpoint of the fed funds rate. If the Fed is done with raising rates sooner, it could mean the central bank will tolerate further easing of financial conditions, Lee said. He thinks this is particularly likely if the markets worry about credit tightening as commercial real estate and commercial mortgage-backed securities and other commercial lending markets show stress. “We believe bears remain trapped and April is going to be a generally strong month (based upon “rule of first five days”),” the analyst said. He also raised the specter of April panning out to be a back-end-loaded month like March. “We would use any weakness from a post-March CPI sell-off to add to equity exposure,” Lee said. Thursday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Thursday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) edged 0.76% higher to $411.12, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.3% to $338.36 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) held steady at $317.62, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-14,US Stocks Plunge As Consumer Inflation Expectations Run Wild; Treasury Yields Climb As Fed Signals More Work Is Needed,"Friday's session is marked by rising risk aversion in the U.S. stock market, with all U.S. major indices in the red, despite some of the biggest U.S. financial institutions posting better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter. JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) shares surged 7% on the day after reporting record-high revenues in the quarter, up 25% on the year, and earnings per share of $4.10, well above the $3.41 expected. Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC), BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) also beat Wall Street's earnings estimates for the last quarter.

This, combined with general sentiment improving in April, has caused investors to be concerned about the future of Federal Reserve actions, with investors now pricing in a 25-basis-point increase in May with an 80% probability. Treasury yields spiked, with the yield on the two-year note rising 14 basis points to 4.11%. Recent inflation data is encouraging, according to Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, but prices are still rising too rapidly, necessitating additional Fed effort. The Fed's Christopher Waller said the Fed hasn't made much progress on inflation goal [and] rates need to rise further.

2023-04-18,"S&P 500, Nasdaq, Dow Erase Session Gains After Hawkish Fed Remarks: Investors Now Almost Fully Discount 25bp Hike In May","Tuesday's session was off to a good start for the U.S. stock market, extending gains from Monday's closing, until hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve officials came in. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said he still expects hikes and did not rule out pushing the Fed funds rate in the 5.5%-5.75% range. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic stated that he expects another rate rise in May, followed by a rate hold in June, stating that inflation remains too high. Investors now almost fully discount a 25-basis-point hike in May, according to the CME Group Fedwatch tool, and have also priced out a rate cut expected as early as July. Major U.S. companies reporting Tuesday, including Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:LMT), ProLogis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD) and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), reported better-than-expected EPS last quarter, ahead of Netflix's results due after market close. Cues From Tuesday's Trading: Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 were flat on the day, erasing early morning gains after Fed hawkish remarks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 0.1%, while small caps in the Russell 2000 tumbled 0.8%. U.S. Indices' Performance On Tuesday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite -0.07% 12,149.19 S&P 500 Index +0.01% 4,150.44 Dow Industrials -0.09% 33,957.18 Analyst Color: Adam Turnquist, the chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, delved into the likelihood of the continuation of the recent market rally. The S&P 500 is coming in hot to the first-quarter earnings season, having returned 5% over the past months, said Turnquist. This marked one of the biggest rallies into a reporting period since 2000, he added. Looking at precedents, the analyst noted that since 2000, there have been 27 other quarters when the S&P 500 rallied at least 3% four weeks before the start of earnings season. “These outlier returns historically point to continued upside momentum for the index after the kickoff of earnings season, albeit at a moderated pace,” he said. The average and median seven-week returns — marking the bulk of the earnings season, were 1.4% and 3.1%, respectively, the analyst said. He sees key upside resistance for the S&P 500 Index at 4,200. Tuesday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Tuesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was holding steady at $413.97, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) eased 0.1% to $339.35 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was unchanged at $318.88, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-21,S&P 500 Headed To Weekly Losses After Five Straight Wins As Investors Fear Higher Rates For Longer,"The stock rally that began in the middle of March appears to have stalled, with investors taking profits on the back of renewed rate concerns following upbeat economic data. The S&P US Manufacturing and Services PMIs came in above forecasts in April, indicating a resurgence of pricing pressures and pushing U.S. Treasury yields higher on Friday. The broad market S&P 500 Index traded flat in midday trading on Friday, and is set to conclude the first week in the red after five straight advances. Fed futures now almost fully discount a 25-basis-point hike in May. Investors assign a 70% likelihood for rates to stay unchanged at 5-5.25% in June. Bets for the first Fed rate cut to occur in September were further trimmed, with markets now assigning a less than 50% probability, according to the latest CME Group Fedwatch tool. Cues From Friday's Trading: Stocks traded in a tight range on Friday, as traders digested mixed earnings reports and macro data prints. Major equity indices opened lower and then attempted a rebound into noon trading. The S&P 500 Index was marginally weaker, down 0.07%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 eased 0.2% while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000 were flat on the day. U.S. Indices' Performance On Friday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq 100 -0.18% 12,984 S&P 500 Index -0.07% 4,128 Dow Industrials -0.01% 33,779 A recession now looks like a foregone conclusion, said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, citing the decline in the leading indicators index to the levels last seen in November 2020 when the economy was contending with the COVID-19 pandemic. “Historically, an economic contraction has closely followed a decline in the LEI of this magnitude,” the economist said. The head fake from last year’s two quarters of negative economic growth and the uncertainty from an aggressive Federal Reserve were likely culprits for pushing down the markets last year. The good news, however, is that Roach does not expect the markets to retest those lows despite the likelihood of a recession later this year. Friday's Trading In Major US Equity ETFs: In midday trading Friday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.05% lower at $411.7, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) weakened by 0.07% to $337.71 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 0.1% higher to $316.61, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-04-25,"US Stocks Tumble, VIX Spikes Ahead Of Mega-Tech Earnings; Investors Flock To Treasuries But Bond Market Says Something Will Break Soon...","A generalized risk-off, with investors fleeing equities and rushing to safe havens, marked Tuesday's session, as investors await the release of earnings from tech titans like as Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) after market close. The VIX fear index gained 8% on the day, while Treasuries drew demand from investors fleeing riskier assets, with rates falling on the key maturities and the 10-year hitting a 3.4% intraday yield.

He noted that 14 Dow components and 180 S&P 500 companies are due to release their quarterly results this week. If the Treasury yields rise this week, the Fed will be more likely to raise the Fed funds rate at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting scheduled for May 2-3, he said. Navellier also sees a split vote at the May meeting. “Due to mixed signals coming from different Fed districts, I think a split vote might be forthcoming at the May FOMC meeting,” he said.

The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — the core price consumption expenditure index — came in at 4.6% in March, down from the 4.7% a month earlier but slightly above expectations of 4.5%.

2023-09-01,7 Equity ETFs Excel In Goldilocks Scenario While Market Ponders Fed Rate Hike Outcome,"It has been a data-rich week, culminating with the Bureau of Labor Statistics releasing the August jobs report on Friday. Despite non-farm payrolls surpassing expectations at 187,000 versus the projected 170,000, the report revealed an uptick in the unemployment rate, rising from 3.5% to 3.8%, and wage growth falling short of predictions. On the same day, the ISM Manufacturing PMI showed a marginal increase from 46.4 to 47.6, though it remained in contraction territory. These numbers reaffirm the ‘not too hot, not too cold’ state of the economy, consistent with the PCE price index data – the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge – meeting expectations earlier in the week. Risk assets, especially stocks, are responding positively to this new ‘Goldilocks’ scenario for the U.S. economy, with investors increasingly confident that the latest economic data may lead the Fed to conclude its rate-hike campaign. Fed futures now indicate a 93% likelihood of unchanged rates in September and 63% in November, according to the CME Group Fed Watch Tool. The S&P 500 index, tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), has risen by 2.8% this week, putting it on track for its best weekly performance since the end of March 2023, the second-best of the year.

2023-09-14,"Inflation Surges, Consumer Demand Ignites Reflation Trade: Top 5 ETFs Dominating Thursday's Market","Thursday morning was marked by the release of significant economic data for the United States, setting the tone for the trading session. The producer price index rose by 0.7% month-on-month in August, jumping from July’s 0.3% increase and surpassing estimates of 0.4%. This represented the highest monthly price increase for producers since June 2022. Annual inflation among producers reached 1.6%, exceeding economists’ projections of 1.2%. The PPI’s unexpected rise comes on the heels of a higher-than-expected consumer price index report released just a day earlier. August CPI inflation increased to 3.7%, up from 3.2% in July, slightly above the anticipated 3.6%. These elevated figures have raised concerns about the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, as mounting inflation pressures could prompt the Fed to rethink its interest rate path. Despite the reactivation of inflationary pressures, American consumer demand remains strongly robust. August witnessed 0.6% month-on-month growth in retail sales, surpassing July’s 0.5% and beating expectations of 0.2%. This impressive streak marks the fifth consecutive month of rising retail sales. The resilience in consumer spending defies the gravitational pull of inflation and high interest rates, confounding market analysts and policymakers alike. Experts Weigh In On Reflation Phase Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment Officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, said consumers continue to spend more than anticipated despite the higher interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve now faces a tough task, as data coming in hotter than predicted could put increasing pressure on the central bank to consider raising rates once more at the November meeting, he said. Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, tried to cool down the excitement, stating that retail sales figures are not adjusted for inflation. The expert highlighted that the surge in August retail sales was primarily driven by an increase in gas purchases. When accounting for inflation, the economy shows signs of losing some momentum, although many businesses still enjoyed a strong summer with growing sales.
