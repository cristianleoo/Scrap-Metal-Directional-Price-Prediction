2009-12-09,Goldman Sachs Launches Coverage of MLM And VMC,"Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) initiated coverage of construction materials firms Martin Marietta (NYSE: MLM) and Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC). The bank rates the former a buy, and the latter a neutral. The bank is generally bullish on the industry, believing that “consensus drastically underestimates the impact of accelerating residential construction on aggregates demand.” As a result, Goldman’s 2011 estimates for the sector are around 20% above consensus. The bank favors Martin Marietta over Vulcan due to a more attractive valuation and better balance sheet capacity for mergers and acquisitions. MLM was up $2.56 in trading today to close at $85.06; VMC traded down 35 cents to $47.69."

2010-01-15,"Demand For Construction Materials Down, But Prices Stable (MLM, VMC)","The demand for construction materials was down 27% y/y. However aggregate prices have demonstrated signs of greater stability over prior months, although concerns remain about discounting on large highway projects that will lead to flat-to-down pricing in 1H10 and ~1% pricing for 2010. Analyst Garik Shmois from LONGBOW Research has revised his estimates for Martin Marietta Materials, Inc (NYSE: MLM) and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) to incorporate weaker volume in 4Q09E from wet weather and weaker than anticipated near-term demand, particularly in Texas. For Martin Marietta Materials, Inc, the analyst forecasts 4Q09E EPS of $0.33 (-$0.09), FY09E EPS of $2.30 (-$0.09) and FY10E EPS of $2.80 (-$0.75). The current FY09E EPS is at the low-to-mid end of management’s $2.20-2.45 guidance range. For Vulcan Materials Company, 4Q09E EPS has been reduced to ($0.05) vs. +$0.08 prior."

2010-02-10,"Rebound Delayed At MLM, But Intact","Analyst Timna Tanners of UBS maintains her buy rating on Martin Marietta (NYSE: MLM), while reducing her estimates for the company. The target price for MLM has been reduced from $102 to $97. Martin Marietta reported its Q4 results short of the estimates due to price weakness and a legal reserve. MLM’s Q1 guidance is also lower than the expectations due to project delays. “MLM’s view of non-res down 20% seems too negative given 09’s volume collapse… We see price up 1.4% (prior 2.7%) vs its outlook of a flat to 2% rise, aided by cost push,” the analyst adds. “We think Q4/Q1 marks the bottom and are confident rising volume will support margin recovery… Near-term catalysts are a longer extension on the road spending program and/or further stimulus,” the analyst says. UBS has reduced its EPS estimate for 2010 from $3.10 to $2.90. More Analyst Ratings here"
2010-02-11,Delays In Highway Bill Extension To Hurt Demand For MLM,"Analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets maintain their hold rating on Martin Marietta Materials Inc (NYSE: MLM), while reducing their estimates for the company. According to KeyBanc Capital Markets, MLM’s aggregate demand in 2010 is likely to be lower than the previous assumptions. “Our 2010 and 2011 estimates assume the Federal Highway Bill is funded at levels consistent with FY09,” the analysts say. “If the second stimulus is passed and other Federal Highway funding is at least consistent with 2010, EPS around $4.50-$5.00 is still possible in 2011,” the analysts mention. “However, given consistent delays in implementation of the stimulus and continued deterioration in private construction markets, we remain cautious about the pace of the recovery,” the analysts add. KeyBanc Capital Markets has reduced its EPS estimates for 2010 and 2011 from $3.15 to $2.35 and from $5.00 to $3.50, respectively. More Analyst Ratings here"
2010-02-24,Goldman Sachs Reinstates Terex (TEX) Neutral Rating,"Goldman Sachs analysts Terry Darling and Jerry Revich reinstated their Neutral rating of Terex Corp. (NYSE: TEX), with a 12 month price target of $24. The Goldman Sachs analysts said, we remain constructive on the outlook for recovery in US resi construction markets (8% of TEX revenue) in 2010 and non-res markets in 2011, but prefer Buy-rated Martin Marietta (MLM) within our coverage based on attractive valuation, longer-term favorable pricing power, and potential for accretive acquisitions. However, we believe expectations for TEX are low and that normalized earnings power (which we estimate at $2.50 in 2012) suggests significant upside potential longer-term even if signs of a recovery remain mixed currently. The analysts reduced 2010/11 EPS earnings estimates to ($0.60)/$1.40 from $0.10/$2.15."
2010-03-16,Exploring New Strategy Ideas and Potential New Long and Short Ideas for the Week,"Follow this link for a pdf of this report: Ascendere Equity Strategy, Long and Short Ideas, March 12, 2010.Track weekly long/short focus list ideas here.Time permitting, we have decided on a weekly basis to share some general equity strategy themes we are working on and updated long and short ideas. These weekly ideas are generated using the same framework as the Ascendere Long/Short Model Portfolio, which is updated monthly and is tracked intra-month. While some noise may be introduced by increasing the frequency of stock ideas generated, it may also help us find good ideas worth further study such as with a few of the detailed reports we have made public on McKesson (MCK), Starbucks (SBUX) or Joy Global (JOYG). Consistency may not always be the right strategyIf the overall performance of a portfolio is being hurt by low quality short positions in a rising market, it seems to makes more sense to reduce these positions, get rid of them completely or even buy them outright instead. Look at the Materials sector, for example. We explored what would happen to our model portfolio if: 1) in a rising market, we went all-in at 200% with 0% short positions; or 2) in a down market, we went 50% long and 150% short. We found the results fairly interesting. Next week we will explore the buy low quality strategy. Underweighting shorts could increase overall performance at the cost of more severe drawdownsOur original strategy shows a return of 203.65% since a 12/31/2004 inception, including a drawdown of 13% over 7 months in 2009 -- caused by underweighted short positions that nevertheless still had a negative impact. In contrast, this new and improved don't short what is going up strategy returned 581.98%. Unfortunately the new and improved strategy would not be viable for most people. This is because of more frequent and significant losses that may occur in any given month. For example, the new strategy suffered a drawdown of 14.3% over June and July of 2007, was down 13.56% in January 2008 and was down 14.45% in December 2008. Model portfolio on 10-to-1 leverage illustrates a familiar story from the summer of 2007The model portfolio using 10-to-1 leverage would have generated a 4,462.28% return -- even after losing 70.63% of the portfolio during the summer of 2007 and regularly experiencing 40% and 50% draw downs in any given month. This high cumulative return was driven largely by 2005 and 2006 results. A new investor at the beginning of 2008 in a hedge fund portfolio would have only realized a 60% return to date, but only after watching the portfolio swing up and down like a rabid starving monkey hanging from a rubber band. New Long and ideas for the WeekIn that spirit, we have updated a list of new long ideas and short ideas (or contrarian long ideas). Also included are changes to the previous week's list. New Long and ideas for the Week Of these new long ideas, we would focus our attention on Macy's, Inc. (M), Dick's Sporting Goods Inc. (DKS), Ultrapar Holdings Inc. (UGP) and the Bank of Montreal (BMO). This is because these stocks look like they can sustain their operating momentum for the next few quarters and they are new on our list. Put aside for a moment the idea that retailers shouldn't be going up, and that they have gone up too far already. These stocks are on this list for a reason -- the numbers still look very good. Granted, maybe you will find something you will not like, but do not let conventional wisdom dismiss these ideas outright. At a glance, DKS looks like it has more short-term potential than M right now. New Short and Contrarian Long Ideas for the Week We are loath to even put this list out. Anyone going short this market has been burned in recent weeks, especially those shorting low-quality stocks. Our models indicate that Carnival plc (CUK), Central European Distribution Corp. (CEDC) and Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (MLM) should all deserve some focus. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI) does not really belong on this list -- it is there because our models do not yet adjust pro forma for acquisitions or significant changes in operating structure and this is what has skewed some metrics. Just another illustration of the fallibility of some quantitative models. CEDC deserves a closer look -- why is this supposedly low-quality stock up 30.59% for the year-to-date? What are our factors missing? Off the Buy List We recall that a few sell side firms downgraded Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) this past week due to valuation. Interestingly, our models concurred with this move. All that could mean is that NFLX is moving into growth territory, so the stock could move some more. Ross Stores Inc. (ROST) has also had a good run, but some factors are relatively better compared to some other stocks in the sector. Just because a stock moves off a list does not mean it is always an automatic sell. Off the Sell List These stocks just do not look as ugly as they did last week. For example, Prudential plc (PUK) has already declined significantly; as a result, it's relative value is no longer significantly out of line with other Financials. A theory we have -- though not backtested, is that new stocks to our list that are showing good promise of further improvements in operating momentum should outperform. We are not sure if a weekly list captures noise or value, but we are taking a look. We would like to study some of these stocks and see if we can discern any additional quantitative or qualitative factors that may consistently influence stock prices going forward."

2010-08-09,Vulcan Faces Credit Rating Cut - Analyst Blog,"Vulcan Material Co.’s (VMC ) corporate credit rating has been pruned to “BBB-” from “BBB” by the Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P). S&P assesses that the company’s performance will not match the expectations for the upcoming quarters. Its rating outlook, however, stays “stable”. The rating agency pointed out that the company’s second quarter operating earnings and EBIDTA underperformed expectations. The miss was largely due to lower aggregate pricing, higher fuel costs and higher cost of liquid asphalt. Aggregate shipments failed to mitigate the negative impacts. However, the stable outlook is maintained as the second half of 2010 is expected to show some improvement. Increased highway and infrastructure spending may add substantially to the company’s volume and hence, profitability. The high interdependence between the currently unstable housing and the construction industries has caused the latter to suffer. The housing markets of Florida and California are among the worst affected, which constitute Vulcan’s biggest markets. Moreover, increased competition from companies such as Cemex (CX), Cement Roadstone Holdings (CRH), Lafarge Coppee SA (LFRGY) and Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (MLM) will also pose serious problems for Vulcan’s business in the near future. The company has recently started shifting its focus from private projects to public ones such as highways, roads and bridges. Such projects deliver both certainty and consistency in terms of business and income even in the case of economic fluctuations. Vulcan recorded a net profit of $20.5 million or 15 cents per share in the second quarter ended on June 30, 2010 compared with the year-ago profit of $15.6 million or 14 cents per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents per share. Total revenues grew marginally by $14 million over the last year quarter’s revenue of $722 million.

2010-09-08,3 Sectors That Would Benefit From Another Stimulus Bill,"Congress is currently discussing another stimulus package. This one would not be like the first package which was loaded with tax cuts and spending on healthcare, information technology, and education. This package would go directly to improving our bridges, highways, dams, and tunnels. If Congress does pass a $50 billion dollar infrastructure stimulus bill, these are the sectors that would benefit the most. Industrial stocks Chicago Bridge & Iron (CBI), Jacobs Engineering (JEG), Foster Wheeler (FWLT), and Manitowoc (MTW) are a few of my favorite companies in this sector. These companies have their hands in every stage of the construction and engineering process. Both firms would benefit substantially from an infrastructure stimulus package. Materials Manufacturer Stocks Vulcan Materials(VMC), Eagles Materials (EXP), Martin Marietta (MLM), and Astex Industries (ASTE) all produce the materials that are used for industrial and commercial construction. These materials are used to cementing and asphalting roads and highways. Metals Producer Stocks The federal government may issue the money but they can’t complete their projects without basic materials. Steel will be needed from the nation’s largest steel producers. That includes companies like U.S. Steel (X), AK Steel (AKS), Nuecor (NUE) and Mittal Steel (MT). The first stimulus plan should have had more spending in the infrastructure arena. Although this plan is only for $50 billion dollars, it should help tp boost the revenues of many of these companies. It may be abit late but I suppose that something is better than nothing at all.

2010-10-13,Lots of Ways to Invest Like Warren Buffett,"Billionaire Warren Buffett is the second richest American. As most investors know, he is the head of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A), the highest priced stock and one of the most successful companies during the last half-century. The company also has Class B shares (BRK-B), currently trading around 83.75, is another way to invest with Buffett. The Class B common share is equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the Class A shares. However, there are other ways to invest in Berkshire Hathaway.The Boulder Total Return Fund (BTF) has over 27% of its portfolio in Berkshire A shares plus another 12% in Berkshire B shares, so in excess of 39% of the investment assets in Buffett's company. Other stocks the closed end fund owns includes:Yum (YUM)Wal-Mart (WMT)Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Another alternative is by owning shares in the Sequoia Fund (SEQUX), a mutual fund with a large position in Berkshire Hathaway. Over 15% of their portfolio is invested in the stock. Some of the other stocks in their portfolio include:IDEXX Labs (IDXX)TJX (TJX)Martin Marietta (MLM)Fastenal (FAST)Mohawk Industries (MHK)The minimum investment in Sequoia is $5,000.A third way to invest is by investing in the Fairholme Fund (FAIRX) which has a little over 6% of their portfolio invested in Berkshire. Although the concentration is not as significant as Sequoia, it is the number three holding in the portfolio, as measured by percentage of assets. Fairholme's other major holdings include:Sears (SHLD)Goldman Sachs (GS)Citigroup (C)WellPoint (WLP)Minimum investment is $10,000.Markel Corp. (MKL) is an insurance company that many consider to be a mini-Berkshire, especially since it has a substantial amount of Berkshire Hathaway stock. There are other funds that have around two percent of their portfolio in Berkshire, such as Legg Mason ClearBridge Appreciation A (SHAPX) but the percentage isn't enough to be a close play on Berkshire.One other option is to create a portfolio that emulates Berkshire's holdings of publicly traded stocks, however, this wouldn't cover Berkshire's holdings of non-public stocks. In addition, it would involve purchasing many different stocks, so you would be better off just buying the Class B shares. But if you think that you can out-perform Buffett using his ideas, then here is a list of a few of their Berkshire's major stockholdings:American Express Co. (AXP)The Coca-Cola Company (KO)ConocoPhillips (COP)Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)Procter & Gamble Co. (PG) For a free downloadable list of all of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway stockholdings, which can be changed, added to, and sorted by yield and forward PE, go to WallStreetNewsNetwork.com.Disclosure: Author does not own any of the above.By Stockerblog.com"

2010-11-18,Homebuilding Demolished! - Zacks Industry Rank Analysis,"Industry Rank Analysis 11-18-10 The Construction industry has been demolished over the last few years, and it does not look like it will be rebuilt anytime soon. Housing starts are down about 75% from peak levels and are below year-ago levels, and a year ago things were pretty depressed. Historically, residential investment is the locomotive that pulls the economy out of recessions. The fact that the locomotive is derailed is the primary reason this recovery has been so sluggish. Several of the firms related to homebuilding -- either the homebuilders or the suppliers of building materials -- are showing up as among the very worst, based on the Zacks Rank. The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 256 different industries tracked. It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well -- a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts. What is interesting is when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list. The same holds true for the bottom of the list. Four “industries” in the overall Home Construction industry are showing up very poorly based on the Zacks Rank. The worst of the bunch are the cement makers, coming in 245th place (tie) out of the 256 industries tracked, a deterioration of 30 spots from last week. The average Zacks Rank for the seven firms in the group rose (rising is bad) to 3.71 from 3.29. Right behind them are the miscellaneous building products in 244th place, slipping 3 spots from last week with an average score of 3.68 vs. 3.63 last week. The Heating and Air Conditioning industry is in 230th place, an improvement of one slot from last week with an average score of 3.50 (unchanged). Finally are the Homebuilders themselves, in 212th place, a deterioration of 28 spots from last week as the average score rose to 3.31 from 3.15. The first table below shows the Homebuilding and related stocks that hold the dreaded Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell). The second table shows the Zacks #4 Ranked (Sell) firms. There is a range of market capitalizations to choose from between the two lists, although most are in the small- to mid-cap area. That might make it difficult to short these firms, and they might not have options available which would make the “buy a put” strategy impossible to implement, but that is not true for all of these firms. In addition to the weak estimate momentum, the valuations on these firms are not particularly appealing (a NA indicates and expected loss for the period). There will be a time to own these names, but now is not the time.

It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks Industry Rank is. The Zacks Industry Rank is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800 lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank. Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list. After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank of #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 255 industries tracked. The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Thus, I do not always focus on the very highest rated industries, but on the highest rated ones in which there are a large number of firms.

2010-12-28,Puts Purchased on Martin Marietta Materials (MLM),"Shares of Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM) are higher on the session by 0.43%, currently trading at $93.00. The stock has been moving largely higher over the past four months and is currently trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Options traders are buying puts on the name today. A short while ago the January 2011 $95.00 put was purchased 1,000 times, on the offer, for $3.50 on open interest of only 274 contracts. This signals new positioning on the name. Overall put volume is now running at 6.38x the daily average with 96% of all puts traded being purchases on the offer. Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. engages in the production and sale of aggregates for the construction industry in the United States, Canada, the Bahamas, and the Caribbean Islands. Martin Marietta Materials was founded in 1993 and is based in Raleigh, North Carolina."
2010-12-29,Tough Environment for Swing Traders  12-28-2010,"Cusick's Corner The market continued to whip around unchanged to slightly positive levels for the remainder day -- the March S&P settled at 1254.25. This type of action can be expected for a holiday week, plus throw in the snowstorm out East which left many traders at home. It's been a tough environment to be trading stocks and for swing traders, it's been a difficult range, just too tight. There is no economic data due out until Thursday, but a few stocks are going ex-div, like KFT tomorrow which is the most active, could create an early, momentary lift in the morning. See you Midday. Stocks finished mixed in another day of slow trading Tuesday. Economic data was in focus early after the Conference Board reported that its index of Consumer Confidence fell to 52.5 in December, from 54.3 the month before. Economists were looking for an increase to 56.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen into the red prior to the data and showed little reaction to the report. The Dow then started a steady grind higher through midday and into the second half of trading. Chevron Texaco (CVX) was the Dow's best gainer after crude oil rose towards $91.50 a barrel. Gold was shining as well and rallied beyond $1,400 an ounce. Meanwhile, the Dow traded in a narrow 50-point range and finished up 21 points points. Trading has practically stalled and, after an 18-poinit loss yesterday, the industrial average has now added just 3 points on the week. Bullish Flow Popular (BPOP) shares gained a nickel to $3.08 and options volume hit 3X the recent average daily after 12,000 calls and 175 puts traded on the San Juan, Puerto Rico bank. February $3 calls were the most actives. 7,680 traded. Most of the action was in smaller lots. The top trade was 638 contracts at 25 cents each and traded on the International Securities Exchange, where sentiment data indicate that a customer bought-to-open a new position. April 3 calls were busy as well, with another 3,380 traded. No news on the stock, but the flow seems to reflect expectations that, after about seven months of mostly sideways trading, BPOP shares are due to rally in the months ahead. Bullish order flow was also seen in Pfizer (PFE), Education Management (EDMC), and GM. Bearish Flow MannKind (MNKD) moved up 26 cents to $8.23 and options volume jumped after the FDA delayed a decision on the company's Afrezza treatment, which was due December 29. The decision was delayed about four weeks. The news triggered a flurry of options activity, as some investors closed out positions in January options and opened new ones in February. The top trades were an apparent liquidation, in which an investor sold 3,800 January 9 calls at 45 cents each. The next biggest trade was apparently a roll of January 5 calls to February 5 calls, with an investor collecting 13 cents, 3323X, and rolling a position in short calls out an additional month, into the now-delayed FDA decision. Bearish flow also picked up in Career Education (CECO), Lincoln Education Services (LINC), and Martin Marietta (MLM). Index Trading Volume remains very light in the index market, as many institutional players are away for the holidays and others are still digging out from the massive snowstorm in the Northeast. One index that will be worth watching heading into 2011 is the CBOE Ten-Year Rate Index (.TNX). It saw an impressive rally Tuesday, gaining 1.30 to 34.81. The gain in TNX happened as the ten-year Treasury note had a rough day and lost 1 5/32nd. In the past, selling in Treasurys can spill over into the equity market, as the fear of higher rates sends investors fleeing out of riskier assets. However, there was little reaction to the spike in bond yields today, but that will likely change if the trend continues into early 2011. ETF Trading Market Vectors Russia Fund (RSX) saw more interest than usual today. Shares gained 7 cents to $37.44 as the Russian ruble hit two-month highs against the dollar. Investors are showing interest in Russia's currency and equity markets as crude oil prices have been strong and about one quarter of the Russian economy is driven by energy. Meanwhile, in the US, investors were snapping up call options on the Russia Fund. 15,000 contracts traded, which is almost 10X the typical activity and more than 5X the day's put volume. January 38 calls traded almost 15,000X. February 37 puts were actively traded as well, with 2,715 changing hands."
2011-01-05,Crumbling Cement - Zacks Industry Rank Analysis,"Industry Rank Analysis 1-5-11 The spending from the Stimulus Bill (ARRA) is rapidly running out, and in the current environment it is highly unlikely to be renewed. A fairly significant part of the ARRA was spending on public construction projects such as roads and bridges. Construction in the private side of the economy is also far from robust. Not surprisingly, then, the Zacks Ranks of several building related industries are currently very weak. In this article I will focus on two of the industries that are among the worst -- Cement and Miscellaneous Building Products. I would point out that there are other related industries, such as the Building Products Retailers, Lighting Fixtures and the Home Builders themselves are not looking too good either. Also, the several of the steel-related industries look weak, and construction, particularly public and commercial, tend to also use a lot of steel. Cement demand is closely tied to public construction activity. Almost by definition, the Miscellaneous group is harder to characterize, but it appears that many of them are also sensitive to public construction, though they are often more tied to residential construction. Not that it really matters; both areas look pretty dicey for 2011. The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 255 different industries tracked. It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well -- a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts. It is interesting, however, when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list...or at the bottom. The Cement industry is about average size with 7 firms, although none of them are exactly mega caps. The industry is in 254th place of the 255 industries we track -- an unusually poor showing for an average-sized industry. It deteriorated by five spots over the last week. Its average Zacks Rank is 4.14, up (bad) from 3.71 last week. The Miscellaneous building products industry is bigger than with 17 firms in it. It is currently in the 229th spot on the list of industries with an average Zacks Rank of 3.35, although that is an improvement of 15 spots from last week when the average rank was 3.65. The first table below shows the Cement and Miscellaneous Building Products stocks that hold the dreaded Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell). The second table shows the Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) firms. Most of the firms are on the small side, and thus might be difficult to short, or not have options available to buy puts on them. There are a few larger firms on the #4 list, even if they are based abroad. In addition to looking ugly based on estimate momentum and surprises, none of these firms look particularly compelling on a P/E basis, even using 2011 earnings. An N/A in the P/E column means that the company is expected to be in the red that year. Expectations are falling fast, and an estimate in motion tends to remain in motion. In other words, the actual earnings could be much lower, and thus the true P/Es much higher. People buying these stocks have to be doing so on the hope of a turnaround. A Zacks score of #4 or #5 means that the turnaround is not likely to happen anytime soon. Turnaround situations that don't turn are the best stocks to avoid. In general, it is still to early to bet on a rebound in the construction sector, unless you have a very strong contrarian bent and a long investment time horizon.

2011-02-09,Sterne Agee Has Neutral Rating On Martin Marietta Materials (MLM),"Sterne Agee has a Neutral rating and a $90 price target on shares of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM). In a note to clients, Sterne Agee writes, MLM's 4Q10 results proved that its cost-cutting actions over the last several years are paying off, as the company reported a strong incremental margin of 62% (it has been targeting 60%). While the worst appears to be behind us in terms of end-market demand and pricing, the pace and timing of an eventual recovery remains uncertain in our view given the lack of a multi-year Highway Bill, the questionable sustainability of a residential recovery, and finding a bottom in non-residential construction. Additionally, shares continue to trade at the higher end of historic valuation ranges based on forward estimates. We have adjusted our 2011/2012 EPS to $2.50/$3.40 from $2.55/$3.34 to reflect lower volume in 2011 (up 2% vs. 5% previously), but mitigated by lower interest expense. We maintain our Neutral rating and our $88 price target, reflective of shares trading 10.5X our FY12E EBITDA, which is slightly below the “normalized” peak-trough average level. Shares of MLM gained $2.03 yesterday to close at $90.65, a gain of 2.3%."

2011-06-03,Goldman Sachs Brings Asset Allocation Savvy to Its 401K Plan,"Retirement investing is a long term process. This report reviews The Goldman Sachs 401(k) Plan . We will discuss the investment choices and present the plan rating by MyPlanIQ. Current economic and market conditions are discussed in the context of the investment portfolios in the plan. We will then show how investors in The Goldman Sachs 401(k) Plan can achieve reasonable investment results using asset allocation strategies. Plan Review and Rating As one of the largest investment banks in the world, Goldman Sachs (GS) does give its employees ample diversification opportunities. The plan consists of 36 funds. These funds enable participants to gain exposure to 6 major assets: US Equity, Foreign Equity, Commodity, Emerging Market Equity, REITs, Fixed Income. As of Jun 2, 2011, this plan investment choice is rated as average based on MyPlanIQ Plan Rating methodology that measures the effectiveness of a plan's available investment funds. It has the following detailed ratings: Diversification -- Rated as great (100%) Fund Quality -- Rated as below average (14%) Portfolio Building -- Rated as average (52%) Overall Rating: average (55%) It is a bit surprising that the plan's fund quality is rated below average. In the plan, other than the low cost index funds, it provides many Goldman Sachs funds such as Goldman Sachs Asset Management L.P./Structured US Equity Fund (GSELX). This could possibly help your own fund business with the expense of lower qualities. We don't know what cost the plan is charged for these funds. Current Economic and Market Conditions As we are clearly entering a seasonally weak period for risk assets, global economies have clearly slowed down. Recently released Case-Shiller housing index showed that the U.S. is now in a double dip state for housing prices. Unemployment rate has been stuck at 9% level. Additional indicators such as conference board consumer confidence index and Chicago ISM index are all pointing to a slow down in the summer season. Amid a string of bad economic news, risk assets have come down a bit, though they are still ranked high at the moment. Long term treasury bonds, however, have shot up in the anticipation of weakened economy. The following table shows the major asset class ranking in terms of their momentum.

2011-12-12,Is the Vulcan Materials Acquisition Likely? ,"Turbulent markets often prevent financial transactions from taking place. For example, when equity markets are extremely violent, companies are wary of issuing public equity securities. The same principle affects the debt capital markets. Mergers and acquisitions are also affected severely, as they often require large obligations to be undertaken by the acquiring company. During uncertain times, companies that do end up taking over other entities often do so with fierce conviction. Whether a company is a strategic or financial buyer, it should have several reasons for why a company is a good target. Recently, Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM) offered Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC) $4.7 billion in a hostile bid. While the merger is far from confirmed, investors must consider why the merger should occur in the first place. For a strategic buyer like Martin Marietta, one of the first things it should consider is how the acquisition will improve existing market share. The first thing to notice is that both companies offer similar, yet different, products. Vulcan Materials is a large producer of asphalt and other cement products, while Martin Marietta manufactures chemical and lime-based products. Vulcan also operates in various states including California, Virgina, Florida, and Texas. Martin Marietta currently operates in Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, and Louisiana. While there may be some overlap in Texas' operations, the value added from the other states is likely to outweigh the cons. Investors should also consider if the acquisition is likely to save costs. Since the companies produce fairly similar products, they may be able to streamline costs by consolidating work forces or factories. Reducing overhead is extremely likely in this particular case. One of the few downsides to this is that certain jobs will probably be made redundant, and workforce downsizing may be imminent. Martin Marietta Materials also has to consider various financial characteristics underlying Vulcan Materials' business model. For example, the way Vulcan funds its operations is extremely important. Acquirers want to see cash flow positive companies that do not necessarily fund itself via extensive debt and equity issuances. Vulcan has a history of consistent debt and equity issuances, but appears to have calmed down recently as far as capital markets activity goes. Vulcan Materials' financial situation could be more positive, but it has consistently paid back its debt. It has also been able to boost overall cash flows over the last several years, with no help from financing activities. Balance sheet modifications in working capital along with depreciation add-backs bolstered cash flows. Inventories and stock-based compensation were two key drivers, and both appear to have affected the company positively over the last five years. Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials have a long way to go before ironing out all the details behind the possible acquisition, but it may seem to be a good match. The strategy behind the acquisition appears to identify key synergies that may be able to skyrocket both companies in the industrials sector. Moreover, the two would be able to combine existing resources to efficiently mold both companies into one entity. Martin Marietta Materials is currently trading at about $75.75, down 18.5% for the year. Vulcan Materials Company is currently trading at about $39.05, down 28% for the year . ACTION ITEMS:Bullish View:Traders who believe that the Vulcan Materials/Martin Marietta acquisition will complete might want to consider the following trades: Long Vulcan Materials by purchasing shares or call options. Vulcan currently appears to be close to a technical support level, so now may be a good time to buy.Short another similar company, like US Concrete (NASDAQ: USCR). You could short this company to hedge a long VMC trade or to accentuate your belief that Vulcan Materials will continue to dominate the asphalt production market.Long an ETF like the Industrials SPDR (NYSE: XLI). If a significant industry like construction is doing well, industrials itself will probably do well.Bearish View:Traders who believe that the acquisition will not take place may consider the following positions:Short Vulcan Materials until it reaches $34, which is the level it was at before the unsolicited offer by Martin Marietta Materials; it also appears to be a technical support level. The next support level appears to be at about $31.Long a competitor like Texas Industries (NYSE: TXI), as someone bearish on Vulcan may believe that a specialized competitor is more likely to garner market share.Buy put options as Vulcan Materials' earnings announcement comes along. The company may not be able to sustain its costs as precious metals rallied significantly in Q3 2011.Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

Sun Healthcare Investor Seeks Sale of Company The News: Sun Healthcare Group (NASDAQ: SUNH) investor Clinton Group, sent a letter to the Board of Directors of Sun to urge the Board to sell the company. In particular the letter noted that: Clinton believes Sun is undervalued in the public markets; Clinton believes Sun has sufficient liquidity, could continue to successfully operate as a standalone business, and has access the debt markets for refinancing; but Clinton believes a sale today would maximize shareholder value because such a sale would likely yield Sun shareholders a price in the $6-8 range, given that the likely buyers could save substantial operating and back-office costs, trade at higher multiples, and have more scale than Sun. Sun Healthcare shares traded in a range of $3.07 to $3.72 on 3 times the average daily volume and closed at $3.69, a gain of 17.50% for the day."
2011-12-19,From Earlier: Martin Marietta Materials Sends Letter to Board of Directors of Vulcan Materials Company  ,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) on Saturday announced that it has delivered a letter to the Board of Directors of Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC). The full text of the letter is below: I am writing to you, the Board of Directors of Vulcan Materials Company, regarding the proposal Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. announced on December 12, 2011 to combine with Vulcan. In part the purpose of this letter is to provide you with additional context regarding our views on the combination as you are considering our proposal. In addition, I am quite concerned that Vulcan's position as presented in the court papers filed by Vulcan late on Friday in the Superior Court of New Jersey seriously mischaracterizes the transaction we have proposed and rejects it even though, according to the papers, Vulcan's Board of Directors has not taken a public position on Martin Marietta's proposal. Statements in Vulcan's New Jersey court papers that our proposal is an attempt “to snatch Vulcan for the lowest possible price and on [Martin Marietta's] own terms”, and is “burdened…with a bevy of conditions that make…any closing unrealistic” are simply inaccurate. The offer we announced on December 12th gives Vulcan shareholders the means to realize the substantial benefits resulting from a combination of our two companies. The sole meaningful obstacle would be Vulcan Board opposition if the Board chooses that path. On that point, the court papers state that “the approval of Vulcan's board of directors …has no likelihood of being satisfied any time in the foreseeable future, if ever.” (Emphasis added.) This is a remarkable statement on behalf of a Board of Directors that purportedly has not taken a public position on our proposal. If true, this acknowledged predetermination by the Vulcan board to refrain from engaging in meaningful discussions with Martin Marietta clearly is contrary to the best interests of Vulcan and its shareholders. Indeed, it seems likely that a prolonged process would destroy value for Vulcan shareholders, who could lose the opportunity to receive much earlier or completely an up-front premium, reinstatement of a meaningful dividend, and the transformation of their investment in Vulcan into a 58% stake in a combined company that is decidedly stronger – financially, operationally and strategically. As to our views on the combination, in developing our proposal to combine the businesses of Martin Marietta and Vulcan, we carefully considered many factors from the standpoint of the shareholders of both companies. We recognized that our proposed transaction must be value-enhancing both to the Vulcan shareholders and the Martin Marietta shareholders. The exchange ratio of 0.50 of a Martin Marietta share for each Vulcan share, and the resulting 58% / 42% equity split between Vulcan's and Martin Marietta's shareholders in the combined company, reflect the value contributed by each company. We believe the combination on the terms proposed presents a compelling value-enhancing opportunity for the shareholders of both companies. This combination is a rare opportunity and, unless evidence of additional value is presented by Vulcan, is one that both companies should pursue on the terms proposed. As we have repeatedly said, our strong preference is to negotiate an agreement with Vulcan that will benefit both sets of shareholders. We are not dissuaded by what may be intemperate rhetoric of litigation. We look forward to your response and to commencing discussions in order to effect this compelling, value-enhancing opportunity."

2011-12-22,Martin Marietta Materials Responds to Vulcan Materials Company Announcement to Reject Exchange Offer   ,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) issued the following statement in response to today's announcement by Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC): Ward Nye, Martin Marietta President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The announcement made by Vulcan today in response to our business combination proposal does not change our view – and we believe, the view of many Vulcan shareholders – that our offer represents a compelling opportunity for Vulcan's shareholders and all of its other constituencies. Vulcan misses the point by ignoring the significant incremental value creation inherent in this combination. We are proposing a stock-for-stock merger combination in which Vulcan shareholders would own over 58% of the combined company and receive an upfront premium based on pre-announcement stock prices. The transaction would create a U.S.-based company that is the global leader in construction aggregates with a footprint reaching across North America. The combined company would be well-positioned for growth and success with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and a dividend that is 20 times Vulcan's current level. Despite the rhetoric by Vulcan, the only real obstacle to delivering to Vulcan's shareholders the substantial benefits of the proposed combination is the opposition of Vulcan's Board of Directors. With the support of the Vulcan Board, our offer would be subject only to ordinary course conditions, and we have no reason to believe such conditions would not be satisfied on a prompt basis. In particular, as we have previously stated, we do not believe there are any significant regulatory or legal hurdles to completion of the proposed business combination. In addition, while we believe the proposed exchange ratio and equity split between Vulcan and Martin Marietta is appropriate and compelling, we would consider in good faith demonstrable evidence of additional value. “It remains Martin Marietta's strong preference to meet with Vulcan to engage in discussions in order to reach a definitive agreement to combine our two companies. Since announcing our proposal on December 12, 2011, we have spoken with a number of Vulcan shareholders, many of whom are also Martin Marietta shareholders, and we are pleased with the support we have received regarding the combination and the powerful financial and operational benefits it is expected to deliver. We are committed to completing this combination and are moving forward on a number of fronts to make it a reality. We encourage Vulcan shareholders to send a strong message to their Board that the proposed combination is a compelling opportunity for Vulcan's shareholders, customers, employees and communities,” Mr. Nye concluded. As previously announced, on December 12, 2011, Martin Marietta commenced an exchange offer in which each outstanding share of Vulcan will be exchanged for 0.50 Martin Marietta shares. The offer represents a premium for Vulcan shareholders of 15% to the average exchange ratio based on the closing share prices for Vulcan and Martin Marietta during the 10-day period ended December 9, 2011 and 18% to the average exchange ratio based on the closing share prices for Vulcan and Martin Marietta during the 30-day period ended December 9, 2011.

Vulcan's shareholder presentation suffers from numerous inaccuracies and mischaracterizations, which we will address promptly.

2012-01-11,From Earlier: Vulcan Comments on Martin Marietta Presentation  ,"Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) issued the following statement on the shareholder presentation released by Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) today: Martin Marietta's presentation provides nothing new on the merits of its hostile offer. Vulcan held talks with Martin Marietta over many months and determined that a combination did not make economic sense for the Company and would not enhance value for Vulcan shareholders. Martin Marietta misrepresents the potential value from the combined company: its synergy assessment is unrealistically aggressive and it ignores the value destruction resulting from divestitures. Vulcan's assessment of antitrust risk makes use of its experience on the most relevant transactions in the industry, and Vulcan's assessment of its standalone prospects is based on analyst consensus views. We encourage our respective shareholders to carefully analyze the validity of Martin Marietta's claims. Vulcan will continue to meet with our shareholders and share our vision for Vulcan's future."

2012-05-16,Einhorn Brings The Pain on Martin Marietta ,"Shares of North Carolina-based Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM), a producer of granite, limestone, sand, gravel, and other products used for construction and infrastructure projects, plunged 8.2% today on volume that was roughly eight times the daily average after Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn made negative comments about the company at the Ira Sohn Conference. Martin Marietta was recently rebuffed in its hostile takeover bid for rival Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC), prompting comments from Einhorn that compared the company to Yahoo (Nasdaq: YHOO). Einhorn's bearish view of Martin Marietta forced a circuit breaker halt in trading of the stock this afternoon. The hedge fund manager, whose bearish bets include Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (Nasdaq: GMCR), Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS), and Herbalife (NYSE: HLF), compared Martin Marietta CEO Howard Nye to former Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson, calling Nye a megalomaniac along the way. With Tuesday's slide, shares of Martin Marietta have lost about 25% in the past three months."
2012-05-17,Ira Sohn Investment Conference Market Movers for Thursday,"The annual Ira Sohn Investment Conference was held in New York on Wednesday. At the event, which supports the treatment and cure of pediatric cancer, many of the world's most successful hedge fund managers and other noteworthy investors pitch stock ideas to their colleagues. The investment ideas presented at Ira Sohn frequently cause large price moves in the individual stocks being discussed, and the 2012 conference was no exception. Among the heavy-hitters that presented this year were Greenlight Capital founder David Einhorn, Pershing Square founder Bill Ackman and Paulson & Co. chief John Paulson. Below, Benzinga recounts the stocks they discussed in their presentations and how those names are faring on Thursday. David Einhorn - In today's markets, this boyish looking hedge fund manager may be the most influential voice when it comes to individual stocks. Einhorn's short bets on companies such as Lehman Brothers and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ: GMCR) have brought him great sway on Wall Street. While Einhorn isn't always right, when he is, it is usually in dramatic fashion. When the Greenlight Capital manager did not mention Herbalife (NYSE: HLF) as a potential short candidate, that stock skyrocketed on Wednesday. Herbalife shares finished up 16.66% to $49.51. On Thursday, however, HLF is retracing some of yesterday's gains and at last check was trading down 6.00% to $46.53. Previously, HLF had plunged after Einhorn asked some pointed question on an earnings conference call. The presence of the hedge fund manager on the call was enough to spook investors who had feared that Einhorn may be targeting the company on the short side. Other companies that he addressed included Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) whose future he described as a riddle. While Amazon has been tremendously successful, its earnings multiple is also stratospheric for such a large company. The hedge fund manager made bearish comments on a couple of other names including Martin Marietta (NYSE: MLM) and Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS). Both of those stocks are continuing to fall on Thursday. At last check, MLM was down 1.30% to $67.71 after falling yesterday during Einhorn's speech and DKS had shed another 4.63% to $45.72. On the bullish side, Einhorn had only positive things to say about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Of course, this makes sense, seeing as how Greenlight has a massive $878 million position in the company, which accounts for around 16% of the fund's long equity portfolio. John Paulson - best known for making billions for himself and his investors by betting against the housing market before the crash, Paulson also spoke at Ira Sohn. Unlike Einhorn, who loves to talk about shorts despite the fact that he is a long-oriented value investor, Paulson talked about his long ideas. He said that he owns shares of Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR), which went public in February. According to Paulson, the company's social gaming platform Lakita is worth $8 per share alone. On Thursday, CZR shares have added 1.63% in a bad market tape and were last trading at $13.70. The company came public at $9.00 per share. Another long idea that the hedge fund manager spoke about is long-term Paulson & Co. position AngloGold Ashanti Limited (NYSE: AU). This stock is a bit of a dog, but the billionaire is convinced that it will eventually be a big money maker. Over the last year, AU shares are down more than 27% and over the course of the last five years the stock has lost 24% despite skyrocketing gold prices. Paulson told the audience that AngloGold is firing on all cylinders and that current prices make an attractive entry point. He also added that it is cheaper to get exposure to gold through AU than through an ETF or futures. Paulson said that he thinks AU may have as much as 75% upside from current levels. On Thursday, AU has jumped 3.13% to $32.66 on the back of the hedge fund manager's considerable sway in the investment community. The final stock that Paulson talked about was CVR Energy (NYSE: CVI), a company in which his hedge fund recently bought a 9.9% stake. Paulson thinks that CVR could be worth as much as $36.00 per share. On Thursday, the stock has climbed 0.63% to $30.54. While that may not seem like much, it is not bad considering that the broader stock market is getting blasted once again. Bill Ackman - The final speaker at Ira Sohn was the always interesting Bill Ackman. Attendees were likely sitting on the edge of their seats to hear what Ackman had to say about his largest holding, J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP). Earlier in the day, the stock had suffered its worst percentage loss ever on the back of a disastrous quarterly report. Although the market was closed by the time Ackman came up to speak, his hedge fund had lost hundreds of millions of dollars on its over-sized JCP position on Thursday as the stock finished down nearly 20%. While the exact amount of Pershing Square's losses on the position cannot be known, the fund held 38.7 million JCP shares as of its last 13-F filing. Given that JCP fell $6.57 during Thursday's trading session, the total damage done could have been in excess of $250 million. Ouch! In any event, Ackman didn't sound like he was thinking about unloading his stake at current prices, so maybe he isn't that worried. Ackman talked about the appointment of former Apple exec Ron Johnson as CEO of J.C. Penney. He said that he thinks Johnson thought JCP was the best turnaround story that he could participate in. He also praised the CEO's new ideas in transforming the brand by focusing less on promotional activity and coupons in favor of more straightforward pricing. Ackman added that JCP is a well-known brand and is not fundamentally broken. In fact, the noted investor thinks JCP could earn $6.00 per share by 2015 and that the stock could trade as high as $77.00 to $125.00. Ackman's efforts to defend J.C. Penney at Ira Sohn may have stemmed the losses in the stock in the very near-term. On Thursday, JCP shares are trading up marginally after rising more than 4% early in the session."
2012-05-17,Martin Marietta Fights Back at Einhorn,"David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital is not a popular man within the offices of Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM), after he slammed the company at the annual Ira Sohn Investment Conference, causing it to instantly tank 10%. It is currently trading down 8%. Recent earnings benefited from one time fiscal stimulus that is about to wind down, Einhorn said at the conference, obviously deciding that MLM is his new favorite company to short. The rumor earlier in the day had been that Einhorn was going to short Herbalife (NYSE: HLF), but that company's stock is surging 9% on Thursday. The scary thing for MLM is that Einhorn is rarely wrong. He famously shorted Lehman Brothers just prior to that bank's demise, and more recently he shorted Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ: GMCR). However, Martin Marietta responded to the comments directly to Benzinga, telling us that, Unlike companies targeted by shorts, Martin Marietta has come through a challenging period for the industry by carefully managing capital and making disciplined operational decisions. We are profitable and have a solid balance sheet, which will allow us to capitalize on positive industry trends and positions us well for the future. If there is a bright side for MLM following Einhorn's unfavorable comments, it is that the potential $6.7 billion hostile takeover of Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC) which seemed all but dead earlier in May, may now be back on. The takeover was on the ropes after a Delaware court ruling and VMC;s insistence in staying independent, but Einhorn's intervention has resulted in traders betting that the deal will eventually go through. Einhorn's comments, bad enough for MLM, will also reflect badly on VMC, the other company at the top of the pile for producing construction aggregates or crushed gravel and stone that's used to build roads and other infrastructure. Most analysts seem to agree that, while Einhorn has not really done Martin Marietta any favors, he has hardly caused disastrous results either and the only thing that has really changed is what the company will have to offer to eventually acquire Vulcan Materials. The end of Wednesday's trading saw a close-to-identical share drop for Martin Marietta and Vulcan Matrials, plus an end-of-day merger spread of under $1. Still, the fact that remains that before MLM look to move forward with any deal, it will need to address all concerns that have been raised. Follow me @BCallwood."

2012-05-20,Barron's Recap (5/19/12): Dalio's World and the Einhorn Effect,"This weekend in Barron's online: Hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio's thoughts on the troubles in Europe, the effect of comments made by David Einhorn, and the consequences of the Facebook IPO flop. Cover Story Ray Dalio's World by Sandra Ward. Ray Dalio, fabled hedge-fund manager, is the head of money-management firm Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge-fund firm and one of just a few to place more than one fund on Barron's annual Top 100 Hedge Funds ranking. He has described the deleveraging experience of the United States as beautiful for its balance of austerity, debt restructuring and quantitative easing. But, he says in the article, the situation in Europe is very different, more like the U.S. under the Articles of Confederation. And he sees a 30% chance in the next six months to two years for a really bad shock from Europe due to a lack of a centralized authority. See the article for how he thinks this will affect the U.S. and the global economy. Feature Stories In The Einhorn Effect Andrew Bary points out that when David Einhorn, the head of Greenlight Capital, made a bearish comment about Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM) at the annual Ira Sohn Investment Conference, shares of the company fell more than 10% in minutes. This effect is a consequence of presciently bearish calls Einhorn has made on such companies as Lehman Brothers, St. Joe (NYSE: JOE) and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ: GMCR). See the article for what top-performing hedge-fund managers at the conference liked and did not like. See also: Martin Marietta Fights Back at Einhorn Changing Their Stripes by Michael Santoli suggests that, with investors willing to pay for stocks that generate income, more companies are considering becoming real-estate investment trusts. Because they are unable to match the stock-market performance of REITs, companies in such industries as digital-transmission towers, data warehouses, private prisons and health care facilities are seeking to convert to REIT status. Andrew Bary's Facebook Flops: Look Out Below! suggests that If underwriters do not support Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), the stock could fall below its offering price. After all the hype and anticipation, the most anticipated tech IPO of all time fell flat on Friday, finishing just 0.6% higher. This prompted a sell-off Friday in social-networking stocks like Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA), Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN), and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD) and contributed to an afternoon decline in the major averages.

2013-05-21,CONSOL Energy and Other Energy Stocks Worth a Look Now,"In the wake of the first-quarter earnings season, analysts at Sterne Agee have issued a research report on the energy and industrials sectors. Their energy stock recommendations include CONSOL Energy (NYSE: CNX), Superior Energy Services (NYSE: SPN) and Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: WLL). Below is a quick look at how these three stocks have fared and what analysts expect from them. Note that from the industrials sector Sterne Agee recommended Fluor (NYSE: FLR), Greenbrier Companies (NYSE: GBX) and Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM). They also liked Boeing (NYSE: BA) and automakers Ford (NYSE: F) and General Motors (NYSE: GM). CONSOL Energy This coal and natural gas producer sports a market capitalization of about $8 billion and it is headquartered in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. The dividend yield is about 1.5 percent. The long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth forecast is about 12 percent, though the return on equity is less than eight percent. And note that the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is higher than the industry average. The short interest in CONSOL Energy was more than four percent of the float as of the April 30 settlement date. The number of shares sold short had been falling since the beginning of the year, until the 2.5 percent rise in the most recent period. But days to cover declined to less than four. Of the 26 analysts that follow the stock that were polled by Thomson/First Call, eight rate the stock at Strong Buy and 14 others also recommend buying shares. The mean price target, or where the analysts expect the share price to go, indicates more than 16 percent potential upside. Furthermore, the Sterne Agee target is about 41 percent higher than the current share price. The share price is about 13 percent higher than at the beginning of the year, but more than four percent lower than the 52-week high reached last fall. Over the past six months, the stock has outperformed competitors Alpha Natural Resources (NYSE: ANR), Arch Coal (NYSE: ACI) and Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU). Superior Energy Services This oilfield services provider has a market cap of more than $4 billion, but it offers no dividend. Its long-term EPS growth forecast is more than 18 percent, and the P/E ratio is less than the industry average. The operating margin is better than the industry average, but the return on equity is less than 10 percent. The short interest in this Houston-based company was less than two percent of the float at the end of April, after the number of shares sold short rose more than 10 percent in the previous two periods. The average daily volume in the most recent period was the second highest this year. All of the 18 analysts surveyed recommend buying shares, with seven of them rating the stock at Strong Buy. And the analysts think shares have some room to run, as their mean price target is more than 12 percent higher than the current share price. Sterne Agee's target indicates more than 15 percent upside, and would put shares in a neighborhood they have not seen since 2011. The share price hit a 52-week high this morning, and it is more than 32 percent higher year-to-date. Over the past six months, the stock has outperformed larger competitors Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI) and Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB), as well as the broader markets. Whiting Petroleum This independent oil and gas company is headquartered in Denver. It has a market cap near $5.5 billion, but it does not offer a dividend. The long-term EPS growth forecast is more than 10 percent. Whiting Petroleum's operating margin is higher than the industry average, and its return on equity is about 12 percent. The number of Whiting Petroleum shares sold short as of the most recent settlement date represented a bit more than three percent of the total float. That was highest level of short interest since last September, after a surge of about 19 percent in the most recent period. The days to cover was about two. Some 33 analysts were polled, and 11 of them rate the stock at Strong Buy. Another 16 also recommend buying shares. None of them recommends selling. Their mean price target suggests that the analysts on average see more than 22 percent upside potential. The Sterne Agee target is more than 24 percent higher than the current share price. The share price is up less than six percent since the beginning of the year. In fact, shares have traded mostly between $40 and $50 over the past year. The stock has underperformed Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) and Cabot Oil & Gas (NYSE: COG), as well as the broader markets, over the past six months."

2014-01-28,"Martin Marietta, Texas Industries Confirm $2.7B Deal to Merge","Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) and Texas Industries, Inc. (NYSE: TXI) today announced that the Boards of Directors of both companies have unanimously approved a definitive merger agreement under which Martin Marietta will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Texas Industries common stock in a tax-free, stock-for-stock transaction. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Texas Industries shareholders will receive 0.700 Martin Marietta shares for each share of Texas Industries common stock they own at closing. Based on the closing market prices for the shares of both companies on January 27, 2014, and their debt levels as of their most recently completed quarters, the combined company will have an enterprise value of approximately $8.5 billion. The combination will create a market leading supplier of aggregates and heavy building materials, with low-cost, vertically integrated aggregate and targeted cement operations. With greater geographic and product diversity and a leading distribution network, the combined company will have uniquely positioned assets across some of the nation's largest and fastest growing geographies, such as Texas and California. As market conditions improve, the combined company will be well-positioned for long-term growth, with a network in excess of 400 quarries, mines, distribution yards and plants spanning 36 states, Canada, the Bahamas and the Caribbean Islands. With a significant increase in scale and the potential to achieve substantial synergies, the combined company will seek to grow faster and more efficiently than either Martin Marietta or Texas Industries could on a standalone basis. Based on the closing stock price for Martin Marietta on January 27, 2014, this consideration would be equivalent to $71.95 of Martin Marietta stock for each Texas Industries share. The exchange ratio represents a 13 percent premium to the average exchange ratio implied by the closing prices of Martin Marietta's and Texas Industries' shares during the last 90 days, and an over 15 percent premium to the exchange ratio implied by the respective closing stock prices on December 12, 2013, the day prior to market speculation of a potential transaction. The transaction reflects an enterprise value of approximately $2.7 billion, including the assumption of $0.7 billion of Texas Industries' debt. Upon closing of the transaction, Martin Marietta shareholders are expected to own approximately 69 percent, and Texas Industries shareholders are expected to own approximately 31 percent, of the combined company. The companies expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to Martin Marietta's earnings per share in 2014, assuming refinancing of Texas Industries' outstanding debt at or around the closing of the merger and excluding one-time costs. Ward Nye, Martin Marietta's President and Chief Executive Officer said, “By uniting Martin Marietta's and Texas Industries' complementary assets and leveraging an expanded geographic footprint, we will be even better-positioned to deliver value to our shareholders and customers. Texas Industries' aggregates operations are strategically located in high growth markets and fit well into our existing portfolio, and its cement operations will further diversify our product and customer mix. Through the significant investments Texas Industries has made in plant modernization and capacity expansion, it has achieved leading positions in some of the nation's highest growth markets while maintaining a low cost profile. As a result of this combination, we will be poised to capitalize on the strength of our combined aggregates platform as well as the significant upside potential in the infrastructure, residential and nonresidential construction segments. We are confident that combining our companies will accelerate our ability to increase sales and cash flow and improve margins. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to quickly realizing the benefits of this transaction.” Mel Brekhus, Texas Industries' President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Combining with Martin Marietta represents a unique opportunity to create a more competitive company with a solid, diversified portfolio of assets, enhanced credit profile and a strong balance sheet. We are confident that we have found the right partner. This combination will advance our growth objectives, deliver significant value to all of our stakeholders, and allow shareholders to participate in the combined company's potential growth and value creation. In addition, we are pleased that, through this combination, our shareholders will enjoy a strong dividend distribution. This transaction will create a larger, stronger entity with enhanced career and professional development opportunities for employees. I look forward to working closely with Ward and the proven management teams of both companies to complete the transaction quickly and to ensure a smooth transition.” Strategic and Financial Benefits of Transaction * The Leader in the U.S. Aggregates Business: Martin Marietta will become the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates, supplying the crushed stone, sand and gravel used to build the roads, sidewalks and foundations on which Americans live. The addition of Texas Industries will add approximately 800 million tons of aggregates reserves, bringing the total to over 13.5 billion tons. Texas Industries shipped nearly 15 million tons of sand, gravel and crushed stone during fiscal year 2013. Texas Industries is a major supplier of aggregates in high-growth markets such as Texas, and has long-focused on the synergies available from operating in aggregates as well as cement and ready-mix. * Increased Scale, Enhanced Growth Exposure and Vertical Integration in Select Markets: With vertically integrated operations across aggregates and targeted cement, the combined company is expected to be even more competitive. Texas Industries increases Martin Marietta's presence in the Southwest, with state-of-the-art cement production facilities concentrated primarily in Texas and California – two of the largest and fastest growing markets for construction materials in the United States. The increased scale and geographic diversity resulting from this transaction will provide a broader set of opportunities for organic and inorganic growth. In addition, select vertical integration will improve distribution and transportation costs, diversify end-markets and drive other value enhancing efficiencies. The combined company will also have an outstanding asset base that can deliver superior product offerings and service to customers. * Significant Synergy Opportunities: The transaction is expected to generate approximately $70 million of annual pre-tax synergies by calendar year 2017, which would correspond to over $500 million total value creation for shareholders. Key drivers of these synergies include the consolidation of corporate overhead and duplicate functions, enhanced revenue opportunities and increased operational efficiencies through the adoption of best practices and capabilities from each company. * Incremental Value Creation through Utilization of NOLs and Potential Real Estate Divestitures: Martin Marietta expects to be able to utilize Texas Industries' more than $400 million in existing NOLs over the next few years. In addition, the companies believe that there is an opportunity to realize incremental value from the expected divestiture of identified non-operating real estate assets. * Financial Strength and Flexibility: The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Martin Marietta's earnings per share in 2014, assuming refinancing of Texas Industries' outstanding debt at or around the closing of the merger and excluding one-time costs. Martin Marietta expects that at the closing of the merger the combined company will maintain its strong existing credit ratings and have pro forma leverage of less than 3.0 times EBITDA for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. The combined company will continue to adhere to Martin Marietta's strict operational and financial discipline and, with improved access to capital, will be well-positioned to pursue a wide range of attractive growth opportunities to continue delivering value to shareholders. * Strong Balance Sheet with Solid Cash Flows and Meaningful Dividend: The combined company will maintain a strong balance sheet with significant cash flow, giving it the ability to pay a meaningful quarterly cash dividend. The combined company intends to maintain the dividend at Martin Marietta's current rate of $1.60 per Martin Marietta share annually, equivalent to $1.12 per Texas Industries share annually, based on the proposed exchange ratio. * Enhanced Value for Customers: The size and scale of the combined company will enable Martin Marietta to provide even more value for customers. With a collective workforce of approximately 7,000 highly-skilled employees and a shared commitment to providing exceptional construction materials and the best service and solutions, the combined company will be even better equipped to serve its customers and communities. * Greater Employee Opportunity: This combination creates an even stronger base of talent by uniting two highly-skilled workforces with a strong commitment to serving customers and communities. As part of a stronger, larger company, Martin Marietta and Texas Industries employees will benefit from greater career and professional development opportunities created by this transaction. Management, Board Composition and Headquarters After the close, the combined company, which will operate under the name Martin Marietta Materials, Inc., will be headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina and will maintain a significant presence in Dallas. Ward Nye and the rest of the Martin Marietta executive team will lead the combined company. Top talent across the combined organization will be retained based on a “best athlete” approach. An individual jointly selected by Martin Marietta and Texas Industries will be appointed to the Martin Marietta Board of Directors. Timeline and Approvals The companies anticipate closing the transaction in the second quarter of 2014. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals, including expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The transaction is also subject to the approval of Martin Marietta and Texas Industries shareholders. Texas Industries' two largest shareholders, representing approximately 51 percent of shares outstanding, have agreed to vote all of their shares (or in some limited circumstances, about 35 percent of the outstanding shares) of Texas Industries common stock in favor of the transaction."

2014-05-05,Can Vulcan Materials (VMC) Keep the Earnings Streak Alive? - Analyst Blog,"We expect Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2014 results on May 6. Last quarter, the company delivered an astounding positive earnings surprise of 333.33%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Vulcan Materials is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Positive Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +5.88%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. Zacks Rank: Vulcan Materials carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which, when combined with +5.88% ESP, makes us confident about a positive earnings beat. Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings? The construction aggregates producer's second-half 2013 revenues and profits increased significantly from the first half as improving private construction activity and better weather conditions markedly raised volumes in all its segments. Volumes improved 8% in the second half. Additionally, most of the volume and pricing increase was noted in the aggregates segment, which was sluggish in 2012 as well as in the first half of 2013. Strong volume and pricing growth coupled with aggressive cost control also significantly improved earnings and profitability in the second half. Management expects aggregates demand and volumes to increase in 2014 led by private construction projects, though uncertainty exists in public construction market. Strong growth potential in Vulcan's served markets (Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas) and the meaningful operating leverage that exists in the aggregates business are expected to drive earnings growth and cash generation in 2014 as volumes improve. Moreover, margins are expected to improve further in 2014 driven by volume and pricing growth as well as solid cost control and operating efficiencies from the profit enhancement initiatives. Other Stocks to Consider Other stocks in building/construction sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are: Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (NYSE: MLM), with Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Texas Industries Inc. (NYSE: TXI), with Earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). D.R. Horton, Inc.

2014-05-06,Fastenal Sales Soften in April - Analyst Blog,"Fastenal Company's (NASDAQ: FAST) April sales slowed versus March due to change in Easter timing. Nevertheless, sales were significantly better than last year indicating that the industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor's top line is turning around. April net sales rose 10% year over year to $315.1 million. Daily sales for the month grew 10.0% to $14.3 million, much better than April last year. However, daily sales in April were lower than 11.6% growth in March. Currency was a 0.5% headwind in the month. Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 8.5%, slightly better than 5.6% last year but down from 11.4% in Mar 2014. Daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 5.4%, better than 0.8 % in April last year. However, it was slower than 7.6% growth in March. After struggling for the past many quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in the first quarter of 2014. Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, up from 4.9% in the prior-year quarter, owing to increase in sales volume. Though the company witnessed softer sales in January and February due to harsh weather, sales improved in March. The double-digit growth in daily sales in March was driven by favorable timing of Easter and increased investments in stores that led to improvement in sales. The Easter holiday proved to be a headwind in April versus a benefit in March. Management also seems optimistic for top-line and incremental margin growth in future quarters as underlying markets improve, vending re-vamps, sales improvement efforts expand and comparisons remain easy throughout 2014. Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the building products/ construction/materials sector include Vulcan Materials Co. (NYSE: VMC), United Rentals Inc.

2014-07-01,"Martin Marietta, Texas Industries Merger Gets Shareholder Nod - Analyst Blog","Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) and Texas Industries, Inc. (NYSE: TXI) recently received approval for their proposed merger from majority of their shareholders. About 98% of Martin Marietta and 99% of Texas Industries shareholders have voted for the acquisition deal announced on Jan 28. Per the definitive merger deal, Martin Marietta will acquire all the outstanding shares of Texas Industries, a manufacturer of heavy construction materials in Southwestern U.S. Accordingly, Texas Industries will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Martin Marietta According to the agreement, Texas shareholders will receive 0.7 Martin Marietta shares against every Texas share they own. The companies have now got all required regulatory approvals for closing the acquisition. However, in order to close the deal, Martin Marietta must divest its North Troy aggregate quarry in Mill Creek, OK and its two rail yards sites in Dallas and Frisco, TX, as per the requirement of U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The waiting period related to the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 has been terminated. With the approval from shareholders, the transaction is expected to be closed promptly. Headquartered in Raleigh, NC, the combined company will have an enterprise value of $8.5 billion and will be headed by Ward Nye and the Martin Marietta executive team. With the completion of the acquisition, Martin Marietta is expected to become the largest producer of construction aggregates and heavy building materials, which includes crushed stone, sand and gravel. Texas Industries will strengthen Martin Marietta's aggregate reserves and access to high end markets such as Texas. The merger will also result in vertical integration across aggregates and targeted cement, which will increase productivity and scale of production. The combined company will benefit from an increase in geographic diversity and combined access to a larger market. Martin Marietta Materials carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Investors interested in the building construction/building products sector can consider stocks like Gafisa S.A. (NYSE: GFA) and TRI Pointe Homes, Inc. (NYSE: TPH).

2014-07-15,"Vulcan Materials Hires New CEO, Hikes Dividend Again ","The board of directors at Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) recently announced the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer (NYSE: CEO). Also, the largest producer of construction aggregates in the U.S. announced a quarterly dividend on Friday — the second increase this year. On Monday, Vulcan Materials announced the appointment of J. Thomas Hill, 55, as President and CEO of the company. Hill, who served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Vulcan Materials, replaces Donald James, 65. Last week, the company announced that it will pay a quarterly dividend of 6 cents per share in Sep 2014, versus 5 cents paid in May. The quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual dividend of 24 cents per share, yielding 0.4% annually. The increased quarterly dividend will be payable on Sep 10, 2014, to shareholders of record as on Aug 27. Earlier in February, Vulcan Materials increased the quarterly dividend by 400% from 1 cent to 5 cents. We believe Vulcan Materials' improved liquidity position following the sale of non-core cement and concrete businesses in Florida, reduction in debt and improved earnings from the Profit Enhancement Plan are responsible for the back-to-back dividend increases. Under the Profit Enhancement Plan, Vulcan Materials divested non-core assets, improved earnings and cash flows, paid off debts and thereby strengthened its overall credit profile. With the sale of non-core cement and concrete businesses in Florida to Cementos Argo for $720 million in March, the company achieved the goals laid down under the plan. These initiatives implemented over the past two years have increased adjusted EBITDA by $116 million, generated more than $1 billion from the sale of non-strategic assets and future sales production agreements and reduced total debt of approximately $800 million. Other Stocks to Consider Vulcan Materials carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other stocks in the building construction/materials sector worth considering include Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (NYSE: MLM), D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE: DHI) and Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE: TOL). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2014-07-22,Is Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) Likely to Beat Earnings Estimates? ,"We expect Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), the mining and equipment behemoth, to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2014 results before the market opens on Jul 24. Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Caterpillar may beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components. Positive Zacks ESP: Caterpillar currently has an Earnings ESP of +2.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.53 per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.50. Zacks Rank #2 (Buy): Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 and 3 have a higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. The combination of Caterpillar's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Earnings ESP of +2.00% makes us confident of a positive earnings beat. What is Driving Better-than-Expected Earnings? Caterpillar's estimates have undergone positive revisions following its first-quarter earnings results. Caterpillar's first-quarter earnings increased 22% to $1.61 per share as the company's incessant efforts to cut down costs helped mitigate the effect of lower mining-related sales on its profits. Caterpillar reported a backlog of $19.3 billion at the end of the first quarter, up 7% year over year, driven by improvement in Energy & Transportation, mainly locomotives. This marks a reversal from the decline in backlog reported earlier. Second quarter machinery results are expected to reflect the improving macroeconomic environment. Both North American truck and North American energy markets are showing signs of improvement while a gradual recovery in the global construction market is also expected to aid improvement of results. Caterpillar has initiated extensive cost-saving programs across its global businesses and will continue to benefit from additional restructuring actions in 2014 to optimize its cost structure and improve its operational efficiency. Caterpillar has topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4.82%. In the last reported quarter, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 28.80%. Other Stocks to Consider Caterpillar is not the only company which is looking up this earnings season. The following companies are also likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter: Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (NYSE: MLM) with an Earnings ESP of +2.44% holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE: ETN) has an Earnings ESP of +2.38% and a Zacks Rank #2. Kennametal Inc. (NYSE: KMT) has an Earnings ESP of +1.12% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

As Demand Recovery Can Propel Shares Up","In a report published Thursday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners initiated coverage on Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM) with a Buy rating and $136.00 price target. In the report, Bank of America noted, “We initiate on Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) with a Buy rating and a $136/shr price objective, reflecting a positive view on the growth outlook for key nonresidential construction demand. We expect favorable attributes of protected, local aggregate oligopolies to continue, and incremental margins should be robust as volumes rise. While TXI's contribution seems baked in after a sharp ytd rise in the share price, we also expect better cement conditions to benefit the combined entity. Our integrated earnings model includes synergies from the deal, NOLs, and TXI debt refinancing. MLM's fast-growing geographies and its long-haul transportation system are positive, but integrating TXI could be a headwind in the short term.” Martin Marietta Materials closed on Wednesday at $118.69."

2015-03-12,Could Summit Materials Put The IPO Market Back On The Road?,"The First Leveraged Buyout Of 2015 Hits The Public Markets Amid a quiet IPO market in the first quarter of 2015, attention this week shifts to Blackstone-backed construction materials company Summit Materials (NYSE: SUM). As the old cliché goes timing is everything, and with the construction business on the rebound, now may be the perfect time for the conglomerate. The company, based in Denver, CO, went public this Thursday. The stock opened at $20.16 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares have since risen slightly higher, and are up more than 12 percent on the day. Summit Materials, formed by Blackstone in 2009, is a group of building material assets. Its strategy is to acquire and grow building companies in the aggregates, ready-mix concretes, cement, asphalt paving, and construction industries. It has since acquired 34 companies and consolidated the group into 11 companies within its portfolio. Related Link: Don't Miss What Lumber Liquidators Said This Morning Summit established itself as a top 10 U.S. supplier of aggregates by volume in the residential, commercial, and public construction markets. With the housing market rebounding, building materials like stone and gravel present an opportunity for investment. A recent February 2015 Barron's article featured competitor Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC). The article mentioned the improvement in the housing market and the company saw a rise in demand as the company experienced a 15 percent jump year over year in 4th quarter shipments. High Growth Comes with High Costs As one of the fastest growing construction materials companies in the country, revenue increased 197 percent since December 2010 to December 2014 compared with average revenue increase of 38 percent from competitors. Summit's revenue in the last 12 months was $1.2 billion versus December 2013 revenue of $916 million. A contributor to Summit's revenue growth is the company's aggressive acquisition strategy, with deals being funded through equity commitments and debt financing. These buys have added to the company's debt of $1.06 billion. The company has still yet to make a profit. Net income as of December 2014 was a net loss $6.28 million which is a major improvement compared to previous net losses of $104 million in December 2013. EBITDA margin is 13 percent and poised to continue upward with the rebound in the construction market. Summit employs 4,500 people across the nation, doing business in 17 states with a major focus on Texas, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Utah. The company effectively utilizes vertical integration to supply its customers with heavy-side construction materials and related products. Private Equity Backing Summit was initially started with the backing of private equity and investment firms The Blackstone Group and Silverhawk Capital Partners. Blackstone will still own up to 75 percent majority of the company and closely linked to the firm's interest. The typical private equity route is to hold the firm's assets until it can exit out at a profit. Investors should look for signs when the company begins selling off its stakes -- most likely when Summit starts consistently turning a profit. It could be sooner than later with data from the National Association of Home Builders noting housing starts are estimated to grow by 57 percent between 2013 and 2016. At the same time, nonresidential private construction is expected to rise by 26 percent. With public infrastructure aging, Summit feels they can support its business long-term. The firm's large presence should be a contributing factor in its ability to win business in future profitable projects. Competitors such as Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM) and Vulcan Materials Company (mentioned above) have performed well lately. Advanced Draining System which was the most recent construction supply company IPO traded up 74 percent since its July 2014 debut. Conclusion and Pricing Info The company appears to have a strong growth strategy that serves major markets on the rebound with an experienced management team. If current trends continue, it could further boost profits and expand its market share going forward. The debt level is a little worrisome. Summit plans to use of the proceeds to pay down debt, but if the company raises around $400 million, there will still be plenty of debt left. Investors should monitor the company over the coming quarters. As always, investors should consider their risks and objectives before making any decision to purchase an IPO. The offering included underwriters Citigroup, Goldman, Sachs, & Co., BofA Merrill Lynch, and Barclays.

2015-06-08,"Freeport-McMoRan, Glu Mobile And Others Insiders Have Been Buying","With the markets still near all-time highs after a long bull run, investors have had to get more selective when it comes to stocks. As Barron's recently pointed out, insider buying can be an encouraging signal. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and beneficial owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Recently, the most significant insider buys have been of the likes of American Homes 4 Rent, Freeport-McMoRan and Glu Mobile. American Homes 4 Rent One director has been buying up shares since March. So far in June that director bought almost 815,000 American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE: AMH) shares at prices ranging from $16.77 to $16.87. That came to more $13.72 million. The total stake is now more than 3 million shares. This Malibu-based real estate investment trust has a market capitalization near $3.5 billion and a dividend yield of about 1.2 percent. Strong revenue growth is predicted for the current quarter and the full year, but note that the return on equity is in the red. Shares ended last week at $16.48. See also: Will Jorge Paulo Lemann Buy Diageo? Shares Rocket On Rumor Associated Banc-Corp The CEO, CFO, other executives and two directors accumulated a total of more than 53,000 shares of this Green Bay, Wisconsin-based bank holding company last week. At $25.00 per share, that was worth $1.34 million. This was in the wake of the resolution to a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development investigation. The market cap of Associated Banc Corp (NYSE: ASB) is around $3 billion, and the dividend yield is about 2.1 percent. The operating margin is greater than the industry average. The share price hit a multiyear high on Friday and closed at $19.75. Freeport-McMoRan As copper prices retreated from year-to-date highs in May, and with the share price pulling back as well, the vice chairman of the board purchased 60,000 Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX) at $20.52 apiece. Last week's transaction cost him around $1.23 million. This Phoenix, Arizona-based natural resource company has a market cap of more than $20 billion and a dividend yield near 1.0 percent. Here too the return on equity is in the red, but the long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth forecast is about 12 percent. Shares ended Friday's trading session at $19.65. Glu Mobile Tencent Holdings acquired 8.5 million shares of Glu Mobile Inc. (NASDAQ: GLUU), bringing its total stake to 21 million shares, in accordance with a previously announced investment plan. Last week's purchase totaled $51 million, at $6.00 per share. Glu Mobile's market cap is around $810 million. The long-term EPS growth forecast of this San Francisco-based game maker is less than 5 percent, but the operating margin is greater than the industry average. The stock closed Friday at $6.71, so a well-timed by by Tencent. Martin Marietta One Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) director recently bought more than 31,000 shares. At prices ranging from $150.16 to $151.45 per share, that came to more than $4.69 million. The transactions came as shares backed off of a recent multiyear high. This $10 billion market cap construction materials company has a long-term EPS growth forecast of about 11 percent and a dividend yield of about 1.1 percent. Continuing the recent slide, shares closed at $148.10 on Friday. The stock is up more than 34 percent since the beginning of the year. See also: Electric Dump Trucks? Tesla Co-Founder Says Yes Tutor Perini The chairman and CEO has purchased more than 133,000 shares of Tutor Perini Corp (NYSE: TPC) at prices ranging from $20.94 to 22.61. That cost him more than $2.32 million. The transactions followed the annual shareholders meeting. This diversified general contractor has a market cap of a little over $1 billion. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is higher than the industry average, and the long-term EPS growth forecast is about 12 percent. Shares were changing hands at $22.88 on Friday's close, after rising more than 10 percent last week. At the time of this writing, the author had no position in the mentioned equities."
2015-08-05,Calls Of Note: The Street's Research Moving Stocks This Wednesday,"The following represents a hand-picked selection of notable research curated by an analyst known in some circles as The Sith Overlord Of The Street. Bank Of America: Downgrading Vishay To Underperform Ruplu Bhattacharya of Bank of America downgraded shares of Vishay Intertechnology (NYSE: VSH) to Underperform from Buy with a price target slashed to $8.50 from a previous $14 following the company's weaker than expected second-quarter print. Looking forward, Bhattacharya expressed concern that an Automotive (25 percent of revenue) slowdown, particularly in China, may affect the company's exports. At the same time, the Industrial end market (36 percent of revenue) is expected to be weak in Asia, as well as some sectors in the United States such as oil and gas. Related Link: Calls Of Note: The Street's Research Moving Stocks This Monday Bank Of America: Martin Marietta's ‘Strong' Outlook In Focus Timna Tanners of Bank of America maintained a Buy rating on shares of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) with a price target raised to $184 from a previous $162 after the company reported a Q2 EPS miss in a weather-stricken quarter. Tanners cited management's comments that attributed weather issues, which negatively impacted its gross profit by $40 million, but expects the recovery of lost shipments could last through 2016 amid strong demand. Moreover, the company remains confident in an economic recovery (even in energy-rich Texas), while prices rose across all products and regions. JPMorgan: Downgrading HubSpot Mark Murphy of JPMorgan downgraded shares of HubSpot Inc (NYSE: HUBS) to Neutral from Overweight with an unchanged $45 price target following the stock's 58 percent year-to-date gain. Murphy noted that shares recently traded above his $45 price target and imply a 9.1x EV/CY16E revenue, which is a fair premium to the group average of 6.5x given the company's superior growth trajectory. Susquehanna: Upgrading Advanced Energy Industries Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna Financial Group upgraded shares of Advanced Energy Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: AEIS) with a price target boosted to $35 from a previous $22. Hosseini noted an upgraded rating is justified due to: 1) continued execution in divesting the Solar Inverter business 2) diversifying into Industrial and scaling the Services business 3) increasing its total addressable market as 3D NAND capacity increases. Oppenheimer: ‘We Love' Skyworks At $89 Rick Schafer of Oppenheimer commented that Skyworks Solutions Inc (NASDAQ: SWKS) (Outperform, $120 price target) continues to enjoy content gains with its top customer (Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)). The analyst estimated the company saw a 20 to 25 percent content increase in the iPhone 6 versus the iPhone 5, with a further 15 to 20 percent content jump in the upcoming iPhone refresh. Schafer added that Skyworks remains ideally positioned to see future growth, and the recent pullback offers an opportunity for long-term investors. Related Link: Cantor Upgrades Coach, View Now In Line With Most Of Wall Street Wunderlich: Upgrading Chuy's Holdings Robert Derrington of Wunderlich upgraded shares of Chuy's Holdings Inc (NASDAQ: CHUY) to Buy from Hold with a price target raised to $34 from a previous $24 following the company's strong second-quarter print and boosted 2015 earnings per share guidance. Derrington noted the company raised its 2015 earnings per share guidance to a range of $0.82 to $0.85 from a previous $0.76 to $0.79. The revised guidance reflects the company's strong second quarter and further gains to come. Citi: Street Estimates For Microsoft ‘Still Look Too High' Walter Pritchard of Citigroup commented on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT)'s (Sell, $38 price target) fourth-quarter expectations, noting that his estimates range 6 to 10 percent below the Street's expectations. Pritchard questioned why the Street's estimates are based on an incremental confidence in Windows. At the same time, foreign exchange rates are expected to have a dampening impact on Commercial revenue. The analyst suggested that the market currently prices in the most optimistic scenarios for Microsoft shares, something that we've seen consistently over the past year despite estimates being continually cut. Citi: Upgrading Kellogg To Buy David Driscoll of Citigroup upgraded shares of Kellogg Company (NYSE: K) to Buy from Neutral with a price target raised to $80 from a previous $66 given a renewed confidence in the company's ability to return to growth in 2016 and beyond. According to Driscoll's calculations, Kellogg only needs to increase its 2016 earnings per share by 30 cents year-over-year to meet its high-single-digit, long-term earnings per share growth target. The company can boost its earnings per share next year through Project K savings ($0.20 EPS gain) combined with solid zero-based budgeting benefits (another $0.20 EPS gain). Evercore: Upgrading Hilton, Marriott Rich Hightower, Evercore ISI, upgraded shares of Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc (NYSE: HLT) to Buy from Hold with a price target raised to $31 from a previous $30. The analyst also upgraded shares of Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ: MAR) to Buy from Hold with a price target raised to $91 from a previous $85. According to Hightower, a continuation of solid fundamentals, global unit growth and attractive valuations justify a Buy rating. In Hilton's case, the analyst noted balance sheet delivering, the initiation of a dividend and potential structural catalysts related to the timeshare and owned real estate segments. Hightower continued that Marriott's operating strength and free cash flow potential remains and the stock is attractive given its asset-light business model. Deutsche Bank: Downgrading Hyatt Carlo Santarelli of Deutsche Bank downgraded shares of Hyatt Hotels Corporation (NYSE: H) to Hold from Buy with a price target lowered to $62 from a previous $66 given a lack of meaningful positive catalysts. According to Santarelli, Hyatt's risk-to-reward profile is no longer overly favorable, and the name lacks catalysts that will allow the stock to outperform its peers given its chain scale, geographic exposures and relative fee and unit growth. Evercore: Upgrading J C Penney Finally, Matt McGinley of Evercore ISI upgraded shares of J C Penney Company Inc (NYSE: JCP) to Hold from Sell with no assigned price target, as the company continues to make progress in merchandising. However, the analyst cautioned the company is not out of the woods, as it faces continued challenges in recovering sales, margin, free cash flow and, most importantly, in terms of profit and competition. Nevertheless, the company is putting up a good fight and a Sell rating is no longer warranted. Image Credit: Public Domain"

2015-09-15,The 'Great Debate' Happening In Construction Right Now,"U.S. construction activity is still in the middle innings of its cycle, according to Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Investor concerns around the segment are misplaced. Shares of United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) and Summit Materials Inc (NYSE: SUM) remain positive rated. In a report published Monday, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Ted Grace noted that three-plus years into the housing/construction recovery, the segment continues to see solid cyclical growth within the $360 billion private, non-residential construction market and the broader $1 trillion U.S. total construction sector. Construction Momentum Continuing Grace continued by highlighting several data points to support his view of continued momentum in construction. Specifically, the analyst pointed out the acceleration of non-seasonally adjusted growth over the past few months and the breadth of improvement across key sub-verticals (e.g., lodging, power, manufacturing, amusement and recreation). Related Link: Building Something With This Construction ETF In fact, Grace estimated that 2015 real private non-residential construction will have rebounded by 25 percent off its 2011 trough with total construction up 15 percent over the same period. However, non-residential construction will remain approximately 30 percent below its 2008 peak, even as the U.S. economy has grown approximately 20 percent since then. Most importantly, however, based on a variety of metrics, we believe the current cycle has legs beyond the horizon of our bottomsup [sic.] forecast (that extends only to 2016), Grace wrote. In a cyclical world where the 'macro' most often trumps the 'micro', we view this as favorable for Positive-rated United Rentals, Vulcan Materials, Martin Marietta Materials and Summit Materials. Per Capita Forecast Finally, Grace pointed out that he is forecasting a per capita spending of $1,130, which exceeds both the 10- and 20-year average of $1,200 and $1,300, respectively. Nevertheless, this also falls 33 percent below the 2008 peak per capital consumption of $1,710. Looking Ahead Bottom line, the analyst concluded that his non-residential construction forecasts are suggestive of nothing more aggressive than mid-cycle and well below any semblance of peak.

2015-10-02,Longbow Research Buying Matin Marietta On Pullback; Upgrades Stock,"Shares of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) have risen almost 42 percent year-to-date, reaching a high of $176.51 on September 16. Garik Shmois of Longbow Research has upgraded the company to Buy, with a price target of $188. With the pullback in the stock from its recent highs, Shmois believes that the share offer an attractive entry point. “While we appreciate recent concerns regarding the nonresidential recovery as well as disappointing Texas cement volume data in August, we have confidence in the much more critical aggregates cycle as driving earnings growth,” Schmois explained. Schmois expressed optimism regarding Martin Marietta Materials’ geographic mix in the Southwest, which is expected to drive incremental margins for the company. “MLM’s business mix is actually defensive when considering no aggregates import threats and its pure US exposure,” the Longbow Research report stated. Schmois also believes that the concerns regarding “the demise of Texas cement” have been overdone, given its limited impact on the company’s EBITDA. Investor sentiment is expected to “turn again around earnings season – per usual.” In addition, the continuing strong free cash flow generation offers the company opportunities for buybacks and additional M&A. The 3Q15, FY15, FY16 and FY17 EBITDA estimates have been marginally lowered “to account for a more conservative run rate in cement.”"

2016-03-07,Should Investors Root For Trump Or Clinton? Go With The 'Devil You Know',"The cover story in this weekend's Barron's makes a case for Hillary Clinton as a better president for investors. Barron's is not endorsing Clinton so much as selecting the devil you know. Other featured articles include a special report on America's top 1,200 financial advisors. Which of the two front-runner presidential candidates will be better for investors, asks this week's cover story in Barron's. And how likely is it that Republicans will hold their noses and vote for Hillary in 2016? Trump or Clinton: Who's Better for Investors? by John Kimelman suggests that Trump's giant tax cuts would balloon the federal deficit, while his plan for tariffs on China could plunge the world into recession. But Clinton has called out Wall Street for wrecking Main Street during the financial crisis, and her desire to raise taxes on short-term capital gains isn't exactly good news for investors. In the wake of last week's Super Tuesday results, Barron's has sized up each candidate's positions on taxes, spending, trade and other issues that directly affect markets. And Barron's take is that Clinton seems better suited to help the markets than the Republican front-runner. Hillary would be fairly predictable, and markets like predictability, says a strategist quoted in the article. She is a bit more moderate than Obama, and despite all the concerns that she would repeat the Obama agenda, she would be more willing to compromise. Barron's makes it clear that it is neither endorsing Hillary Clinton for president of the United States nor is it saying that she would be the best possible president for investors. But it sees professional investors considering her because the devil you know is better than the one you don't know. The article includes a side-by-side look at how the two candidates stand on individual and corporate income taxes, on capital gains and the estates tax, as well as on trade.

2016-03-16,Bank Of America: Steel Dynamics A Better Bet Than U.S. Steel,"In a recent industry overview, Bank of America Merrill Lynch looked into the U.S. steel industry against the backdrop of the U.S. Commerce Department's preliminary dumping tariff decision. The document outlined tariffs on HRC imports (hot rolled coil imports) prohibitive as follows: Australia: 23 percent Brazil: 34 percent Japan: 6–11 percent Korea: 4–7 percent Turkey: 5–7 percent The UK: 49 percent Bank of America considers anything below 10 percent less prohibitive, depending on the U.S. price premium to other countries. What It Means While the final decision is not slated until August 3, the tariff decisions have been in the works since August 2015. In regards to what the tariff means and what the decisions imply, Bank of America explained, As a result of the expected tariff decision, imports slowed into year-end 2015. Related Link: Credit Suisse Bullish On Steel Sector These declines in addition to mill curtailments and seasonal demand have contributed to a tighter market. Import volumes already fell on the back of the investigations, yet we would expect some further net declines as Brazil and Australian imports fall, even as Turkish and Japanese tons perhaps rise, said Bank of America. For the near term, Bank of America anticipates relative strength, but questions its sustainability. We recently got more conviction on sheet price upward momentum after channel checks this week suggested markets have gotten tighter, the firm said. While rising prices can invite more imports and capacity to restart, we see a delay before any incremental tons can affect the market. Through May U.S. domestic prices may continue to rise, after which upward momentum could be challenged by seasonally slower demand, restarts, and or/higher imports. A Few Names The industry note highlighted Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) specifically, indicating a 12-month price objective of $23 per share and justified given the greater cash flow outlook ahead, more diversified geographic/end market mix, and potential Columbus deal-related synergies. Bank of America currently has a Buy rating on Steel Dynamics. Other Buy-rated names in the space include: Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (NASDAQ: KALU) Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

2016-03-28,"Goldman On Industrials: Continues To Prefer Construction Products Over E&C, Machinery","Goldman Sachs raised its coverage view on Engineering & Construction (E&C) to Neutral from Cautious as non-OPEC supply reductions provide visibility on an oil price recovery through 2017 and risk of E&C multiple expansion. Moreover, Goldman continues to prefer Construction Products (Attractive) to E&C (now Neutral) and Machinery (Cautious). Our Cautious view on E&C was based on an extended capital allocation shift for commodity producing companies and countries from infrastructure investment to balance sheet repair, analysts, including Jerry Revich, wrote in a note. Goldman said since lowering its E&C view in late 2014, energy capex estimates have been reduced by 46 percent, mining capex by 38 percent and consensus EPS by 26 percent. Related Link: A Muddled Outlook For Industrial ETFs Now, based on non-OPEC supply reductions, the brokerage estimates an oil price recovery to $57 in 2017 that could drive multiple expansion for the group. The analysts expect the capex recovery to be concentrated in U.S. shale – where E&Cs have limited exposure ex-LNG. On Machinery, Goldman sees an emerging construction recovery in Europe, China and U.S. (public). According to the note, Our Buys are focused on product cycle opportunities (Trimble Navigation Limited (NASDAQ: TRMB), WABCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE: WBC)), rising cash returns (Allison Transmission Holdings Inc (NYSE:ALSN), PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ: PCAR)), and European truck exposure (Paccar, Wabco). However, for mining & construction machinery, the analysts believe excess global mine and U.S. pipeline supply will make earnings growth in 2017 challenging, underpinning their Cautious view and Sell ratings on Joy Global Inc. (NYSE: JOY) and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT). Meanwhile, Goldman reiterated its Attractive coverage view on Construction Products, and expects first quarter earnings to reveal accelerating aggregates pricing momentum due to the carryover effect of mid to late 2015 pricing actions, and rising visibility on the public construction cycle. In addition, a structurally repriced markets following a sustained M&A cycle will also benefit the sector. Our top picks remain Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM), Summit Materials Inc (NYSE: SUM), analysts added."
2016-04-25,Goldman Upgrades Machinery Sector From Cautious To Neutral,"A recovery in Chinese construction demand has led Goldman Sachs to upgrade Joy Global Inc. (NYSE: JOY) and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) to Neutral from Sell, while upgrading the broad machinery sector to Neutral from Cautious. Joy Analyst Jerry Revich is concerned about Joy's exposure to high-cost mining regions longer-term, but sees potential for a capex recovery if the Chinese construction recovery continues. We estimate 70 percent upside to new equipment capex if spot commodity prices are sustained, Revich concluded. The analyst raised his 2017–18 EPS estimates to $0.34/$0.38 from $-0.37/$-0.50, driven primarily by higher new equipment sales forecasts. Related Link: Jefferies Looking For Green Shoots In Machinery Stocks: What That Means We estimate $1.50 as mid-cycle EPS. Our estimate is based on new equipment sales of $1.2 billion – equivalent to 2014 levels and 100 percent above 2016E sales; and aftermarket sales of $2.0 billion – in-line with 2017E and 36 percent below 2012 peak, Revich said. The analyst, who raised Joy's price target to $24 from $13, noted stabilization in total mining capex budgets could be enough to drive normalization in equipment demand. However, long term, Revich continues to see market share risk for North American coal and iron ore due to significantly higher ore grades – and as a result lower costs – in Australia and South America. According to the analyst, Joy derives 16 percent of sales from Australia compared to Australia's over 40 percent share of seaborne iron ore and met coal markets. Caterpillar On Caterpillar, Revich said a sustained China construction recovery has increased iron ore spot 20 percent higher since February, and could contribute to a recovery in machinery share of mining capex. Our Sell rating on CAT was based on our view of an extended downturn in US pipeline, global mining, and construction capex for commodity export countries. We cited improved commodity supply-demand balance and a weakening US$ as key risks to our call, which have played out as we did not anticipate a sustained China construction recovery, Revich noted. The analyst, who expects mid-cycle resources sales of $7.1 billion compared to $5.9 billion in 2016E, said, Incremental sales could come at 40 percent incremental margins. Revich raised his price target on the stock to $78 from $62. However, he remains concerned about the gas compression capex cycle and still expects the pace of U.S. pipeline capacity additions to slow, with a 45 percent decline in growth capex in 2017 compared to 2015 levels. We see a $300 million headwind in 2017 vs. 2016 EBIT, net of the impact of CAT's service business, Revich noted. Related Link: Caterpillar CEO: We're Near Bottom Broad Analysis On the sector, the analyst sees potential for mining equipment share of capex to return to historical average, implying a doubling in new equipment sales off 2016 levels. Revich also highlighted that the construction machinery demand in commodity export countries could improve if the current commodity recovery is sustained. While capex/FCF is above the historical average, we note that if spot prices hold, earnings power for the major global miners would improve by 80 percent – a scenario that would take capital allocation toward capex to historical lows. That said, the analyst is not positive on the sector due to oversupply of Machinery in many regions of the world with pockets of pricing pressure. A Few Favorites Revich's top picks in the sector include Trimble Navigation Limited (NASDAQ: TRMB), WABCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE: WBC), Allison Transmission Holdings Inc (NYSE: ALSN) and PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ: PCAR). In addition, Goldman still prefers construction productsover machinery and E&C, with Buy ratings on Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) and Summit Materials Inc (NYSE: SUM). Shares of Caterpillar fell 2.36 percent to $76.48, and Joy Global dropped 2.09 percent to $20.14."

Analyst Timna Tanners is calling for HRC prices to peak at $600/t in Q3 before pulling back in Q4. “Sheet market strength has been driven by supply constraints, as trade cases and higher Q1 Asian prices reduced import offers and AKS and X have each kept blast furnaces idle,” Tanners explained. Related Link: Global Fossil Fuel Electricity Demand Will Peak In 2025 In addition to upping its steel price outlook, Bank of America has also upgraded United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) from Underperform to Neutral due in part to its recent balance sheet improvements.

2016-10-11,Goldman Sachs Downgrades Trio Of Construction Product Stocks,"Goldman in a research note released on Monday raised its machinery coverage view to Attractive but lowered its construction products coverage to Neutral. Noting that the construction spending in the United States has increased 28 percent since it turned positive on the U.S. construction cycle in 2013, the firm said it continues to be positive on a continued construction recovery. However, analyst Jerry Revich noted that the pace of recovery is slowing. Specifically, the analyst sees rising risk in the private non-residential vertical, where greenfield chemicals and LNG investment is at peak. Accordingly, the analyst downgraded three construction products stocks, namely KBR, Inc.(NYSE: KBR), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) and Summit Materials Inc (NYSE: SUM). Goldman, however, believes that the machinery end-markets are bottoming. The firm is of the view that manufacturing restructuring is likely to drive structurally higher margins for Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), Cummins Inc. (NYSE: CMI), Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) and Terex Corporation (NYSE: TEX). Related Link: Goldman Upgrades Caterpillar, Cummins To Buy; Adds Cummins To Conviction Buy List Limited Growth Prospects For KBR Goldman downgraded KBR to Sell, citing its limited growth prospects. The firm believes the company will be challenged to grow earnings due to its heavy exposure to core LNG and greenfield ammonia capex cycles, which contribute 35 to 40 percent of EBIT. These, according to the firm, are in early stages of decline. Downgrading Martin Marietta, Summit Materials On Slowing Growth Goldman downgraded Martin Marietta Materials and Summit Materials Inc to Neutral, as it sees a slowdown in growth in the fourth year of the construction recovery amid broadly positive investor sentiment. The firm's lowered opinion on Martin Marietta stems from the fact that the private non-residential construction recovery has played out and public construction recovery is progressing at a slower pace than expected, especially in Texas. Goldman lowered its price target on the firm to $202 from $210, premising the action on reduction to its mid-cycle EV/EBITDA multiple to 10 times from 10.3 times previously. Meanwhile, on Summit Materials, Goldman noted that the company, though executing on acquisition integration, has seen its organic growth challenged. The firm lowered its price target om the firm to $21 from $22. Caterpillar To Have $8 In Mid-Cycle Earnings Goldman upgraded Caterpillar to Buy, as it sees $8 in mid-cycle earnings driven by manufacturing footprint reductions in Europe construction industries, Resources product and manufacturing consolidation and a recovery in reciprocating engine demand in energy & transportation. The firm sees the company benefiting from an eventual normalization in mining equipment share of capex budgets. Additionally, the firm sees scope for further SG&A and R&D cost reductions following tier 4 product cycle. Goldman raised its 12-month price target on the shares of the company to $112 from $76. Power Systems Consolidation, Operating Leverage To Benefit Cummins Goldman sees upside to the Cummins' mid-cycle earnings estimates, driven by power systems operational consolidation and operating leverage, as it expects U.S. truck capex to improve in 2018 off a 2017 trough. As such, Goldman upgraded the shares of the company to Buy from Neutral and raised its price target to $162 from $134. Lower Tier-4 Transition Costs To Drive Margins Of Deere Goldman noted that Deere's third-quarter results confirm its view that structurally higher mid-cycle margins are near the trough. The firm also noted that the company was able to deliver 160 basis points of margin improvement in the ag &turf business despite lower sales. The firm expects the lower tier-4 product transition costs that drove outperformance in the third quarter to drive upside to margin estimates in the coming quarters. At Last Check ...

2016-10-14,Jim Cramer Gives His Opinion On Granite Construction,"On CNBC's Mad Money, Jim Cramer said that Granite Construction Inc. (NYSE: GVA) is too volatile for him. He believes this is the wrong moment to bet on the U.S. government investments in the infrastructure. He has liked Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC). These companies make aggregates that are needed for highways and their stocks are performing poorly, so he would be very careful when it comes to the thesis of the Government investments in infrastructure."
2016-10-27,Trump Or Clinton: Who Would Create More Jobs?,"Although Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are very different presidential candidates with extremely dissimilar policy platforms, they seem to agree on two issues: eliminating drug price gouging and creating new jobs. And this makes sense. According to a recent Gallup poll 88 percent of Democrats (and Democrat-leaning voters), and 80 percent of Republicans (and Republican-leaners) believe “employment and jobs” are “extremely important” or “very important” topics. The Options Clinton has outlined a 100-Days Jobs Plan, which she has described as “the biggest investment in new good-paying jobs since World War II.” Moody’s Analytics Chief Economist Mark Zandi estimated this strategy would result in the creation of 10.4 million jobs in four years. However, it should be noted that, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. economy should create about 7.1 million jobs by 2026, assuming it follows the current trajectory. Trump, for his part, has promised to create 25 million jobs over a 10-year span. However, when Moody’s looked into his plan, it arrived at the conclusion that, instead of creating new jobs, the proposal would result in the loss of 3.4 million jobs. Is Your Job Safe? As uncertainty regarding the jobs market mounts, Mic decided to “[shake] the the trees of investment projections, economic reviews and policy proposals for each candidate to determine which jobs are most likely to pop during a Clinton administration — and which would boom during a Trump administration.” A Clinton White House Industries that could thrive under a Clinton victory, as per author Anna Bahney: Infrastructure: Clinton has said she would allocate $275 billion to infrastructure over five years. Companies that could benefit from this include Aecom (NYSE: ACM), Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) and Deere & Company (NYSE: DE). Solar Energy: The Democratic presidential candidate said she would make a big push to get the United States’ solar capacity to 140 gigawatts before the end of 2020. Firms in the business include SolarCity Corp (NASDAQ: SCTY), SunPower Corporation (NASDAQ: SPWR) Vivint Solar Inc (NYSE: VSLR) and First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR). Renewable Energy: The third industry poised to boom under a Clinton administration is that of renewable energy. Some plays in the field are biofuels makers Renewable Energy Group Inc (NASDAQ: REGI) and FutureFuel Corp. (NYSE: FF). A Trump White House Industries that could benefit from a Trump win include: Private Prisons and Security: Trump’s focus on detaining and deporting undocumented workers could certainly help private prisons operator The GEO Group Inc (NYSE: GEO) and Corrections Corp Of America (NYSE: CXW), among other security companies. Building Materials: If Trump’s wall becomes a reality, materials providers would have a party of their own. Among companies to benefit, the following could presumably benefit: (ironically, Mexican) Cemex SAB de CV (ADR) (NYSE: CX), Bahney noted. Others that could get a piece of the pie include Lafarge SA (ADR) (OTC: LFRGY) and Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) Oil: Trump has promised to defeat ISIS by taking their oil. He promised he would instead assure American companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) would exploit the resource in the Middle East. Disclosure: Javier Hasse holds no interest in any of the securities or entities mentioned above."
2016-11-11,Pro: 3 Stocks Could Benefit From Trump's Infrastructure Plan,"Kathryn Thompson is the CEO of Thompson Research Group, an equity research firm that specializes in building materials, building products, construction and other related sectors. She was a guest on CNBC's Power Lunch to discuss which stocks could benefit from President-Elect Donald Trump's proposed infrastructure plan. She was quick to point out whether the infrastructure plan calls for building roads, rail or waterways, the same stocks will likely benefit. Specifically, the expert highlighted Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM), Summit Materials Inc (NYSE: SUM) and Headwaters Inc (NYSE: HW). Thompson said the US is on the brink of the largest infrastructure plan since the end of World War 2 and is driven by 1) The FAST Act. 2) States and local communities are tired of waiting around for the federal government for infrastructure support. 3) President-Elect Trump's proposed infrastructure project which could amount to $1 trillion over 10 years. Thompson added that while Trump's $1 trillion plan over 10 years sounds like a large sum, in reality it's not that far removed from President Obama's stimulus plan which initially called for $800 billion in spending over a five to six-year time period."
2016-11-30,"Jim Cramer Advises Viewers On Boeing, US Concrete And Duke Energy","Jim Cramer said on CNBC's Mad Money that investors should hold Boeing Co (NYSE: BA), which is trading at its 52-week high. The U.S. residential and non-residential construction companies are going to continue to do well, thinks Cramer, but instead of buying US Concrete Inc (NASDAQ: USCR), he would rather buy Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM). Cramer thinks Martin Marietta Materials has a better management. Cramer would not sell Duke Energy Corp (NYSE: DUK). He added that investors should be careful because the stock is interest rates sensitive and with the increase in interest rates, it trades lower."
2017-01-11,"Freeport-McMoRan, Martin Marietta And Steel's Strength In The Trump Rally","The Trump rally has benefited certain sectors more than others. One of the strongest sectors that benefited is materials and metals stocks. CNBC's Dominic Chu explained that it's widely believed materials and metals stocks will benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's administration given his plans to invest $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over the coming years. The strong investor sentiment is most apparent in the exchange traded fund which trackers the materials sector, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) which is higher by more than 25 percent over the past year. In fact, among the 25 members of the S&P 500 materials sector, nine of the stocks have rallied to the point where it's trading at least 10 percent above its 200-day average trading price. Among the notables in Chu's list, the major gravel, stone and sand provider Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) is trading 15 percent above its 200-day moving average. In addition, steel company Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) is trading around 17 percent above its 200-day moving average. However, these returns are overshadowed by Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX) which is trading at the biggest premium in its group to the 200-day average at 31 percent."
2017-01-25,Trump's Border Wall: A Look At The Numbers,"There are plenty of things for Americans who disapprove of President Donald Trump to criticize. So far, inaction is not one of them. In his first week in office, Trump has already taken measures to follow up on several key campaign promises. On Wednesday, he is expected meet with the Department of Homeland Security to discuss the logistics of building a concrete wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Discussion of the border wall typically triggered some of the loudest cheers during Trump’s stump speeches throughout the campaign season. Critics have blasted Trump’s border wall plan as economically infeasible, but Trump has insisted that Mexico will pay for the construction of the wall. The Cost Statista recently put together the graphic below outlining the economics of the proposed wall. The latest version of Trump’s vision includes a 1,000-mile-long, 40-foot-high wall that will stretch more than half the total length of the U.S./Mexico border. The border wall will require an estimated $711 million of concrete and $240 million of cement. However, those materials costs pale in comparison to the estimated labor costs of building the wall. Trump has said the wall would cost an estimated $10 billion–12 billion, but Bernstein Research pegs the actual number in the $15 billion–25 billion range. Shares of materials stocks, particularly those in the concrete segment, are up on Wednesday ahead of Trump’s anticipated announcement. Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) is up 1.5 percent, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) is up 2.9 percent, China Advanced Constructn Mtrls Grp Inc (NASDAQ:CADC) is up 4.0 percent and US Concrete Inc (NASDAQ:USCR) is up 3.3 percent. Developing Story Despite no tangible plans for repayment, as explained by Press Sec. Sean Spicer in Wednesday's press briefing, Trump stated in his first one-on-one interview with ABC News that Mexico will absolutely and 100 percent pay for the wall. Update: In a White House breaking news release at 1:37 p.m. EST, Spicer announced Trump's order of construction of the wall.

2017-01-29,Trump's Wall Plans Lift This ETF,"Politicians are no strangers to controversy and many are familiar with campaign trail bluster that ultimately goes unfulfilled. Love him or hate, President Donald Trump is moving forward with his plan to build a wall around the U.S.-Mexico border. So Trump, no stranger to controversy, is at least attempting to make good on one of his campaign trail promises, which is more than can be said of many politicians. A cornerstone of Trump's campaign was stricter immigration policy. In addition to the border wall effort, the new president has also pledged to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities, or those cities opting to stand in violation of federal law in order to harbor illegal immigrants. To be clear, this article is neither condemnation nor endorsement of Trump's immigration policies or the wall effort. It's merely to highlight an investment opportunity that is positively responding to the effort to build the wall. Enter the PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (NYSE:PKB). The PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio was one of a few dozen exchange traded funds printing all-time highs on Wednesday. Some of the ebullience surrounding PKB is being attributed to strong housing data, but PKB is not a homebuilder ETF on par with a fund such as the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (NYSE:ITB). Rather, the PowerShares offering tracks “companies that are primarily engaged in providing construction and related engineering services for building and remodeling residential properties, commercial or industrial buildings, or working on large-scale infrastructure projects, such as highways, tunnels, bridges, dams, power lines, and airport,” according to PowerShares. Home to 30 stocks, PKB holds names such as Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (NYSE:MLM) and Vulcan Materials Co. (NYSE:VMC), holdings that explain the ETF's leverage to speculation about Trump's wall plans. As Benzinga noted Wednesday, The border wall will require an estimated $711 million of concrete and $240 million of cement. However, those materials costs pale in comparison to the estimated labor costs of building the wall. Trump has said the wall would cost an estimated $10–12 billion, but Bernstein Research pegs the actual number in the $15–25 billion range. However, even if Trump's wall desires are never realized, PKB can still benefit if the new president is able to push through parts of massive $1 trillion infrastructure effort. A glance at PKB's roster indicate the ETF is bound to benefit from that scenario just as it has wall chatter. PKB is up 6.2 percent since the start of 2017 and nearly 39 percent over the past year."
2017-02-15,Intelligent Infrastructure Index Emphasizes The Technology Side Of Connected Infrastructure Projects,"Donald Trump’s plan to invest up to $1 trillion in domestic infrastructure projects has U.S. infrastructure investors excited about the potential tailwinds that government projects could provide in the market over the next decade. Traditionally, infrastructure stocks include construction and materials stocks such as Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM). However, Kensho Indices has put together an infrastructure index that focuses on the technology integration that will be key to the next decade of American infrastructure spending. “The New Economies Intelligent Infrastructure sector captures the full range of developments from smart buildings and road networks to smart grids that use sensors and intelligent meters to manage power lines and optimize power consumption,” Kenso explains on its website. See Also: The Tue Cost Of Fixing's America's Infrastructure The firm has put together the Kensho Intelligent Infrastructure Index (KINFRA), an index of U.S. companies that should play an important role in the new market of intelligent infrastructure. In the past year, the index is up 38.8 percent compared to only a 25.1 percent gain for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and a 16.1 percent gain from the iShares S&P Global Infrastructure Index (NASDAQ:IGF). The IGF ETF, which is one the most heavily-traded infrastructure ETF on the market today, is only about 40 percent allocated to U.S. stocks. KINFRA holdings are more than 75 percent American companies. Top KINFRA holdings include Roper Technologies Inc (NYSE:ROP), ABB Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:ABB) and Toro Co (NYSE:TTC)."

2017-03-31,Jim Cramer's 2 Picks For Trump's Infrastructure Project,"Despite being struck with a major defeat in healthcare, President Donald Trump remains dedicated toward overseeing a major infrastructure initiative as soon as this year. As such, investors are looking to capitalize on companies that will benefit from what could be an injection of $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over the coming decade. CNBC's Jim Cramer offered two stocks for investors to consider during Friday's Squawk on the Street segment. Marin Marietta Materials And Nucor Shares of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) were trading higher by more than 3 percent on Friday, likely as a result of Cramer naming the supplier of crushed stone, sand, and gravel as a suitable infrastructure play. Cramer's other pick, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) was trading lower by around 0.50 percent on Friday. Cramer explained that Martin Marietta is an obvious materials & aggregate play, and many infrastructure projects would need to use the company's products. Although not similar to Marin Marietta, Cramer emphasized the fact that Nucor invested billions of dollars in its business over the years which makes it a very in-expensive stock to own. Cramer also recommended investors remain cautious on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) after the company was subject to an accounting investigation. Also, the stock is heavily shorted although at the end of the day Caterpillar remains a great American company and has strong prospects in China.

2017-08-31,Cramer's Top Stock Picks Post Hurricane Harvey,"One of the many things America does best is to rebuild itself to be bigger and better than it was before. Along the way, a small handful of companies will play a vital role in rebuilding the fourth-largest city in the U.S., which was taken offline by Hurricane Harvey, CNBC's Jim Cramer commented during his daily Mad Money show Wednesday. The federal government is expected to disburse tens of billions of dollars for a rebuilding effort that will be so enormous, with no industry spared, Cramer continued. For example, there are around half a million cars that will need to be replaced, which bodes well for the auto industry — but not necessarily so for the insurance sector. Some of the more obvious sectors that will benefit include home-building materials like Weyerhaeuser Co (NYSE:WY), Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) and USG Corporation (NYSE:USG), Cramer added. Also, road aggregates like Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) could see a boost, along with roofing companies like Owens Corning (NYSE OC) and Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc. (NASDAQ:BECN). To a lesser extent, do-it-yourself home improvement retailers like Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) will benefit, Cramer said. The reason for this is that the post-Harvey rebuild will be much more organized and under-control compared to the post-Katrina reconstruction which in some areas haven't been completed yet. President Donald Trump's leadership at this critical time is also sending a positive message to the market, Cramer concluded. The president hasn't made any off-message remarks and is acting presidential, which by itself is worth a couple of percent on the upside.

2017-12-14,"Barclays Constructs A Bullish Call On Caterpillar, CNH Industrial And Others","The American machinery and construction industry is likely to see better times ahead, according to Barclays. The firm initiated coverage of the sector with a Positive outlook. Coming off several once-in-a-100-years cycles, the sales bases are the low, the political rhetoric is high and the risk-reward is still skewed positive despite the market run, analyst Adam Seiden said in a note. Seiden initiated coverage of 18 companies with a Positive view. We believe the earnings, the denominator in P/E, will keep valuations attractive within the normalized 10-20x framework, he said. The analyst expects the companies in his coverage universe to grow over the next two to three years, with investors willing to put a higher multiple on that growth. The about-face in investor sentiment toward the machinery space is mostly attributable to Washington and the prospect for tax reform, the analyst said. Looking at macro and micro data pertaining to the industry, Barclays said GDP, PMI and manufacturing demand all have improved, while retail sales at Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) have also progressed. Among other metrics, the firm said: Inventories are in-line. Used equipment values in U.S. agricultural and construction sectors are either stable or slowly rising. Units and horsepower are converging. Mining equipment sales are up 80 percent year-over-year in the third quarter. Global infrastructure demand is turning favorable for heavy equipment.

2018-01-23,The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500,"Last week I highlighted the Top 10 Value Stocks In The S&P 500 noting that value will have its day in the sun in 2018. This is not a widely held view considering the Russell 1000 Growth index (IWF) has returned 32.2% over the last year while the Russell 1000 Value index (IWD) has returned only 14.7%. Furthermore, high flying Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped to another all-time high after reporting Q4 numbers on Monday after the bell. Total subscriber growth increased 25.4% YoY which helped send the company's market cap to over $100 billion. The chart below highlights Netflix amazing growth as well as its -$510 million cash burn in Q4 (-$2 billion in fiscal year 2017). Source: Avory & Co. Netflix is a timely reminder of just how much momentum these growth stocks continue to have in this market, no matter what valuation multiple they trade at. And while research suggests owning high quality value stocks significantly outperforms in the long-run, high quality growth stocks (such as Netflix) still have steam. Therefore, I decided to find companies that may be masquerading around as high growth stocks but really are not to be trifled with. In order to find these pricey stocks, I downloaded the list of S&P 500 constituents and then used finbox.io's spreadsheet add-on to find which companies had the following: 1) a P/E multiple that trades above its comparable public companies, and 2) projected 5-year earnings growth that's below its comparable public companies. OR 3) an EBITDA multiple that trades above its comparable public companies, and 4) projected 5-year EBITDA growth that's below its comparable public companies. AND 5) has downside as calculated from finbox.io's fair value > 20%. Here are the 10 most expensive stocks in the S&P 500 that I found. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: ProLogis ProLogis Inc (NYSE:PLD) is a global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets. As of September 30, 2017, the company owned or had investments in properties and development projects expected to total approximately 687 million square feet in 19 countries. Prologis leases modern distribution facilities to a diverse base of approximately 5,200 customers across two major categories: business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment. Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes Duke Realty Corp (NYSE:DRE), DCT Industrial Trust Inc (NYSE:DCT), First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc (NYSE:FR) and EastGroup Properties Inc (NYSE:EGP). The company's LTM EBITDA multiple of 27.1x is above all of its selected comparable public companies: DRE (14.9x), DCT (24.8x), FR (19.8x) and EGP (22.7x). Therefore you would expect the company's future growth to be above its peer group. However, ProLogis' projected 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 4.8% is only above DRE (-3.7%) and below DCT (9.1%), FR (6.4%) and EGP (7.2%). Source: finbox.io Shares of the company are up 21.1% over the last year. The stock last traded at $63.11 as of Monday January 22 and eleven separate valuation analyses imply that there is significant downside relative to its current trading price. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Macerich Macerich Co (NYSE:MAC) is a fully integrated self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust, which focuses on the acquisition, leasing, and management of regional malls throughout the United States. Macerich currently owns 54 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 48 regional shopping centers. On a comparable company basis, selected benchmark companies include CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (NYSE:CBL), Brixmor Property Group Inc (NYSE:BRX), Kimco Realty Corp (NYSE:KIM) and Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT). Higher growth companies typically trade at higher valuation multiples but this does not appear to be the case for Macerich as shown below. The company's projected 5-year net income CAGR of -28.7% is well below its entire peer group: CBL (-14.3%), BRX (18.1%), KIM (-5.1%) and FRT (4.0%). However, Macerich's P/E multiple of 64.7x is above CBL (10.4x), BRX (16.3x), KIM (19.3x) and FRT (30.6x). The company appears to be expensive on a future cash flow basis as well.

2020-06-16,"Analyst: Vulcan, Martin Marietta Could Be $1T Infrastructure Spending Winners","Infrastructure stocks traded higher this week on reports that the Trump administration is preparing a $1 trillion infrastructure investment stimulus bill. Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said it’s unlikely the bill will successfully make its way through Congress in an election year, but headlines related to infrastructure spending could still move markets. Infrastructure investment in general has bipartisan support in Washington. However, Tanners said politics will likely make getting a bill passed in 2020 very unlikely. In addition, Tanners said issues such as pandemic-related stimulus, police reform and health care will likely have higher priority than infrastructure investment ahead of the November election. “While the need for infrastructure spending has been a repeated mantra of President Trump’s since his campaign in 2016, no such stimulus has been passed and indeed our contacts suggest any passage would be challenged by partisan politics, despite general support from both sides of the aisle,” Tanners wrote in a note. How To Play It: Despite the fact that Bank of America sees “little chance” Democrats and Republicans will reach an infrastructure compromise this year, Tanners said Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) are best-positioned to benefit. Tanners also named Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) as the best-positioned steel stock should an infrastructure bill ultimately be passed. Benzinga’s Take: U.S. infrastructure is in desperate need of improvement, but investors shouldn’t expect politicians to put the good of the country ahead of getting reelected. Infrastructure spending will likely be a popular topic of discussion as the 2020 campaigns heat up, but analysts seem to believe it is unlikely Washington will take action this year.

2020-08-10,Tesla Paid Nearly $100M To Acquire Texas Gigafactory Land,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) paid nearly $100 million for the 2,000-acre land on which it plans to build its latest gigafactory, Electrek reported Sunday. What Happened The former owner of the property, TXI Operations LP, a unit of Martin Marietta Inc (NYSE:MLM), revealed in an earnings call on July 28 that it sold a “depleted standing gravel location” for $97 million, as earlier reported by local Austin media. TXI IOperations didn't give further details on the property it sold, or the name of the buyer, but according to Electrek, the reference is to none other than Tesla's under-construction manufacturing facility near Austin, Texas. The electric vehicles maker had purchased the land through its subsidiary Colorado River Project, LLC. Why It Matters Heavy machinery has been spotted at the site since the last month, on all days of the week, Electrek noted. The scale of the upcoming factory is impressive and the new facility could potentially become one of the world's largest buildings, upon completion. CEO Elon Musk said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call that the Texas factory would have walking paths and other natural features for the public to enjoy. The Gigafactory would primarily be used to build the company’s all-electric pickup vehicle, the Cybertruck. Price Action Tesla shares closed 2.48% lower at $1,452.71 on Friday."

2020-12-18,Why Morgan Stanley Likes Martin Marietta Materials,"While fiscal 2021 may be impacted by weakness in the non-residential construction segment and muted Infrastructure spend, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) and Summit Materials Inc (NYSE:SUM) are likely to witness robust tailwinds in fiscal 2022 and beyond, according to Morgan Stanley. The Machinery Analyst: Courtney Yakavonis initiated coverage of Martin Marietta Materials with an Overweight rating and a price target of $316. She also initiated coverage of Vulcan Materials and Summit Materials with Equal-Weight ratings and price targets of $150 and $22, respectively. The Machinery Thesis: Although aggregates have among the strongest business models within the machinery segment, they serve a highly cyclical construction end market, Yakavonis said. “While the outlook for Resi construction is bright headed into FY21, we believe the remaining 75-85% of Aggregate companies' Non Resi and Infrastructure related exposure is at risk in the through FY21. Pricing should offset most of these anticipated volume declines, but upside is limited in the short term,” she wrote in a note. The analyst noted that aggregates stocks had underperformed the market, down 1% year to date, and may outperform only after there are “tangible signs of a Non-Resi or Infrastructure recovery.” “We prefer Martin Marietta (MLM) over peers due to its better state-level outlook, stronger pricing power, and potential for a re-rating,” Yakavonis added."

Analysts may attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish analyst ratings for stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter. Analysts may suggest actions like buy, sell, hold, or similar verbage for each stock based on research compiled from the corresponding company. Analysts who suggest buy are telling traders to purchase the stock based on forecasted growth. On the flip side, analysts who suggest sell are telling traders to dump the stock because of a similarly forecasted decline. Analysts who suggest hold are telling investors that they see short-term or mid-term stagnation and to maintain their positions on the stock. Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors."

Analysts work in banking and financial systems and typically specialize in reporting for stocks or defined sectors. Analysts may attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish analyst ratings for stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter. Analysts may suggest actions like buy, sell, hold, or similar verbage for each stock based on research compiled from the corresponding company. Analysts who suggest buy are telling traders to purchase the stock based on forecasted growth. On the flip side, analysts who suggest sell are telling traders to dump the stock because of a similarly forecasted decline. Analysts who suggest hold are telling investors that they see short-term or mid-term stagnation and to maintain their positions on the stock. Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings. When using analyst ratings, it is important to keep in mind that stock and sector analysts are also human and are only offering their opinions to investors."

2021-07-29,Unusual Options Activity Insight: Martin Marietta Materials,"Shares of Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) saw some unusual options activity on Thursday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $371.33. Sentiment: NEUTRAL Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2022-01-21 Strike Price: $330.00 Volume: 200 Open Interest: 38 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-08-30,Understanding Martin Marietta Materials's Ex-Dividend Date,"Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) declared a dividend payable on September 30, 2021 to its shareholders as of August 12, 2021. It was also announced that shareholders of Martin Marietta Materials's stock as of September 1, 2021 are entitled to the dividend. The stock is expected to become ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. The ex-dividend date for Martin Marietta Materials will be on August 31, 2021. The company's current dividend payout is at $0.61. That equates to a dividend yield of 0.62% at current price levels. Understanding Ex-Dividend Dates' Ex-dividend dates signal when company shares cease to trade with their current dividend payouts. There is a small intermission period before companies announce new dividends. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. Understanding Martin Marietta Materials's Dividend History Over the past year, Martin Marietta Materials has seen its dividend payouts climb upward and its yields trend downward. Last year on August 31, 2020 the company's payout sat at $0.57, which has since increased by $0.04. Martin Marietta Materials's dividend yield last year was 1.03%, which has since decreased by 0.41%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market.

2021-12-19,"CNBC's Final Trades: Martin Marietta, Palo Alto, SoFi And This ETF For Exposure To EV Segment","On CNBC’s “Halftime Report Final Trades,” Shannon Saccocia of Boston Private said Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) provides exposure to “infrastructure, aggregates as well as cement construction in Texas.” Although the stock has already benefited from a focus on infrastructure, “there’s still some opportunity here to add,” she commented. Bryn Talkington of Requisite Capital Management named Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF (NYSE:LIT) as her top pick. You don’t need to buy stocks of carmakers for exposure to the EV segment, Talkington said. The ETF includes companies manufacturing the components, she added. Jason Snipe of Odyssey Capital Advisors said Palo Alto Networks Inc (NASDAQ:PANW) has “done a lot of spending this year” and it’s most likely behind them now. These investments have prepared the company for future growth, he added. “I like them. Stay long,” Snipe mentioned. Pete Najarian cited SoFi Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SOFI) as his top pick. “This is a stock that’s going higher,” he added.

A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Martin Marietta Materials, which is trading around $385.91 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events.

2022-08-02,Looking Into Martin Marietta Materials's Return On Capital Employed,"According to Benzinga Pro, during Q2, Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) earned $366.40 million, a 1620.19% increase from the preceding quarter. Martin Marietta Materials also posted a total of $1.52 billion in sales, a 32.75% increase since Q1. In Q1, Martin Marietta Materials earned $21.30 million, and total sales reached $1.15 billion. What Is ROCE? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, Martin Marietta Materials posted an ROCE of 0.05%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Martin Marietta Materials is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. For Martin Marietta Materials, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.05% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Analyst Predictions Martin Marietta Materials reported Q2 earnings per share at $3.96/share, which beat analyst predictions of $3.81/share.

A so-called golden cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bullish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher.

The golden cross occurs when the 50-day crosses above the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Martin Marietta Materials, which is trading around $339.93 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Golden Crosses.

2023-06-05,"This Dublin Gravel Supplier Is Undervalued Compared To Rivals VMC, MLM: Here's Why","A construction supply company stands to benefit from recent U.S. government initiatives. What Happened: According to Street Sheet, traders would be wise to consider CRH plc (LON: CRH), which currently touts a $35.4 billion market cap. The Dublin-based company will likely see an uptick in demand for its products, which are used to make concrete, cement, and asphalt. Why? Because some $2 trillion in spending will pour into the economy due to three pieces of legislation: The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2021. The Inflation Reduction Act, enacted by President Joe Biden last August. The Chips Act, which provides tax credits and subsidies for domestic U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. See Also: Dow Drops Over 100 Points, Crude Oil Rises CRH is an undervalued stock to watch, Street Sheet explained, citing the growing need for building supplies as new battery plants and chip facilities get built. The stock gained 23% during the past 12 months, but it currently trades at 11x the estimated 2024 earnings, whereas its competitors — Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) and Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) — trade at 22x and 25x forward earnings, respectively. Why It Matters: CRH, which stands for Cement Roadstone Holdings, is in the process of moving its primary stock market listing to the U.S. This will help CRH establish stateside recognition and close the valuation gaps it has with its rivals. Reporting rules in the U.S. will also make it easier to compare CRH to its two American competitors: MLM and VMC. That could, in turn, drive the stock higher. Meanwhile, commercial construction activity in the U.S. was up 19% in March year-over-year, and road construction is up 20%. More of the same, if not better, can be in the cards for soon-to-be US-listed CRH, Street Sheet predicts.

2023-07-27,"Martin Marietta Materials Q2: Revenue Miss, Lower Aggregates Shipments & More","Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) reported second-quarter FY23 revenue growth of 10.9% year-over-year to $1.82 billion, missing the consensus of $1.83 billion. EPS was $5.60, compared to $5.65 a year ago, beating the consensus of $4.85. Gross profit was $560.4 million (+31.8% Y/Y), and the margin expanded by 488 bps to 30.8%. The operating margin was 25.4%, down by 371 bps from 2Q22. Adjusted EBITDA improved 24.6% Y/Y to $596.1 million, margin expanded by 360 bps to 32.7%. MLM's operating cash flow year-to-date was $518.5 million compared with $286.2 million for the prior-year period. The company held $421.5 million of unrestricted cash and equivalents on hand and $1.20 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities as of June 30, 2023. The company returned $232.5 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases for the six months ended June 30, 2023. Building Materials business revenue was $1.74 billion (+11.6% Y/Y), and the corresponding gross profit was $536.1 million (+34.3% Y/Y). Aggregates shipments decreased 5.7% while pricing increased 18.6%, or 17.0% on a mix-adjusted basis. As record-setting public funds for infrastructure and manufacturing begin to enter the U.S. economy, we continue to expect that aggregates demand will accelerate in the second half of 2023. This well-chronicled increased investment should largely offset the current residential construction air pocket, which we expect to bottom in the third quarter of 2023, commented Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. FY23 Guidance: Martin Marietta Materials now expects FY23 total revenues of $6.725 billion-$6.86 billion (prior $6.60 billion-$6.815 billion) vs. consensus $6.82 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion-$2.1 billion (prior $1.8 billion-$1.9 billion). The company expects average selling price growth of 17%-19% for Aggregates. Price Action: MLM shares are trading lower by 2.24% at $448.14 on the last check Thursday."

2023-11-01,Building Material Company Martin Marietta's Q3 Bottomline Beats Despite Softer Demand In Certain Midwest & Southwest Markets: Here's Details,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) reported third-quarter FY23 revenue growth of 10.1% year-over-year to $1.994 billion, marginally missing the consensus of $1.999 billion. EPS from continuing operations was $6.94, compared to $4.67 a year ago, beating the consensus of $6.06. Gross profit was $676 million (+38.6% Y/Y), and the margin expanded by 698 bps to 33.9%. The operating margin was 28.4%, up by 600 bps YoY. Adjusted EBITDA improved 32.3% Y/Y to $705.2 million, margin expanded by 594 bps to 35.4%. MLM's operating cash flow year-to-date was $972.5 million compared with $560.7 million for the prior-year period. The company held $647.6 million of cash and equivalents and $1.20 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities as of September 30, 2023. The company returned $278.2 million to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Building Materials business revenue was $ 1.9 billion (+10.5% Y/Y), and the corresponding gross profit was $649.5 million (+38.4% Y/Y). Aggregate shipments decreased by 7.3%, while pricing increased by 20%, or 17.2%, on a mix-adjusted basis. Consistent with our aggregates-led product focus, on October 31, 2023, we closed the sale of our Tehachapi, California cement plant for $315 million, which largely concludes planned asset sales from the 2021 Lehigh Hanson West acquisition. This divestiture not only improves our product mix, but also provides additional balance sheet flexibility to redeploy the proceeds into pure-play aggregates acquisitions, commented Ward Nye, Chairman and CEO. FY23 Guidance: Martin Marietta Materials now expects FY23 total revenues of $6.735 billion-$6.855 billion (prior $6.725 billion-$6.86 billion) vs. consensus $6.85 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $2.05 billion-$2.15 billion (prior $2 billion-$2.1 billion). The company expects average selling price growth of 18%-20% (prior 17%-19%) for Aggregates. Price Action: MLM shares are trading higher by 5.39% at $431.00 on the last check Wednesday."
