Its stock traded below $1 at the beginning of March but made a fantastic comeback, trading near $13.

2009-10-22,Jim Cramer Thinks That Silicon Vally Arrests Could  Be Next,"Jim Cramer talked with CNBC's Erin Burnett about today's trading session, and said that he is happy that there were no news about arrests in hedge fund business and that this day is not hostile to oil. He also gave an opinion about Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and 3M (NYSE: MMM), saying that Nucor (NUE) is not doing well which is weird because it is an important industrial manufacturer. Cramer than added that 3M (MMM) is doing well today. Cramer then said that he heard of a possible arrests of the people from Silicon Vally who got rich and allowed hedge fund managers to get rich by giving up a joint of their company."
2009-10-22,Nucor CEO Says Dividend Is Going Nowhere But Up,"In an interview with Jim Cramer, Nucor's (NYSE: NUE) President and CEO Dan DiMicco said the steelmaker's dividend is going nowhere but up. Nucor currently yields 3.1% and pays a $1.40 a share per year. Earlier today, Nucor reported a loss of $29.5 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with a profit of $734.6 million, or $2.31 a share, in the year-ago period. Despite the loss, Nucor remains one of the higher quality names in the steel sector and the stock is up nearly 30% in the past year."
2009-10-27,Can U.S. Steel Hold $40? ,"It goes without saying that analysts are expecting an ugly third-quarter report out of U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) before the bell today with a loss of $2.87 forecast. With other steel names such as AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) and Schnitzer Steel (Nasdaq: SCHN) reporting today, the sector promises to be in play. Technically speaking, a break below $40 would be a bearish sign for U.S. Steel, the eigth-largest steelmaker in the world. A break below $40 could take the shares to $28. In all fairness, given the declining sales and lack of profits, U.S. Steel is richly valued at 42 times 2010 earnings and far more expensive than rivals AK Steel, Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and others. That makes the earnings announcement especially pivotal for U.S. Steel's near-term fortunes."
2009-11-06,The Other Steel ETF (PSTL),"The ETF Professor saw a report today that got him thinking. Is there more to steel ETFs than just the Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX)? Fortunately, the answer is yes and it comes in the form of the PowerShares Global Steel Portfolio (NYSE: PSTL). SLX is a mix of North American and international steel stocks, holding the likes of U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and Brazil's Vale (NYSE: VALE). In other words, SLX focuses heavily on large caps. On the other hand, PSTL gives investors more growth exposure as it holds 58% large caps compared to almost 69% for SLX, according to ETFdatabase. PSTL is more diverse in terms of geography as well with 37.3% in Asia, 17.9% in Europe, and roughly 11% in both North and South America. SLX is 40% focused on North America, ETFdatabase said. SLX has outperformed PSTL recently, but the North American steel industry is a tougher play than foreign markets. The ETF Professor thinks steel demand in the emerging markets will increase next year due to a spate of new infrastructure projects and given the growth bias of this ETF, PSTL is worth a look for longer-term investors."

Potash (POT) closed at $110.60 with 6.16% increase in price. Pete Najarian believes that Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.(NYSE: CLF) has a lot of upside potential because of its exposure to iron ore and metallurgic coal. He recommends it as a buy. Cliffs Natural (CLF) jumped 1.52% on Tuesday and closed at $44.03. Karen Finerman likes General Cable Corporation (NYSE: BGC) and would buy it tomorrow. General Cable (BGC) added 0.48% to close at $33.40 in today's trading session."
2009-11-30,"Cramer Bullish On State Street, Steel Names",Jim Cramer mentioned steelmakers Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and Steel Dynamics (Nasdaq: STLD) as good trades in the steel sector and State Street (NYSE: STT) as a financial name to watch. The interview just aired on CNBC.

2009-12-30,"Trade Panel Rules for U.S. Steelmakers in Landmark Case (X, NUE)",A U.S. trade panel gave final approval Wednesday to duties ranging from about 10 to 16 percent on Chinese-made steel pipe. The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled 6-0 in favor of the duties set by the U.S. Commerce Department to offset Chinese Government Subsidies. The duties will help protect domestic steel producers like United States Steel (NYSE: X) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) by stemming the flood of imports from China of subsidized steel. Shares of United States Steel and Nucor Corporation are trading higher today on the ruling.
2009-12-30,"Biggest Steel Case Before International Trade Commission (NUE, STLD)","According to the Wall Street Journal, U.S. steel-makers claimed that they have faced severe losses as a result of $2.8 billion of subsidized Chinese steel being dumped into the U.S. It is the biggest steel case ever to come before the International Trade Commission (ITC). If the ruling is in favor of the U.S. industry, the result is a likely imposition of duties on future imports of Chinese steel pipes and tubes used by energy companies. Some of the well known steel companies include Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD). Nucor and Steel Dynamics are eagerly waiting for ITC’s ruling."
2010-01-04,Nucor Collar Looks Like A Solid Trade,"With ISM manufacturing numbers surprising to the upside, steel stocks look very appealing. The volatility on Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE) is close to a 12 month low at 31%, and a bet on higher prices can be accomplished with a 50-46 collar for zero cost. Currently the January 50 calls and the January 46 puts are trading close to 35 cents. There are 12 days to expiration, and NUE looks like it is technically breaking out to the upside. At the moment there does not seem to be a skew to either side, which places the puts and calls at parity. At worst, you are buying the stock at 46, if you purchase the call and sell the put."
2010-01-06,"Tim Seymour Likes NUE, AKS, ATI, TIE","CNBC Fast Money's Tim Seymour commented on the Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) upgrade of the steel sector and said that he likes Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE: ATI) and Titanium Metals Corporation (NYSE: TIE). Tim Seymour believes that Nucor (NUE) and AK Steel (AKS) are interesting because they underperformed big steel names like US Steel (NYSE: X). Allegheny (ATI) and Titanium Metals (TIE) are especially interesting to Tim Seymour because they started to show some movement. He also sees an increase in the production of stainless steel. Nucor (NUE) closed 3.01% higher and AK Steel (AKS) gained 5.06% today. Allegheny (ATI) jumped 2.43%, while spiked 7.62%."
2010-01-07,"Cramer Prefers GIS, PFE, T, MO, WM, MMM, KO, EMR, NUE For Dividends","According to Cramer, investing in bonds and certificates of deposit (COD), although low risk, will be an extremely bad decision, especially at a time when interest rates are at record lows. Jim prefers buying any of the following stocks to generate a good dividend income: General Mills (NYSE: GIS): The company has recently raised its per share dividend to $0.49 from $0.47 for the second time in 2009, indicating strength in GIS. Although GIS’ dividend yield of 2.8% may not seem impressive, steadily increasing payouts do look attractive. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE): Before PFE purchased Wyeth, Cramer was never impressed by the company enough to recommend it. However, he became PFE’s fan after the company disclosed that the deal helped save $4 billion in costs and enhanced its pipeline and product portfolio. With the recent hike in dividends from $0.16 to $0.18 a share, PFE’s yield now stands at 3.8%. Cramer also expects PFE to return a massive $46 billion to shareholders over the next five years. AT&T (NYSE: T): Cramer says that T is a big, safe telecommunication company that has high exposure to the rapid adoption of smartphones. T has recently raised its dividend to $0.42, which has raised its yield to 6.1%. Altria (NYSE: MO): When MO spun off Kraft Foods and Philip Morris International, Cramer labeled it as a “steady domestic tobacco company.” MO currently has a dividend yield of 6.8% and has returned up to 504% to shareholders over the past 20 years, if the investors have reinvested the dividends in the company. The point is that this return has been delivered even when the S&P 500 index has lost 25%. Waste Management (NYSE: WM): WM has strong market share of the waste removal/disposal and landfill facilities. As a result, WM has pricing power, which has come in handy during the recession. WM hiked its dividend on December 17, 2009, by 8.6%, increasing the yield to 3.8%. 3M (NYSE: MMM): According to Cramer, MMM is the “perfect proxy for any rebound in the market,”as it manufacturers diverse products, ranging from Post-It notes to glass computer screens, health-care products and scotch tape. Although MMM has a dividend yield of only 2.5%, it has been consistently raising it for more than half a century, the last hike being in February 2009. Cramer believes that another dividend hike is the offing. Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR): EMR has an yield of 3.1%, following the increase in November 2009 for the 53rd consecutive year. Shareholders who have reinvested their payouts over the past decade have earned 89%, as compared to the 25% decline in the S&P 500. Cramer expects the company to announce the next dividend hike by early February 2010. Cramer also likes EMR for its global exposure. Nucor (NYSE: NUE): Under the leadership of CEO Dan DiMicco, NUE has hiked its annual dividend to $1.44 per share, raising the yield to 3.2%. This is despite the absence of the US stimulus spending on infrastructure and continued steel dumping from China. Cramer expects NUE to restore its special dividend this year, which is likely to boost its payout. Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO): Although KO has an yield of just 2.9%, the company has been raising its dividends for 47 consecutive years. Cramer expects KO to hike its dividend again when it declares its next payout in early 2010."
2010-01-11,"Metals Roundup: Markets Await Alcoa Numbers (CLF, NUE, MT, AA)","Analysts at Deutsche Bank have rated Cliffs (NYSE: CLF), Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) as Top picks in a recent report on the metals sector. Iron ore prices have been rallying in recent times due to several steel price increases announced in China. Ferrous scrap prices have also risen to $65-$80 per ton. Alcoa (NYSE: AA) announced plans to lay off 235 employees in its Rigid Packaging division during 1Q while ArcelorMittal has announced that it will restart its third blast furnace at its Dunkirk facility in January. Alcoa is expected to announce its results on January 11th and Deutsche estimates 4Q09 normalized basic EPS of $0.07 with stronger aluminium prices being offset by higher energy costs."
2010-01-15,"Cramer Is Aggressive On UPL, Lackluster on Chinese Automotive Stocks","Despite the announcement of a new tax on TARP recipients, low retail sales and unemployment numbers and credit card defaults, markets have been moving up since March 2009. Jim Cramer, the host of the “Mad Money” show, declared that bears had been wrong all along and bulls have been proved right. Among the natural gas stocks, Cramer was excited about Ultra Petroleum (NYSE: UPL), which has lagged its peers Chesapeake (NYSE: CHK), Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) and Apache (NYSE: APA). Although UPL’s shares have moved up only 15% since August, Jim feels that they should excel, considering that natural gas account for 95% of the company’s reserves. Moreover, UPL’s share price does not reflect the purchase of an additional 80,000 acres of the valuable Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and Appalachia. Meanwhile, the company’s production rose by 27% in Q3. Cramer believes it’s time to sell most of the Chinese automotive stocks, especially those of China Automotive Systems (NASDAQ: CAAS), Wonder Auto Technology (NASDAQ: WATG) and China Yuchai International (NYSE: CYD). Cramer says that having run up an average of 400% since 2008, Chinese auto stocks are caught in yet another bubble that might burst soon. According to Cramer, their US counterparts Lear (NYSE: LEA), Johnson Controls (NYSE: JCI) and Magna International (NYSE: MGA) have miles to go before they run out of steam. Cramer Loves MO, FLIR, NUE; Finds Hard To Appreciate MNKD, UNG, BCRX In his Mad Money Lightning Round, Jim Cramer asked investors to stay away from MannKind (NASDAQ: MNKD) and BioCryst Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: BCRX). He believes that there is too much hype around these stocks. His sentiments were the same for United States Natural Gas (NYSE: UNG), which was termed as “the most dangerous ETF out there” by Cramer. While MNKD’s shares have surged 16.52%, BCRX dipped 1.97%. UNG’s shares also slid 2.61% to $10.09. Jim was enthusiastic about the accelerated growth exhibited by Altria (NYSE: MO). He said that MO has a 6% yield, which is pretty good. Cramer also asked investors to hold on to FLIR Systems (NASDAQ: FLIR), as it is a domestic-security play. While MO’s shares rose by 0.69%, FLIR’s shares lost 0.06%. Jim cautioned investors to stay away from CKX (NASDAQ: CKXE) due to its volatility. Nucor (NYSE: NUE) is the best domestic steel manufacturer in the market and should definitely be bought, Cramer added. CKXE’s shares tumbled 3.79% and NUE’s stock lost 1.07%."

BAC moved up 0.54% yesterday and has lost as much in pre-market trading. Cramer asks investors to refrain from investing in a steel company like United States Steel (NYSE: X) until there is news from Nucor (NYSE: NUE) later in the week. Meanwhile, when asked about Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ: ARLP), he tells investors to move out of coal. While X rose 2.24% and ARLP moved up 0.24%, NUE fell 0.14%. Although Cramer does not find Honda Motor (NYSE: HMC) a bad investment, he prefers Ford Motor (NYSE: F). While HMC lost 0.14%, F jumped 4.85%. On CenturyTel (NYSE: CTL), Jim comments that he loves companies that offer 8% yields and he would buy them in a jiffy. CTL gained 2.29% in yesterday’s trading.

2010-01-27,United Steel (X) Loses Third of its Value in 5 Sessions as Reality Finally Trumps Perception,"United Steel (X), along with any number of names of late ... Capital One Financial (COF), Harley Davidson (HOG) come to mind but I am seeing many other examples... showcase why the stock market is such a difficult place to ply a trade. The latter two stocks were names I was attempting to short summer 2009 after the cursory bounce in March 2009. By summer they had run up substantially, were no longer oversold, and were (in my opinion) over inflated in valuation based on what I viewed was reality in the economy. But the stock market is about perception & the playbook . The playbook said a wonderful economic recovery was coming because after a large drop in the economy, must come a substantial rebound. Everyone in the ivory tower says so, the textbooks say so - thus it must be. The exact same rigid thinking that had Ben Bernanke and most major Wall Street strategists miss almost this entire disaster. I, on the other hand, believed this was a government morphine laced printing press recovery and while of course we could not continue down into the abyss at the rate we were going (otherwise there would be no economy at all within a few years), investors were well ahead of themselves in their belief system. The US has massive structural problems, and people are confusing the cyclical oversold bounce in the economy (mostly caused by never before seen levels government spending) with some sort of grand recovery or a return to good times. As if a multi decade debt binge was solved in 15 months... all it takes is a Federal Reserve willing to throw every saver in the country under a bus, and a few changes in accounting rules for the banks. Problem solved. So these stocks bounced, and ran... and ran... and ran... and ran. Steam rolling anyone with my belief system. It really didn't matter if I was right eventually about the economy and this misguided belief system by the all knowing market. You still get steamrolled. It is almost a negative to have too far of a timeline in the stock market - because perception is reality in the intermediate to near term. If (almost) everyone believes in something, they will buy in anticipation of it. [Part of the reason I am in awe of the commodity rally - which institutions have piled into due to (ex China) some wonderful recovery coming - that's what the playbook says to do!]. It really does not matter at the time what the eventual outcome is when we arrive to the destination - the journey is the thing. I warned about this last spring but the disassociation surpassed all my expecations. [April 3, 2009: The Current (and Coming) Disassociation Between Wall Street and Main Street] I vastly understated the power of a printing press gone wild. While only the journey mattered back then, the destination ('the new normal') is around the corner and all those who bought in anticipation of a return to old normal are being disappointed. The performance of United Steel (X) - down 1/3rd in just 5 sessions - showcases what happens when reality trumps perception. But that is of little help to all those who RIGHTLY said these green shoots were mostly myth, and certainly had little to do with organic* strength in the US. *ex-government (by the way, if you are insistent that the economy is just fine - this is a place to put your chips on X as its right at long term support - with a tight stop loss of course) Even many of the companies trouncing their earnings estimates are doing so by the same method - cost cutting (slashing workforce), getting any strength via overseas or simply playing the lower expectations and then beat them game. I am reading the exact same data points in earnings report after earnings report among the larger players - US demand bounced off year ago lows and we're looking forward to more recovery in 2010 but have yet to see it. Inventory restocking happening.. Asia is almost back to pre 2008 levels, but United States nowhere close While industry is rebuilding inventories, we are seeing a lack of end demand in the US consumer I feel like I am reading the exact same earnings report over... and over... and over - with of course a few exceptions. These CEOs sound like an army of zombies repeating the same quotes. Point #4 above is so important to me - businesses are rebuilding inventories but without your end demand you have nothing. Most of US consumer end demand - outside the top 5-10% of the economic pay scale - comes now from direct bribes by government - buy cars, buy houses, here's a rebate check, go shop! Capital One Financial's CEO on the (still extremeley) indebted US consumer: The lack of consumer demand for credit, across our businesses, is striking, said Capital One Chief Executive Richard Fairbank during the company's earnings call late on Thursday. Perhaps the ever blunt CEO of Nucor (NUE), United Steel's competitor summarized it best: The fact is, the market stinks ... no product group, no product type, no end market is anywhere near back to where it was two years ago. Raw material costs are putting pressure on everybody. Yet steel stocks have rocketed for months on end.... because every guy on Wall Street has the same playbook. As have stocks in any other cyclical sector. Bottom line, don't believe the hype that the market is efficient or a great forward looking mechanism. What was it looking forward at in March 2000? Or October 2007? (When markets were at all time highs) The only thing the market is great at in the near term is acting as a wonderful group psychology experiment. As long as the lemmings all run in one direction holding hands in their belief (waving their textbooks high in the air) it doesn't matter if the market is right or wrong. You will get run over if you bet against them in the near term. Their perception is all our reality. The only problem is you just never know when reality finally trumps perception or textbooks. Which is why this is one difficult game - logic means little much of the time - and I marvel at how many stocks I bet against last summer are now facing reality. Our problems were not solved in 15 months... we have a long path of deleveraging ahead. To believe otherwise is to believe in fairy tales. Or CNBC pundits. No positions"
2010-01-28,Cramer Says Steel Sector Stuck Between A Rock And A Hard Place,"In his chat with Dan DiMicco, the CEO of Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Cramer said he liked NUE for its 3.4% dividend yield and had recommended it at $46. Although the stock is down 8% since then, investors have made a killing over the long-term, with ROE over the past ten years coming at 241% or 297% if they reinvested the dividend. Within the same period, the S&P 500 index has shrunk by 24%. Cramer said that the steel business seems to be stuck between a rock and a hard place, even as steel prices rise around the world, after the Chinese have put brakes on their economy. According to DiMicco, the recovery might be gradual, with the employment picture looking bleak and the Obama administration failing to create enough jobs in America. Cramer added that Obama’s role has become even more critical after the Chinese have taken steps to decelerate their overheated economy. Read more about Jim Cramer"
2010-01-28,"Mad Money Lightning Round: Jim All Out For NFLX, CHK, BWS, MT","In his “Mad Money Lightning Round, host Jim Cramer said that Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) has had a terrific quarter and it is going to go higher. Whosoever is bearish about the stock does not know about streaming video. NFLX was up 2.04% to close at $50.97. In after hours trading, NFLX soared 17.15% to $59.71. Jim gives a double thumbs up to Chesapeake Energy (NYSE: CHK), which he thinks is performing well. For Brown Shoe (NYSE: BWS), he says that it is historically undervalued and offers a terrific buy. CHK’s shares lost 2.26% to close at $25.93, while, BWS’s shares inched up 0.08% to close at $12.87.

2010-02-09,Mad Money: Cramer Says Semiconductor Stocks Back In Reckoning,"Jim told viewers of his Mad Money show that semiconductor stocks are back in reckoning after being trapped for a decade by the prevailing business cycles. He believes that analysts have failed to notice that both cyclical and secular growth trends are now turning in favor of the semis. After going through the conference calls of dozens of semiconductor stocks, he came to the conclusion that their impressive earnings were not simply the result of a recovery in the global economy. The long-term secular boom in digital gadgets, ranging from cell phones to e-book readers and from smart electric power to smarter cars, is also playing a key role in the semiconductor companies delivering blowout earnings. Jim believes that investors could have foreseen the impressive earnings beat at toymaker Hasbro (NYSE: HAS) if they had taken the company’s recent 25% dividend hike seriously. Cramer had recommended the stock on July 19 and since then the stock has moved up 38%. HAS jumped 12.69% in yesterday’s trading.

2010-05-10,Jim Says Best Strategy Is To Hold A Diversified Portfolio of High-Yielders,"According to an article on CNBC Jim Cramer believes that during this period of high volatility, investors can count on the ‘accidentally high-yielders.’ These are the same stocks that bailed out investors from the 2008 financial crisis. These shares belong to economically sensitive companies that otherwise pay low dividends until the market bottoms out. In a bearish market, the dividend yield of these companies shoots up as the share price falls “Not only can investors use that cash payout for a cushion against volatility, but the rising yield attracts still more investors to the stock, and that tends to buoy the share price,” Jim said. Take for instance Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE), which gave a dividend yield of 5% at some point during the crash. The stock normally doesn’t yield that much and, hence, a good strategy would have been to buy the stock for its dividend payout and gain through it until the stock price rebounds. This would result in a two-way income, first from the dividend yield and later from the appreciated share price. Investors need to maintain a diversified portfolio of such high dividend yielders, Cramer emphasized. One such diversified group may contain Altria (NYSE: MO), AT&T (NYSE: T) and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (NYSE: KMP), offering nearly 7% yield, along with Plum Creek Timber (NYSE: PCL) and DuPont, both of which yield 4.4%.

2010-05-26,Base Metals Likely To Jump On Demand From China,"According to an article on TheStreet, buying opportunities created by metal sell-offs over the past two weeks will trigger gains in base metals during this week. Europe's debt woes and China's property concerns are likely to result in continued volatility in the markets. However, buying sentiment in the markets has further improved, led by speculation of a rise in Chinese demand, the South Korean government’s announcement to hold talks with North Korea to reduce tensions in the region and upgrades by Citigroup (NYSE: C) on metal stock. An expansion in China's demand for base metals is foreseen by the world's third-largest mining company Rio Tinto (NYSE: RTP). According to RTP’s CEO Tom Albanese, the demand for iron ore, aluminum and copper is going to double over the next 15 years. Yesterday in RTP’s annual general meeting, Chairman Jan du Plessis said, China's demand for iron ore, copper, coal and aluminum is expected to grow over the next 15 years, after which time we expect to see increasing demand from India. The long-term outlook, therefore, continues to make our business an attractive proposition. Analyst Brian Yu of Citigroup has confidence that metal stocks offer good value. He upped its rating for AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) to “buy” as he believes that price correction in the stock is overdone. However, Brian cut the earnings and price targets for the stock. By 1:07 pm, AKS had dropped 2.19% to $14.73. According to Yu, the base metal stocks that offer the maximum upside to investors include copper giant Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (NYSE: FCX), iron ore miner Cliff Resources (NYSE: CLF) and scrap-metal recycler Nucor (NYSE: NUE). By 1:07 pm, FCX had climbed 1.21% to $68.44, CLF had rallied 4.10% to $53.80 and NUE had appreciated 1.17% to $43.48. To see more trading ideas, click here."

2010-06-21,"Playing Long-Term Global Growth in the Steel Sector (CPSL, NUE, X, AKS)","While some pundits debate the possibility of a worldwide, double dip recession, it is hard to disregard facts; so lets look at some facts that relate to worldwide growth in the steel sector. 1. China continues to grow at a 10% yearly rate. 2. India continues to grow at 6% per year. 3. Steel demand from those two countries, according to Credit Suisse, is now running at pre-2008 crash levels 4. The president of the China Iron and Steel Association (CISA), Deng Qilin, stated on February 5 that apparent consumption of crude steel in China is expected to grow by 8-10 percent in 2010. 5. Worldwide steel production is ebbing and will be headed lower 6. Major producers are beginning to liquidate inventory (which is typically a contrarian’s indicator) All these metrics point to the same thesis: steel producers with profitable business metrics will outperform the market in the long-term if bought on short-term weakness. The key is finding steel producers with the highest return on capital, the highest gross margin, and very low debt levels. If you look at many of the major steel producers, such as U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE), and AK Steel (NYSE: AKS), you will see that none of them has positive returns on assets or capital, most do not have a positive return on equity either. Furthermore, many of these companies have low gross margins (AK Steel excluded) and negative earnings. Add on the fact that these companies’ debt levels are among the highest in the industry and you have strike three. So the search is on for a company that is the polar opposite of the above companies—China Precision Steel (NASDAQ: CPSL). China Precision Steel, which produces and sells precision ultra-thin and high strength cold-rolled steel products, has some of the highest return on assets/equity/capital (4%, 5.4%, and 5.4%, respectively) of any steel company, a profit margin and gross margin higher than 90% of the industry (6.55% and 10.10%, respectively), and has a super low debt/equity ratio of 0.21x. This is also the only company I can find with all three of those key metrics. CPSL’s revenue and earnings growth is also greater than 90% of the industry; they are scheduled to grow 16% per year for the next five years. The stock is scheduled to make $0.19 next year, giving the company an 8.52 P/E, which is lower than all the above companies. Coupled with that sizable growth rate, that gives CPSL a PEG ratio of just 0.53, which means it is HUGELY undervalued. On a technical basis, the stock has sold off heavily over the past year, off from a high near $3.30, fully reflecting the market’s concerns about worldwide growth. Though the stock is not as low as its 2008 level ($0.86), this still represents a value, as investors are now able to see that the world is not falling apart completely. The company’s cash flow is hovering around the flat line (though skewing positive in recent quarters), though much of this year’s negative flows have been the company ridding themselves of long-term debt and picking up fixed-assets, which will bode well for them as demand continues to increase. I rate the stock as a Strong Buy, and will be picking up shares of CPSL around $1.50-1.60. This is a five-year play with a price target north $3.00 (100% return, 20% return annum)."

Pearson PLC (ADR) (NYSE: PSO) is a buy, thinks Cramer.

2010-08-31,Metals and Mining Review - Sept. 2010 - Industry Outlook,"Overview The Metals & Mining Industry encompasses the extraction (mining), as well as the primary and secondary processing of metals and minerals such as aluminum, gold, precious metals, coal and steel. The industry is oligarchic in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion’s share of the output. The largest segment of the global metals market is iron and steel, followed by aluminum. The iron and steel segment comprises more than half the industry in terms of volume. This industry includes metal ore exploration and mining services, iron and steel foundries for smelting, rolling, forging, spinning, recycling, stamping, polishing and plating of iron and steel products such as pipes, tubes, wire, spring, rolls and bars. Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal (MT), the world’s largest steel producing company, produced 73.2 million tons in 2009, representing 6% of the world's steel output. The precious metal and mineral industry consists of companies engaged in the extraction and primary processing of gold, silver, platinum, diamond, semi-precious stones, uranium and other rare minerals and ores, along with the cultivation of pearls. Anglo American Plc., the largest gold producer by market capitalization, dominates the gold industry. Historically, the automotive and construction markets have been the largest consumers of metals, accounting for more than 50% of total demand. Other metal consumers include energy, electrical equipment, agricultural, domestic and commercial equipment and industrial machinery. Large automakers such as General Motors Corporation (GM), Ford Motor Company (F), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) and Honda Motor Company (HMC) are big consumers of metals, chiefly steel and aluminum. Outlook The global metal industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity (excess of supply over demand). Metal producers are subject to cyclical fluctuations in London Metal Exchange prices, general economic conditions and end-use markets. Individual company profitability depends on volume and operating efficiency. Large producers with huge resources are able to discover, develop new deposits and boost reserves, while smaller ones own few mines and concentrate on them. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) has historically been a critically important growth strategy for metal companies. While the slow economic recovery is a significant factor in short-term decisions regarding M&A activity, mining companies expect to make acquisitions over the next three years. The M&A activity is also supported by higher metal prices that have strengthened the financial positions of many mining giants. Geographically, the Asia-Pacific region is witnessing higher production and consumption of metals, especially China and India. Per capita consumption levels in both these countries are calibrating to U.S./European levels, which could -- theoretically, at least -- double metal demand in the longer term. In recent years, capacity growth in China has significantly exceeded the growth in market demand. A continuation of this unbalanced growth trend or a significant decrease in China’s rate of economic expansion could result in the country increasing its metal exports. Yet, we expect global metal demand to improve in the long term with the recovery of user industries. Developed regions such as the US and Europe are showing signs of recovery. Despite some concerns about its sustainability, China is expected to remain the largest consumer of metals in the future. Metals in Detail: Steel As the major shareholder (about 60%) in the metals market, the steel industry was strongly affected by the global economic downturn. Massive over-capacity is one of the major headwinds for steel, which continues to weigh on prices. Moreover, the industry has witnessed a number of trade disputes involving the U.S., in particular, the imposition of tariffs of up to 30% on imported steel. Rising raw material prices -- iron ore and coal (metallurgical) -- are also a major concern for the steel industry. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS), for instance, expects a 65% rise in benchmark iron ore prices in the near term. Demand in key metal consuming industries such as autos, shipbuilding and construction, continues to remain weak, forcing global metal producers to slacken output levels. While utilization levels have improved recently, steel makers were operating at less than 50% capacity last year. U.S. Steel Corporation (X) -- the eighth largest steel producer in the world, the largest integrated steel producer headquartered in North America and one of the largest integrated flat-rolled producers in Central Europe -- slashed production by almost 37% in 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO (PKX) had to scale down output by about 10.9%. Steel demand is reviving slowly, with improving end-markets on the back of a recovering global economy. Steel giant ArcelorMittal and U.S. Steel are restarting furnaces or are planning to in the near future. Industry steel mill utilization rates have increased to above 70%. The current high in steel demand helped reverse losses for the third largest steel maker Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) and the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S., Nucor Corporation (NUE). Steel Dynamics’ second-quarter earnings of 22 cents reversed losses of 8 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, Nucor reported a profit of 29 cents per share in the second quarter of 2010, in contrast to a net loss of 43 cents per share in the same quarter of 2009. The World Steel Association expects a 10.7% increase in global steel demand this year and a further 5.3% gain in 2011 compared to 2010 level. The impetus is mostly expected from a surge in Chinese steel demand, which is likely to grow 6.7% to 579 million tons in 2010. But despite these improving trends, average selling prices are still struggling, as the pace of recovery in the U.S. and global markets is slow at best. The ongoing slowdown has marred prospects in the housing and construction sectors in the near term. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS), Nucor and Steel Dynamics have provided a bleak overall near-term price outlook, although they expect end-markets to stabilize. Collectively, AK Steel, Nucor and ArcelorMittal have a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) for the short-term (1 to 3 months), while we maintain our Neutral recommendation in the long term for all three, given the outlook for steel. However, Steel Dynamics holds a Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell) and has a long-term Underperform recommendation driven by a very weak earnings outlook. Gold The outlook for investment is positive overall, with absolute levels of demand likely to remain well supported by continued economic and currency uncertainty, inflation concerns and the search for diversification. In 2009, global gold supply exceeded demand by 15%, reflecting favorable gold prices. However, based on the marginal improvement in the economic environment in 2010, the World Gold Council expects an increase in demand for jewelry, which in turn will help global gold demand. A potential shot in the arm for the precious metal is the expected increase in central bank gold holdings, primarily as a diversification play. The value and wealth preservation attributes of gold continue to attract investors and consumers. Jewelry and investment demand in non-western markets continues to rebound from the low levels in 2009, while industrial demand has started to recover in response to an improvement in economic conditions. India, which alone consumes nearly 45%−50% of the world gold production, should drive demand for gold along with China in the next half of 2010. Chinese gold demand is expected to double in 10 years. Concerns over the recent European debt crisis have also led to strong buying of gold coins, bars and gold exchange traded funds in particular. We saw gold demand and prices strengthen in the first six months of 2010, a trend that is likely to remain in place in the rest of the year. Higher prices bode well for gold producers, which should benefit giants such as Barrick Gold (ABX), Agnico-Eagle (AEM) and Goldcorp Inc. (GG). However, gold producers Newmont Mining (NEM) and Kinross Gold Corporation (KGC) suffer from lower ore grades that subdue production levels, increase mining costs and offset the benefits of rising gold prices. Overall, the stock prices of gold producers are not expected to benefit much from this overall favorable commodity-price backdrop. This is reflected in our overall neutral view on the space. Aluminum The aluminum industry is highly cyclical, with prices subject to worldwide supply and demand forces along with other influences. Aluminum prices at the LME have plunged around 20% from their April highs to $1,969 per ton. The greatest risk for aluminum producers would be a further decline in aluminum prices. However, we expect aluminum demand to increase in the long term, outstripping supply growth with the improving end-markets. Leading aluminum producers such as Alcoa Inc. (AA), Paramount Gold and Silver Corporation (PZG) and Aluminum Corporation of China (ACH) should benefit from the improving demand outlook. In the medium to long term, Alcoa expects aluminum consumption to improve globally with improving automotive and packaging industries, one of the key consumer markets. Aluminum is widely used for packaging, beverage cans, food containers and foil products. The automobile market is also becoming increasingly aluminum intensive, benefiting from the recyclability and the light weight of the metal. Alcoa now expects demand to grow about 10% to 12% in 2010. The aluminum giant predicts Chinese aluminum consumption to jump 21% and about 6.5% globally (excluding China) in 2010. Currently, Alcoa, Paramount Gold and Silver and Aluminum Corporation of China hold a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) supported by a long-term Neutral recommendation. Copper Copper prices started on a downtrend in early July 2010 and are expected to remain volatile in the near term, which could be a major headwind for copper companies. Revenues and margins for copper producers like Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) and Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO) were affected by the recent fall in copper prices and volumes, primarily driven by the slowing economic activities in China. However, the long-term view is favorable. Market conditions are expected to be positive for copper in the next couple of years due to higher consumption of the metal in the developing nations. Copper companies that have a high leverage to copper prices will benefit immensely from the potential demand in copper in the developing markets. The near-term headwinds led to the short-term Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) and Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) on Freeport and Southern Copper, respectively. However, both companies have a Neutral recommendation on a positive long-term outlook.

2010-09-07,Neutral on Nucor Corp. - Analyst Blog,"We reiterate our Neutral recommendation on Nucor Corporation (NUE). Nucor Corporation, the nation’s largest recycler of steel scrap, is facing higher costs in scrap and scrap substitute prices, which is the most significant elements in the total cost of steel production. Lower production rates at the mills have slowed the rate at which they consume the higher cost iron units, in particular pig iron inventories. However, pig iron consumption had increased midway through 2009. Moreover, a slowdown in demand from the housing and construction sector and increased production in China are matters of concern. However, long-term contracts, cost-reduction efforts and a dominant acquisition strategy could benefit the company in the coming quarters. Nucor’s focus has been on profitable growth through acquisitions over the past several years. It is aiming at utilizing cash aggressively for accretive acquisitions. The annual capacity of Nucor’s downstream value-added products has more than doubled since late 2006 to over 4.5 million tons with the acquisitions of Verco Manufacturing Company in steel decking; Harris Steel Group Inc. in rebar fabrication, cold finished bars and metal grating; LMP Steel & Wire Company in cold finished bars; Magnatrax Corporation in metal buildings; and Nelson Steel Inc. in wire mesh. Harris alone has increased Nucor’s rebar fabrication capacity to over 1.5 million tons. We are also positive on Nucor’s recent joint venture with Mitsui, which would help Nucor grow internationally. In addition, Nucor’s strong balance sheet positions the company well for the long term, but the near-term headwinds in the end-markets are likely to make it difficult for the stock to outperform. Although end-markets are stabilizing, average selling prices are still struggling as the pace of recovery in the U.S. and global markets is quite slow. Additionally, massive industry over-capacity continues to weigh on steel prices. The ongoing slowdown has marred prospects in the housing and construction sectors in the near term. As such, there is a bleak overall near-term price outlook. Currently, shares of Nucor Corporation are trading at 35.5x our 2010 EPS estimate, compared with the 22.4x for the peer group and 13.6x for the S&P 500. Over the last five years, Nucor’s shares have traded in a range of 5.2x to 81.5x trailing 12-month earnings. Our long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock indicates that it would perform in line with the market. Our $41.00 target price, 37.6x 2010 EPS, reflects this view.

2010-09-08,3 Sectors That Would Benefit From Another Stimulus Bill,"Congress is currently discussing another stimulus package. This one would not be like the first package which was loaded with tax cuts and spending on healthcare, information technology, and education. This package would go directly to improving our bridges, highways, dams, and tunnels. If Congress does pass a $50 billion dollar infrastructure stimulus bill, these are the sectors that would benefit the most. Industrial stocks Chicago Bridge & Iron (CBI), Jacobs Engineering (JEG), Foster Wheeler (FWLT), and Manitowoc (MTW) are a few of my favorite companies in this sector. These companies have their hands in every stage of the construction and engineering process. Both firms would benefit substantially from an infrastructure stimulus package. Materials Manufacturer Stocks Vulcan Materials(VMC), Eagles Materials (EXP), Martin Marietta (MLM), and Astex Industries (ASTE) all produce the materials that are used for industrial and commercial construction. These materials are used to cementing and asphalting roads and highways. Metals Producer Stocks The federal government may issue the money but they can’t complete their projects without basic materials. Steel will be needed from the nation’s largest steel producers. That includes companies like U.S. Steel (X), AK Steel (AKS), Nuecor (NUE) and Mittal Steel (MT). The first stimulus plan should have had more spending in the infrastructure arena. Although this plan is only for $50 billion dollars, it should help tp boost the revenues of many of these companies. It may be abit late but I suppose that something is better than nothing at all.

The estimated quarterly LIFO charge is higher than the charge of $45.5 million anticipated at the time we gave our qualitative guidance."
2010-09-15,"Watch Out U.S. Steel, You Might Be Next (AKS, STLD, X)","AK Steel (NYSE: AKS), Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) all recently lowered their earnings expectations for the third quarter, due to higher input costs, lower sales prices, and a blast furnace outage at AK's Ashland furnace. How does this look for U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) and its shareholders? It's a mix at this point, with more negative points than good at this time. One positive for U.S. Steel the higher input costs, as X owns their own iron ore plants, a significant cost of making steel. AK and Steel Dynamics do not, and thus have less control over their input costs than U.S. Steel does. That's about it for the positives. The negatives seem to far outweigh the lone positive at this point, with slowdowns in construction spending, lower sales prices among the reasons to blame. Another negative is the price of scrap metal, which has been rising as the automobile industry slowed down over the summer months, easing the oversupply of scrap metal, and thus causing the price to rise. In a statement released yesterday, Nucor said, Our third-quarter results will unfortunately confirm these concerns and a general slowdown has indeed occurred from the second quarter, particularly in our flat-rolled business. I would expect U.S. Steel to echo the same sentiments of its competitors, and lower its earnings outlook for the third quarter. Shares of X have fallen in recent days on the lowered outlooks from its competitors, so shares may not fall too much further. Since the beginning of the week, shares have fallen approximately 4%, about in line with its competitors on the weakened outlook. Investors and traders should be aware that the next shoe is about to drop, and X marks the spot this time. Disclosure: long X See more real-time trading ideas Here"
2010-09-15,Nucor's Muted Outlook - Analyst Blog,"Shares of Nucor Corporation (NUE), the largest recycler of steel scrap in the US, fell 3.07% or $1.25 and closed at $39.41 on September 14, 2010 after projecting a weak third quarter 2010 guidance. Nucor stated that the ongoing slowdown across its product lines, especially in the flat rolled business in the backdrop of an economic uncertainty would get reflected in the third quarter results. Residential and non-residential construction markets remain challenging for Nucor's downstream businesses. Nucor is also likely to record huge inventory charges. The steel maker projects third quarter 2010 earnings within $0.05 to $0.10 per share significantly down from 29 cents and 10 cents in the second quarter and first quarter of 2010, respectively. The company attributed weak margins to higher scrap costs and the inability to transfer these price increases to customers. However, earnings are expected to reverse year-ago losses of 10 cents per share. When adjusted for inventory charges, the company expects third quarter earnings to beat first quarter income but remain behind the second quarter. The projected third quarter earnings are substantially below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents with a downside potential of 9.68%. Historically, Nucor has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate as reflected by the average surprise of 54.47%. Steel scrap prices have been surging driven by increased production in China and other emerging economies. The ongoing economic slowdown has marred prospects in the housing and construction sectors in the near term. All these taken together make situations gloomy for Nucor. However, long-term contracts, cost reduction efforts and a dominant acquisition strategy could benefit the company in the coming quarters. We are optimistic on Nucor's growing presence in the international market. In addition, Nucor's strong balance sheet provides with long-term security, but the near-term headwinds in the end-markets are likely to stifle the stock's growth. Although end-markets are stabilizing, average selling prices are still struggling as the pace of recovery in the U.S. and global markets is quite slow. Additionally, massive industry over-capacity continues to weigh on steel prices. As such, there is a bleak overall near-term price outlook. Analysts and investors are negative on Nucor in the near-term, which is reflected in the short-term (1 to 3 months) Zacks #4 Rank (“Sell”). For longer-term (6+ months), Nucor has a Neutral recommendation. NUCOR CORP (NUE): Free Stock Analysis Report Zacks Investment Research"
2010-09-16,AK Steel Slashes 3Q Guidance - Analyst Blog,"Shares of steel maker AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) slipped 5.71% or 83 cents and closed at $13.70 on September 15, 2010 after the company forecasted operating losses in the third quarter of 2010. AK Steel foresees operating losses of $20 per ton in the third quarter in contrast to its previous guidance of $15 per ton of operating profits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at a loss of 2 cents. AK Steel attributed the estimated loss primarily to the cost related with the planned maintenance shutdown of the Ashland facility in Kentucky. The blast furnace in Kentucky was scheduled to be under maintenance in the first half of 2011. However, bad furnace conditions forced AK steel to prepone the maintenance. The company plans an 11 day production outage at the facility starting from September 20, 2010. Besides, AK Steel expects soaring iron-ore prices, the key raw material for steel production, to further increase to the company's operating losses in the third quarter. Earlier, in its second quarter 2010 earnings release, AK Steel had forecasted a 65% year over year increase in iron prices in 2010. Although the company remains uncertain about the raw material prices, it expects increasing demand in China and other foreign markets to push iron prices to an exorbitant level. AK Steel stated that an every 5% increase in iron price above 65% would affect results by $11 million or $7 per ton. In last couple of days, two other steel makers, Nucor Corporation (NUE) and Steel Dynamics (STLD) slashed their third quarter 2010 guidance citing global economic uncertainty. Nucor, the nations largest scrap recycler stated that rising demand in emerging economies, especially China has triggered the scrap costs to rise above expected level. The company is also facing a weak domestic demand environment that partially offsets the benefits of increasing international demand. The steel maker projects third quarter 2010 earnings within $0.05 to $0.10 per share significantly down from 29 cents and 10 cents in the second quarter and first quarter of 2010, respectively. The projected third quarter earnings are substantially below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents with a downside potential of 9.68%. Similarly, Steel Dynamics, one of the leading steel producers in the US forecasts a bleak third quarter 2010 due to a subdued performance in the Steel segment. It foresees net earnings of a meager 5 cents to 10 cents per share. Lower selling prices particularly in the sheet and structural steel operations would reduce net earnings substantially from last year's net earnings of 30 cents. Projected third quarter results would be a significant 54% decline from the second quarter 2010 earnings of 22 cents and would underperform the Zacks Consensus as well. We believe third quarter 2010 could be depressing for the steel industry as a whole with already three steel producers slashing guidance. Things would surface better with further outlook updates from other major steel makers including United States Steel (X) and Arcelor Mittal (MT).

2010-09-16,"Have Steel Stocks Bottomed? (NUE, STLD, AKS, X)","First came Nucor (NYSE: NUE). Then came Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD). Then came AKS Steel (NYSE: AKS). One by one, these U.S. steelmakers lowered their guidance for the third quarter. Nucor cited weak demand in the construction sector, Steel Dynamics said results would be hurt by reduced margins and lower sales prices, AK Steel cited higher iron ore costs that would crimp its earnings. The steel industry has had a sluggish recovery due to the fact its biggest customer is the non-residential construction sector, which has yet to rebound. However, after trading lower much of this week, all three names are higher today, suggesting that a near-term bottom may be in place as the negative news has been discounted. Nucor is up 0.10%, Steel Dynamics is higher by 1.22%, and AK Steel is up 1.02%. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), which did not give a third-quarter earnings warning, is higher by 1.59%."
2010-09-17,Two Simple Strategies to Build Your Confidence,"It appears for a second - then vanishes forever. I'm talking about something called a ghost order. It's when an institutional trader - or computer trading by proxy - enters an order and immediately cancels it. Even though stock orders are frequently submitted and then cancelled, order books still record the event. And these order books are now being increasingly scrutinized to see if they represent an unfair advantage created by those placing the order. As if high-frequency trading firms need another advantage. Let's face it - they already have wires that directly connect their computers to those on the major exchanges in order to have the fastest order routing. The practice by high-frequency traders to place and cancel orders in milliseconds has come back under scrutiny by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and for good reason. These traders, who typically make up the majority of trading volume in any given day, wield incredible power. If you didn't read about this earlier this week and recognize it for what it is - a discussion of the fundamental operating structure of publicly traded stocks - then you absolutely need to read on. Everything I'm going to say directly relates to how you buy and sell small cap stocks - and other securities for that matter, so even if I start techno-babbling, fight through your desire to gaze out the window and dream of what you'll do this weekend to celebrate the official end to summer. You need to understand how our electronic markets work, or at least how they should. If you have this knowledge, you can recognize great buying opportunities, and also recognize when the market is trying to suck you in, take all your money, and spit you out. In the old manual market structure, the market participants with the best access to the markets -- the specialists and the dominant exchanges -- were subject to significant trading obligations, said SEC Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro in Bloomberg Businessweek. These traditional obligations have fallen by the wayside. The question is how to regulate those with the best access to the markets. While Schapiro recognized that, There may, of course, be justifiable explanations for many canceled orders to reflect changing market conditions, U.S. Senator Charles Schumer counters: When thousands of orders are sent and canceled in a fraction of a second, it is clear that those orders were never intended to be executed. They're both doing the dance, suggesting that this practice needs to be looked at but recognizing that a dramatic re-tooling of the current order entry system could be disruptive to markets, especially since the consensus - established long before this debate ensued - is that greater liquidity in markets leads to more precise price discovery. Now I could go into the definitions of transparency that institutions like the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) suggest to help determine fair value. These differentiate 'quoted prices', from 'observable values' from 'unobservable values'. These accounting terms are used to determine fair value for financial instruments with varying levels of liquidity and transparency. I'd like you to finish reading this letter so I'll sum it up in one sentence. Fair value is what you can get for something you want to sell - period. The more buying and selling that occurs, the more accurate the price. This concept is what spurred the move toward electronic trading. And I think the concept is sound. But High-frequency traders claim that they benefit the markets by providing significant additional liquidity...Much of the supposed liquidity is not real, says Schumer. After the May 6 'flash crash' the SEC has tried to implement trading stops on stocks that move too far, too fast. One of the things that happened on that day was that stub quotes, which are orders that brokers place in the market to fulfill their stated obligation to buy and sell stock, went through for fractions of what the stock had been trading at just minutes before. Bloomberg reports that on May 6 the selloff erased $862 billion from the value of U.S. equities in less than 20 minutes. A preliminary report published in May by the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission found liquidity dried up when it was needed most. So we put this problem behind us right? Well, not quite. On Tuesday of this week shares of Nucor (NYSE: NUE) triggered a trading halt on the CBOE when a 100 share order went through for $0.01, a far cry from the mid thirty-dollar price the stock had been trading at just minutes before. It was a case where the incoming large market order simply walked our book down to that last order, said David Harris, the president and chief executive of CBSX. This discussion is far from over as the SEC will continue to review the practice by trading firms to place stub quotes. In the meantime, what should we do to position ourselves to take advantage of fast moving markets and protect our capital at the same time? Two things: First, use manual stop losses for your stocks. What I mean by that is don't have a stop loss order placed in the market - if you do and a stock 'flashes' down, you could be closed out of the position when you really didn't want to be. If you have a manual stop which the stock closes below at the end of the day, evaluate the position and sell it the next trading day. This gives you the chance to evaluate what is truly going on with the stock - not just what is going on with the electronic order process. Second, do the exact opposite with buy orders. Have buy orders in for the stocks you want to buy at prices far below the currently traded price. These are your dream buys - I'm talking 20, 30, even 50 percent or more below the currently traded price. If the stock flashes down, you may have your order filled and pick up shares in a company that essentially went on sale for one day. Both of these strategies will help you feel more confident about how you buy and sell stocks because by following them you're recognize the reality of the situation - and both protect yourself from abnormalities, while taking advantage of them. In short, you're aligning your interests in a way that takes advantage of the inefficiencies inherent to how the market operates. I use both of these strategies in Small Cap Investor PRO and Ian Wyatt's $100K Portfolio, saving subscribers from selling stocks that have rebounded above my manual stop-loss in intra-day trading. I've also picked up shares of stocks in Ian Wyatt's $100K Portfolio when they fell to a level at which I had already decided I wanted to own them. Try these strategies out - they might not work today, tomorrow, or even next month. But when they do, you'll feel more like a Wall Street Insider who's in control of your own money than like a home-gamer who's getting played by the big dogs. It'll increase your confidence, and your returns. At the end of the day, that's what it's all about. Check out Small Cap Investor PRO here and Ian Wyatt's $100K Portfolio here. And let me know how you feel about these stub orders, and high frequency trading. Are you in favor of it or against it? Write to editorial@smallcapinvestor.com."

2010-10-01,Market Keeps Chugging Along  10-01-2010,"Cusick's Corner Some readers have told me that I have been posting the same three sentences in the Corner over the past 5 sessions. (Thanks for the insight Dad, and you are right.) The market in general has been defying the odds, just keeps chugging along. What was interesting yesterday was the stiff resistance in the S&Ps at 1150 and in the Euro 1.37, with some selling that seemed relentless for a very short and violent period of time. The only segment that has not met any resistance is Gold and that is a freight train that you do not want to get in front of, especially with the continued uncertainty of Sovereign Debt and slow economic growth. If you are bullish, the spread strategy may be the route to go, especially if volatility starts to pick up, spreads may better mitigate volatility risk. Plus if the market shifts direction to the downside, then the spread has reduced premium risk over trading individual options. In the end, when trading a spread you have mitigated time, price and volatility risk to a large degree but the trade-off is that you limit your profit potential. See you After Hours. Major averages are mixed despite a round of mostly positive economic news Friday. Data released before the opening bell showed August personal incomes and spending up .5 percent and .4 percent, respectively. Economists were looking for more modest gains of .3 percent in both spending and incomes. Separate numbers released later showed the University of Michigan Sentiment Index finishing September at 68.2, up from 66.6 and better than the 67.0 that economists had predicted. A third report showed Construction Spending up .4 percent in August, and also better than the -.5 percent that had been forecast. The ISM index fell a bit short of expectations, however. The gauge of manufacturing activity fell to 54.4 in September, down from 56.3 and below estimates of 54.8. Overall, however, the data didn't stir much of a reaction and the underlying tone seems somewhat cautious as we enter the historically volatile month of October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 32 points but the NASDAQ lost 1.6. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) slipped .60 to 23.16. Options trading is slowing a bit ahead of the weekend. Approximately 4.2 million calls and 3.5 million puts traded by 1:00 ET. Bullish MBIA (MBI) shares are up and call options are busy Friday. Shares of the New York surety and title insurance company gained 22 cents to $10.27. Meanwhile, options volume is 5X the average daily and being led by a buyer of 20,000 January 12.5 calls at 53 cents each. Later, another investor bought 4,100 at 53 cents and another block of 8,500 was bought at 57 cents per contract. 34,700 January 12.5 calls now traded in MBIA. Powershares US Dollar Fund (UUP) lost 18 cents to $22.66 and options volume is 4X the average daily after one block of 20,000 January 24 calls traded at the 22-cent ask price. Another block of 4,429 traded at 22 cents as well. 28,500 contracts have now traded on this exchange-traded fund. Since UUP tracks the performance of the buck against the Euro, Japanese Yen, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Krona and Swiss Franc, buying calls on the fund represents a bullish bet on the US currency. Bearish Market Vectors Russia Fund (RSX) is seeing action Friday morning. Shares are up 72 cents to $33.25, as Russia's oil dependent economy might stand to benefit from the recent uptick in crude oil prices. Crude is up $1.20 to $81.17 a barrel Friday. Meanwhile, in RSX trading seems somewhat defensive, however, after options volume hit 3X the average daily. 6,115 puts and 725 calls traded on the fund through midday. The action includes two blocks of 2,500 and 2,000 November 29 puts, apparently bought at 30 and 35 cents. Put volume is picking up on NASDAQ OMX Group (OMX). Shares of the stock and options exchange are off a dime to $19.33 and options volume is 7.5X the recent average daily, with 4,760 puts and 420 calls traded so far. The put volume represents 12X the typical volume for NDAQ. March 18 puts are the most actives, with 3,590 trades. The action looks possibly like hedging activity on concerns about weakness in the share price over the next two quarters.

Reported earnings, however, reversed the year-ago losses of $29.5 million or 10 cents per share. A difficult pricing and end-market demand scenario impacted both revenues and margins. Although Nucor posted sound year-over-year revenue numbers, they faltered sequentially. Revenues Quarterly sales shot up 33% to $4.1 billion and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.9 billion. Revenues were driven by a 20% spike in average realized prices and a 10% rise in total shipments. Steel shipments were up 9% while downstream steel products sales volumes increased 5% year over year. Revenues declined 1% quarter over quarter due to a 3% fall in average realized prices, partially offset by a 1% increase in shipments. During the third quarter, Nucor operated its steel facilities at 68% of its total capacity, which was down from 71% in the second quarter of 2010. Capacity utilization rate of 71% in the first nine-month of 2010 was higher than 53% in the same period of the previous year. Costs During the quarter, cost of sales accelerated by 32% to $3.9 billion. Average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton fell 5% to $354. Nucor recorded a charge to value inventories using the last-in, first-out method of $50 million, compared with a credit of $120 million in the third quarter of 2009. Total energy costs increased about $4 per ton from the third quarter of 2009. Pre-operating and start-up costs of new facilities were $41.9 million compared with $47.1 million in the third quarter of 2009. Liquidity Nucor's liquidity position remained strong at the end of the quarter. The company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.01 billion as of September 30, 2010. It has an unused $1.3 billion revolving credit facility that matures in November 2012. Guidance Nucor is negatively affected by a slowdown across all its product lines due to uncertainty in the overall economy. The most challenging markets for its products are associated with residential and non-residential construction. Moreover, overcapacity in the global steel industry has forced the steel manufacturers to export steel and steel products at prices below their cost of production, which are expected to negatively affect their profitability. As a result, we continue to recommend the shares as Sell (Zacks #5 Rank) in the short term. NUCOR CORP (NUE): Free Stock Analysis Report Zacks Investment Research"

2010-10-29,Steel Industry Outlook - Nov. 2010 - Industry Outlook,"The U.S. houses one of the world's largest steel industries. It is rather concentrated in structure, with a few producers accounting for the lion's share of sales. ArcelorMittal (MT) is the world's largest steel company, with crude steel production of 73.2 million tons in 2009, representing about 6% of the global steel output. Steel products are classified into four broad categories: flat steel products, long steel products, scrap and semi-finished products. Flat products include plates, hot-rolled strip and sheets, and cold-rolled strip and sheets. The long steel product category comprises wire rods, beams, reinforced bars and merchant bars. The products under both these categories are rolled from steel slabs, which are considered as unfinished or semi-finished products that are generally not sold. Historically, the automotive and construction markets have remained the largest consumers of steel, absorbing more than half of the total steel produced. Large automakers such as General Motors (MTLQQ), Ford Motor Company (F), Toyota Motor Corporation (TM) and Honda Motor Company (HMC) depend upon the steel industry. Other steel consuming industries include appliances, agricultural implements, converters, containers, energy, electrical equipment and industrial machinery. Growth Trends Accelerating demand in the automobile and construction markets triggered production growth in the steel industry before the recession hit. However, the global economic turmoil that started at the end of 2008 and continued through much of 2009 severely impacted both these markets, with the demand for steel nose-diving as a consequence. Steel manufacturers saw inventories soaring and scrambled to cut production. With the global economy picking up in late 2009, the steel industry started seeing signs of improvement. However, given its economic sensitivity, we expect global steel demand to improve only gradually, in line with the recovery in the user industries, especially automotive and residential construction. According to World Steel Association (“worldsteel”), steel demand in the U.S. was down 41.6% in 2009 at 57.4 million tons. However, with the economy in recovery mode, the industrial sector is expected to drive a 26.5% increase in steel demand in the U.S. in 2010 and a further 7.5% in 2011 to 78.1 million tons. The emerging economies reflected growth trends throughout the recession and are expected to continue to drive steel demand, going forward. Worldsteel expects steel demand in India to grow 13.9% and 13.7% in 2010 and 2011, respectively, following a growth of 7.7% in 2009. The European Union experienced a 35.2% decline in steel demand in 2009. Spain and Italy saw a significant fall in steel production with the breakdown of their construction market. According to the association, in 2010 the European region will see an increase of 13.7% in steel demand, driven by the restocking of inventory. Japan would see steel demand rising 10.3% in 2010 after a 31.7% fall in 2009. However, worldsteel expects Chinese steel consumption to increase by a modest 6.7% to 579 million tons in 2010, after an impressive 24.8% increase in 2009. Expansionary Chinese economic policies, easy credit and construction initiatives have thus far sustained demand. But with China attempting to rein in its overheated property sector and engineer a soft landing for its economy, steel demand will most likely soften noticeably in the coming months. Globally, worldsteel anticipates steel demand to rise 10.7% to 1,241 million tons in 2010 in contrast to last year's decline of 6.7%. For 2011, worldsteel expects global steel requirement to inch up 5.3% to 1,306 million tons. Production Scenario The year 2010 started well for the steel industry, with improving demand conditions in several end markets, leading to a steady rise in steel production worldwide. All major steel-producing countries -- Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, Russia, Turkey, the U.S. and Ukraine -- have recorded healthy production so far this year. According to worldsteel, North American steel output jumped 50.3% year over year to 74.8 million tons in the first 8 months of 2010. However, it is still lagging the 19.4% growth rate seen in 2008. In the European Union, steel production shot up 37.5% to 115.6 million tons in the first 8 months of 2010 while production in Asia climbed 17.8% to 592.7 million tons. Of this, China experienced a 15.3% production growth to 425.7 million tons while Japanese production leapt 38.1% to 72.7 million tons over the first 8 months. Over the same period, steel production in Brazil soared 40.5% to 22.1 million tons and that in Russia jumped 15.4% to 43.8 million tons. In Ukraine, steel production moved up 11.7% to 21.2 million tons. Industry Capacity The global steel industry is capital intensive, cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity. Capacity utilization rates were, however, low (around 60%) at the beginning of 2009, in response to the much softer demand. With steel demand picking up in the latter half of the year, capacity utilization rates increased to above 70%. Utilization rates continued to increase in the first half of 2010, averaging at over 80%. The capacity utilization rate has, however, come down to around 70% again since then. Steel makers continue to add capacity besides resuming operations at the idled facilities, inspired by the expected rebound in steel industry in the longer term. Price Trends The steel industry has long witnessed volatility in prices with a large spot market. Steel prices rose steadily for most of 2008, after which there was a downtrend. Lower prices had an adverse effect on steel producers, who recorded lower revenues and margins, and had to write down finished steel and raw material inventories. The period witnessed major steel producers slashing production to minimize inventory accumulation. U.S. Steel Corporation (X), the fifth-largest steel producer worldwide, cut down production by almost 62% during the second quarter of 2009, while Korean steel maker POSCO (PKX) cut production by about 15%. This was the first time in its history that POSCO was forced to adopt such a measure, proof of the very adverse operating environment. Although steel prices have been stabilizing since the latter part of 2009, it is significantly below the pre-crisis level. We believe that a sustained recovery in steel prices remains uncertain in the backdrop of sluggish economic activity. Factors Affecting Steel Prices Chinese Imports: The steel industry is also affected by fluctuations in steel import–export and tariffs. China is the largest steel producer globally, with the balance between its domestic production and consumption being an important factor in global steel prices. Consumers in the U.S. are importing cheaper steel from China, which is forcing domestic steel producers to sell at lower prices, and even at a loss, sometimes. To this end, the U.S. government has been imposing anti-dumping duties on Chinese steel imports. Concerns about the sustainability of economic recovery and question marks about China's growth momentum come into play in the pricing equation. This relatively uncertain China outlook, coupled with a still tentative recovery in the developed world, is expected to weigh on prices. Threat from substitutes: Steel has many substitutes like aluminum, which replaces it in the automotive markets. Cement, composites, glass, plastic and wood are also used as steel substitutes. This significantly influences market prices and demand for steel products. Raw Material Trends The key input for steel production is iron ore. Apart from this, coking coal and coke, scrap, electricity and natural gas are also used as inputs in steel production. The raw materials industry is highly concentrated with only three major players -- Vale (VALE), Rio Tinto (RTP) and BHP Billiton (BHP) – having significant pricing power. The risk lies in consolidation among raw material suppliers. For instance, the announced iron ore joint venture between mining companies BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto would further increase the pricing power of both the suppliers. Steel makers would face higher production costs if suppliers shift to sales based on spot prices from the long-term fixed price contract system, as spot prices for most of the raw materials, especially iron ore, remained high from 2006 through 2008. In 2009, iron ore prices, which are linked with the London Metal Exchange prices, were about 28% to 33% below the benchmark prices. Iron ore prices have remained volatile during most of 2010 and are expected to rise sharply in 2011. AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) expects a 65% rise in benchmark iron ore prices in the near term. The company assumes reduction of its earnings by $11 million or $7 per ton for each 5% increase in iron ore prices. The prices of coking coal, zinc and nickel, as well as scrap, have followed a similar trend. Consolidation Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) have remained an important business strategy in the steel industry. M&A activities prevent additional steel capacity, providing production efficiency and economies of scale. The biggest example is Mittal Steel's acquisition of Arcelor in 2006 and their merger in 2007. The Tata Steel and Corus merger in 2008 is another good instance of industry consolidation. The industry is likely to see more M&A activity in the coming years as the industry players prepare themselves for a recovery in the long run. Zacks Recommendation Iron ore pricing concerns have led to a negative outlook for steel manufacturers. Revenues and average selling prices are lower, as the U.S. and global markets are in a gradual recovery. In the short term, we are negative on steel manufacturers like AK Steel Holding Corporation, Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) and Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (ATI). AK Steel's cost structure is higher than its peer group due to a greater reliance on an external supply of raw materials such as carbon scrap, purchased slabs, iron ore and purchased coke. Iron ore is the key raw material in steel manufacturing operations. The company expects to purchase about 6 million tons of iron ore pellets in 2010. One of the largest and most diversified producers of specialty materials in the world, Allegheny Technologies has forecasted operating losses in the near-term. Allegheny has been battling cost-pressures associated with high raw material costs. For Allegheny, a hypothetical $1.00 per mmbtu increase in the price of natural gas would result in increased annual energy costs of about $10 to $12 million. Costs of scrap and oil are also rising significantly. A change of $1.00 per pound in nickel prices would result in increased costs of about $80 million, while a hike of $0.01 per pound of ferrous scrap would result in increased costs of approximately $5 million. We remain strongly negative on Steel Dynamics, the third-largest steel maker in the U.S., who is operating its structural steel mills at less than 40% of its total capacity due to uncertain demand conditions. However, industry giants with integrated business models like U.S. Steel Corp and ArcelorMittal have an edge over their peers. Both steel makers have substantial captive sources of iron ore and coal and source about 75%–80% of their coke and iron ore requirements from owned and/or operated facilities. U.S. Steel Corp returned to profitability in the second quarter of 2010 on improving business conditions. Similarly, earnings of Nucor Corporation, the largest recycler of steel scrap in the U.S. , broke out from the loss territory in the last quarter of 2009. We expect Nucor to exhibit strong profitability driven by long-term contracts, cost reduction efforts and a dominant acquisition strategy. Collectively, ArcelorMittal, AK Steel, Allegheny Technologies, United States Steel Corporation and Nucor Corporation carry long-term Neutral recommendations, while Steel Dynamics has a long-term Underperform recommendation.

2010-11-01,Balancing Election Results with Trading Ideas  11-01-2010,"Cusick' Corner The highly anticipated mid-term elections are tomorrow, so how can a trader or investor strategize the potential outcomes? If the election plays out as pundits anticipate, GOP takes the House and the Democrats maintain the Senate, we could see a short-term gridlock bounce and then a consolidation until sideline money can figure potential entry points into the market. That is a macro level perspective, but how might you look at the individual races as they pertain to the market and potential reaction, maybe a little longer term? With the amount of turnover expected, due to retirement or loss by incumbents, there is going to be leadership shifts in key committees. For example, Chris Dodd is retiring, that means there will be a new Finance Committee Chairman. If the Dems' keep control of the Senate, Tim Johnson of South Dakota is anticipated to be the successor to Dodd. Since Johnson's state has heavy exposure to credit card operations, aka JOBS, it is plausible that he and the committee could be more favorable to these companies, i.e. start looking at credit card companies that may have operations in the state of the senator that heads a key committee. This is how we can balance the election results with potential investment/trading ideas. See you Midday and get out and vote. Major averages finished mixed following a relatively volatile trading session Monday. Economic news was in focus early after a report released before the bell showed personal incomes falling .1 percent and spending up .2 percent in September. Economists were looking for gains of .2 percent in incomes and .4 percent in spending. Yet, with help from strength in overseas and commodities markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened higher and moved to its best levels of the day after the Institute of Supply Management [ISM] index of manufacturing activity was released. ISM showed improvement to 56.9 in October, up from 54.4 in September and much better than the 54.0 that economists had expected. A separate report showed construction spending up .5 percent in September and also better than the .7 percent decline that economists had expected. Major averages hit a high on the data, drifted lower into midday and then a round of aggressive selling surfaced in the final hour. At its lows, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 56 points and off 182 points from session highs. However, things had stabilized by the closing bell and the Dow settled the day up 7 points. The NASDAQ lost 2.6. Bullish Flow Steelmaker Nucor (NUE) lost 2 cents to $38.02 on the session and options volume rose to 3X the average daily, with about 29,000 calls and 3,230 puts traded in the name. A good chunk of the volume was due to a ratio spread, in which an investor apparently sold 17,304 November 40 calls at 51 cents and bought half as many (8,652) December 40 calls at $1.02. This looks like an ongoing position adjustment in NUE. On October 1, the October – November 40 call spread traded 25,000X. At that time, it appears the investor was rolling out of October and into November. So, this strategist might be adjusting a bullish position at the first of every month and two or three weeks before the options expiration. They probably want to maintain exposure to the name, but not see the position lose too much value due to time decay. Shorter-term options experience time decay at a faster rate than longer-term options. Bullish options action was also seen in Southwest Energy (SWN), Avanir Pharmaceuticals (AVNR), and Discover Financial Services (DFS). Bearish Flow Big Lots (BIG) has seen two days of bearish trading. Options action picked up in the November 30 and 32.5 puts Friday. A total of 5,590 puts and 235 puts traded on the retailer. Today, shares lost 47 cents to $30.90 and options volume hit 6X the average daily after 4,144 calls and 3,048 puts traded on the session. The top trade was 783 December 30 put – December 35 call bearish risk-reversals at 72 cents on ISE. That is, according to ISEE sentiment data, this investor was buying December 30 puts and selling December 35 calls to open a new bearish position. The risk-reversal traded more than 1,500X on the day. There is no recent news on the ticker. Shares are in the midst of a four-day 8.4 percent skid and the bearish traders Friday and Monday might be taking positions on concerns about the downside momentum building in BIG shares. Bearish flow also picked up in AMAG Pharmaceuticals (AMAG), Exco Resources (XCO), and American Movil (AMX). Index Trading Trading in the index pits is slow, even as significant event risk looms. In addition to the mid-term elections tomorrow and a Fed rating meeting Wednesday, monthly jobs data have market moving potential Friday. Yet there's little hedging activity going on. 453,000 puts and 331,000 calls traded across the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) and other cash indexes Monday, which is 72 percent the normal activity, according to Trade Alert data. However, while volume is light, the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) has been moving. VIX is in the midst of a six-day 16.2 percent run higher. The volatility index finished up .63 to 21.83. Like last week, VIX is moving higher despite little movement in the SPX, which finished up 1.12 to 1,184.38. A rising VIX in a period of very low actual volatility could be warning for investors to brace for increasing volatility in the weeks ahead. ETF Trading While volume in the index market is light, there have been signs of hedging activity in the exchange-traded funds. For example, Powershares QQQ (QQQQ), which holds all of the NASDAQ 100 names, added 4 cents to $52.22 and 318,000 puts (138,000 calls) traded in the Qs. January 48 and 50 puts were the most actives. More than 58,000 traded in each (116K total) and the volume included a lot of spread trading. For example, in morning action, 5000 Jan 50 puts traded at the $1.29 ask and 5000 Jan 48 puts mid-market at 82 cents. The action has the signs of a bearish spread, at a 47-cent debit, and one that offers a max pay-off if shares fall to $48 or less by the January expiration. A portfolio manager looking to hedge risk through yearend might have initiated the trades. The NASDAQ 100 is an index of the top 100 non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ."
2010-11-01,Priced Into the Market  11-01-2010,"Cusick's Corner Over the weekend a customer asked me, “What do you mean that the Fed quantitative easing, earnings/economic data and the elections are already priced into the market?” I told him to take a look at a SPY chart (the ETF that tracks the S&P 500) and see how the market ran from 112 in mid Sept, then consolidated in the last 3 weeks in OCT, all before the good economic data, earnings and the official Fed announcement (due out Nov 3rd). The market has stalled at our current levels for the past 5 sessions which does not mean that we could not get a “pop” post the elections and FOMC, but this could be a classic buy the rumor and sell the news event. This indecisive action, while muted with these upcoming events, highlights the need to be disciplined. Disciplined traders need to use all their tools in their arsenal, most notably protection. Now insurance, in the form of put options, is relatively cheap, VIX 21.60. Buying puts could be a viable approach, especially if the market does decide to challenge support, 117 on the SPY, and move down to the previous resistance points that trigger the Sept/Oct rally, 112 on the SPY. Watching the charts and these key price points can help add some visibility. See you After Hours. Major averages are holding modest gains with help from stronger-than-expected manufacturing data. Stocks opened broadly higher Monday morning on positive manufacturing numbers in China. The domestic news wasn't so bright after a report showed personal incomes falling .1 percent and spending up .2 percent in September. Economists were looking for gains of .2 percent in incomes and .4 percent in spending. Yet, with help from strength in overseas and commodities markets, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened higher and moved to its best levels of the day after the Institute of Supply Management [ISM] index of manufacturing activity was released. ISM showed improvement to 56.9 in October, up from 54.4 in September and much better than the 54.0 that economists had expected. A separate report showed construction spending up .5 percent in September and also better than the .7 percent decline that economists had expected. After an initial run higher, the rally on Wall Street ran out of steam. Trading turned cautious ahead of mid-term elections and a Fed meeting on interest rates later this week. The Dow is up 50 points midday and 76 points from session highs. The NASDAQ is up 3. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) seized another .20 to 21.40. Options volume is respectable. 3.6 million calls and 3.1 million puts traded by 12:00 ET. Bullish Southwest Energy (SWN) shares are up 4.4 percent to $35.35 and appear to be rallying on news rival oil and gas producer Exco Resources (XCO) is being bought for $4.4 billion. XCO is up 35 percent on the merger announcement. Meanwhile, SWN moved higher in early trading and options volume is running 3X the average daily. About 22,000 calls and 6,275 puts traded in the name so far. January 36, 38 and 39 calls are among the most actives. December 30 puts and November 36 calls are seeing active trading as well. Avanir Pharmaceuticals (AVNR) shares surged 121 percent to $5.35 after the FDA approved the company's treatment for a neurological disorder called pseudobulbar affect. Shares notched a new 52-week high on the news and options volume surged. 64,000 calls and 17,000 puts traded on the biotech so far. November $3 and $5 calls are the most actives, with 12,745 and 26,415 traded respectively. Bearish Powershares QQQ (QQQQ) is seeing brisk trading. Shares of the exchange-traded fund, which hold all of the NASDAQ 100 names, notched a new 52-week high and are up 18 cents to $52.36. Meanwhile, 268,000 puts and 79,000 calls traded on the fund. January 48 and 50 puts are the most actives. More than 58,000 traded in each (116K total). The volume includes a lot of spread trading. For example, 5000 Jan 50 puts traded at the $1.29 ask and 5000 Jan 48 puts mid-market at 82 cents. The action has the signs of a bearish spread, at a 47-cent debit, and one that offers a max pay-off if shares fall to $48 or less by the January expiration. Wilmington Trust (WL) is reeling on news it is being taken “under”. Shares are down $3 to $4.13 after announcing a merger with MTB in a transaction valued at $3.84 per share. The stock touched a new 52-week low on the news and options volume is 11X the average daily, with 11,000 puts and 3,400 calls traded in the bank so far.

Increasing volume is also being seen in Southwest Energy (SWN), Boston Scientific (BSX), and St. Joe (JOE). Implied Volatility Movers Rambus (RMBS) rallied to $20.01 in morning trading and 9,800 calls have traded in the chipmaker so far. The volume represents 7X the expected for midday. There's no company-specific news to explain the increased interest. It's focused on the November 20 and 21 calls. Shares are now flat at $19.74, but the increased activity has implied volatility moving up 9 percent to 36."
2010-11-02,"For Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) Investors, it May Pay to be Patient","Iron and steel mining name Nucor (NYSE:NUE) has settled into a trading range of late, bouncing back and forth between the 35 and 40 levels since early July. Judging from some volume in the Nucor options pit Monday, it looks as though a large-scale investor may be targeting a breakout from this range but not until several weeks in the future. An hour after the trading week kicked off, large blocks traded in the NUE November 40 and December 40 calls. It looks as though the investor sold 17,304 of the November-dated calls for 51 cents apiece and bought 8,652 of the December calls for $1.02 each creating a one by two calendar spread. Twice as many short-term calls were sold, making this a costless trade before commissions ($0.51 credit times two = $1.02 debit). The trader is evidently selling the short-term calls to finance the purchase of the longer-dated long call, in the hopes that NUE will begin to advance after the November calls expire. This is a good example of how the time element of options trading can make all the difference between success and failure. For this trade to have a shot at profitability, the shares have to stay put for three weeks and then begin to rally, overtaking the 40 level between November expiration on November 19 and December expiration on December 17. If the November options expire in-the-money, the investor will likely be assigned, creating a short stock position with the maximum loss unlimited and the maximum gain capped if the stock goes to zero. The long December calls would cover half of this assignment and the trader will have a large short delta position to deal with. He would also have to buy enough stock to cover the remaining 865,200 shares (we have no way of knowing if this investor already owns NUE shares). If the November positions expire out-of-the-money, the investor will effectively be long the December calls with a cost basis of zero. At this point, he could simply sell them to close, and any premium collected would be profit on the overall trade. They could also keep them as a long call position if they expect a rally in the stock. The breakeven price for this long call is technically $41.02, although this particular investor's premium was offset by selling the front-month calls. Gains are theoretically unlimited for a long call and losses are limited to the premium paid. NUE reported earnings on October 21 and its most high-profile peers announced last week. There may not be any earnings-related volatility until the next reporting season in late January, long after both the November and December options expire.

2010-11-09,"Steel Stocks Solid (X, SCHN, NUE)","The steel stocks are running today, as they have been since then Federal Reserve announced an additional $600 billion in quantitative easing last week, in an effort to boost economic growth. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) is up 95 cents this morning to $48.65, a gain of 2%. Volume is particualrly strong this morning, as it's already traded more than 7 million shares, just an hour into trading. The average volume is 12 million shares. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) is up 1% this morning to $40.69, a gain of 41 cents. Volume isn't as heavy as it is in U.S. Steel, despite the strength in the sector. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc.

Daily volume for the stock is just over 300,000 shares."
2010-11-15,Investors Sell Long-Term Calls in Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG),"Consumer-products giant The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is up about 7% year-to-date. While nothing to sneeze at, this is below the 8% gain seen in the overall broader market. Both of these measurements are price return only, not including dividends. Since the overall market has about a 2% dividend yield and PG has a 3% dividend yield, the total returns appear to be right in line. For the past six years or so, P & G shares have stayed within a fairly wide range, with narrow movement below 50 or above 70. Judging by some of today's options activity, it appears that investors are assuming this limited volatility will continue through the next 12 to 14 months. Roughly an hour into the trading day, a block of 10,000 PG January 2012 70-strike calls traded for $2.03 per contract. This was the bid price at the time so indicates the options were opened on the sell side of the trade. In exchange for selling these long-term upside calls, the investor collected $2.03 million in premium. This short option was tied to the purchase of stock – 330,000 shares of stock, to be specific. The investor appears to have paid $64.89 per share ($21.4 million in total) to open this delta neutral position. Because the delta risk is lowered, changes in the price of the stock itself will not have a pronounced impact on the trade. For every tick higher in PG shares, gains in the long stock should theoretically be offset by losses in the short call. What will impact this trade is a change in implied volatility. The position is negative vega so declining volatility will positively impact the overall value of the two-legged position. A one-point move in implied volatility will theoretically impact the option price 24.8 cents. The total short vega from this block trade is $248,000 for each vol point. If volatility declines in PG and the stock subsequently tightens its trading range, the chance for profitability increases. The option price indicated about a 15.8% implied volatility, compared to 30-day historical volatility of 9.3%. Today's trader is likely expecting implied vol to possibly decrease, enabling this substantial trade to profit before expiration. If the position does not move in the trader's favor, theoretical losses are significant in either direction and unlimited to the upside. If held until expiration, the delta-hedge ratio will change and it is expected the short call trader will adjust his stock position appropriately.

The DR analysts cited the company's recent Q4 EPS guidance, which was below their estimates; management also indicated that the inability to pass along significantly higher raw material prices quickly enough impacted 4Q10 results. Although the analysts are encouraged by reports of growing order books and price hikes that appear to be sticking, for the time being they are more concerned about high raw material costs and challenging residential and non-residential construction markets, which continue to show weakness according to Nucor management. As for valuation, the analysts remarked, “We are decreasing our 4Q10 EPS estimate to a loss of $0.05 from a $0.04 gain and our full year 2010 estimate to $0.41 from $0.50 based upon higher scrap costs. We are maintaining our 2011 EPS estimate and Hold rating on NUE.”"

2010-12-21,Option Investors (Still) Bearish on Wells Fargo (WFC),"The February options series opened for business in Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) yesterday and one large-scale options investor appears to have swooped in to extend a bearish trade. Wells shares are up 9.5% in the past month and have gained slightly more than that year-to-date, but this investor evidently expect the banking giant to experience some moderate downside during the next couple of months. In mid-session trading on Monday, large blocks traded on the January 27.50 put and the February 25 and 28 puts. Looking at volume, open interest, and pricing trends, it appears as though the January puts were sold to close while a bear put spread was opened in the February series. All of the volume changed hands right around the same time and all of the activity was marked as spread trading. In other words, investors sold to close existing long puts in the January series and opted to roll out this bearish thesis in a more conservative way, buying the February 28 puts and selling the 25 puts. A bear put spread requires less capital outlay than a standard long put but will also cap gains as well as limit losses. The 20,000 lot of this bear put spread traded for a net debit of 48 cents (or $960,000 in total), with the February 25 puts sold for 20 cents each and the February 28 puts purchased for 68 cents each. This premium paid is also the most the spread trader can lose, if WFC is trading at 28 or above when the options expire. Breakeven for this spread is $27.52, or the long put strike less the debit paid. This is roughly 8.5% lower than the stock's current price of $30.10, so the investor is hoping for a fair amount of downside through February expiration in about 60 days. If WFC does decline dramatically, profits are capped at $2.52, which is the difference in strike prices less the debit paid. At expiration, profits peak below the 25 strike. Return on risk for this spread is 525%, or the maximum potential gain of $2.52 divided by the maximum potential loss of $0.48. Today, delta for this out-of-the-money put spread is -16.6. For any dollar decline in WFC shares, the spread will theoretically gain 16.6 cents. Conversely, the spread will lose 16.6 cents for every dollar the stock declines. Assuming no movement in the stock or in underlying volatility, delta will decrease as the time until expiration evaporates. WFC recently edged back above the 30 level after several months below this round-number threshold. Perhaps Monday's option action shows an expectation for the stock to face resistance from this strike over the near term.

2010-12-28,CBOE Put/Call Ratio Below .75  12-28-2010,"Cusick's Corner After the market's tight range yesterday and now again today, market watchers are taking notice of volatility's move to the upside -- specifically the VIX popping from 16 to 18. This is a little unusual considering the light volume, tight range and the offensive sectors, i.e. XLF, continue to catch a bid and show leadership to the upside. What has shaken the short-term support for the bulls is a well known sentiment indicator Put/Call Ratio, specifically the CBOE P/C Ratio is below .75. We have not seen this Ratio at that level since the beginning of November and it has been a signal for a potential turn in the short-term market segment. I am taking a contrarian perspective when looking at the P/C Ratio this way. While the market has all the momentum still clearly pointing to the upside, I keep an eye on this gauge for some potential signs of a market turn. See you After Hours. Stocks are trading mixed in uneventful market action through midday. Economic data was in focus early after the Conference Board reported that its index of Consumer Confidence fell to 52.5 in December, from 54.3 the month before. Economists were looking for an increase to 56.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was already trading lower ahead of the data, showed little reaction to the report. Action in the commodities market is getting some attention, as gold has rallied to new highs and crude oil is trading higher as well. But with not much other news to guide the action, there isn't much volatility and the Dow has traded in another narrow 39-point range. The industrial average is up 3 points at midday, but the tech-heavy NASDAQ is down 8.7. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) edged up .30 to 17.97. Options volume remains light, but a bit better than yesterday. 2.4 million calls and 1.6 million puts traded through 11:00 ET. Bullish Pfizer (PFE) shares are up 17 cents to $17.66 and PFE April 19 calls are today's most actively traded equity options contract through midday. 112,340 contracts have changed hands. Morning trades include two blocks of 40,570 contracts (X2) April 19 calls at 25 and 26 cents each. The bid and ask at the time was 24 and 26 cents. Open interest is only 572 contracts and so this is looking like an opening buyer, perhaps buying calls as a way to lock-in their right to buy the stock at $19 through mid-April 2011. Molycorp (MCP) is rallying for a second day. Shares jumped more than 9 percent yesterday. Today, MCP notched another 52-week high and is trading up $2.72 to $52.16 on news China has increased export quotas on rare earth materials. Meanwhile, in options action, 16,000 calls and 18,000 puts have traded in MCP. January 50, 55, 60 and 65 calls are seeing brisk trading. However, the January 50 put is the day's most active. While some investors appear to be buying short-term calls to play the stock's upward momentum, others are probably buying puts to hedge or protect recent gains. MCP is now up more than 80 percent so far in December. Bearish Career Education (CECO) is seeing a second day of bearish trading. As noted in yesterday's closing wrap, February 17 puts were busy Monday. Today, some investors might be adding to those positions. Another 2,575 traded and, like yesterday, the volume is trading predominantly at the ask (94 percent). With shares off 33 cents to $19.95, the flow over the past two days seems to reflect some concern about the short-term outlook for the for-profit education company. Earnings are expected around February 17 and possibly before the expiration. iShares MSCI Mexico Fund (EWW) loses a nickel to $61.22 and January puts are seeing some interest Tuesday morning. Jan 61s are the most actives. 14,940 traded. 73 percent traded at the ask, according to data from whatstrading.com website, and open interest is 623. So, it looks like buyers are opening new positions. Jan 60 puts are seeing interest as well. The overall action appears to be defensive or bearish trading on concerns about the short-term outlook for Mexico's equity markets. Unusual Volume Movers Pfizer (PFE) options volume is running 2.5X the usual, with 152,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 92 percent of the activity, according to data from website WhatsTrading.com. MannKind (MNKD) options activity is running 5X the usual, with 134,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 63 percent of the volume. Kraft (KFT) options volume is 15X the typical levels, with 130,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 99 percent of the activity. Increasing volume is also being seen in Rare Earth (REE), Deere (DE), and Nucor (NUE). Implied Volatility Movers Rare Earth (REE) is rallying along with peer Molycorp (see Bullish) and implied volatility is up for a second day. Shares have added $1.58 to $13.31 and options volume is 6X the average daily. 37,000 calls and 12,000 puts traded so far. Jan 10, 12.5, 14 and 15 calls are seeing brisk trading. Meanwhile, implied volatility is up 21 percent to 100 and has gained nearly 40 percent on the week."
2011-01-11,5 Stocks To Watch On The Back Of Alcoa's Strong Report (AA),"Sure shares of Alcoa (NYSE: AA) are down around 2% today on the back of earnings, but the earnings report and the commentary is much more important the 2% move that stock is making today. Alcoa beat Wall Street estimates yesterday after the bell, as the unofficial start to earnings season got underway. Alcoa reported 21 cents on revenues of $5.7 billion, which was 3 cents better than Wall Street expectations. Revenue came in line with estimates. More importantly, it looks like Klaus and crew have turned the ship around, as the company continues to surprise with its EPS. It's even more noteworthy, as aluminum is the most energy intensive metal to make. With rising energy costs, one could assume that Alcoa might have problems beating estimates. Not the case apparently. Pricing for alumina and aluminum continued to show strength in the quarter, as evidenced by strong demand from abroad. If you are looking to trade off the back of the strong report from Alcoa, Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), Chinalco (NYSE: ACH), are two aluminum plays, with Rio Tinto owning Alcan. Alcoa said it potentially weak results in automobile sales in China, on the back of higher taxes on cars. Sales are expected to rise 10-15% this year, as opposed to last year's 32%. I expect auto sales in the U.S., which is the second largest car market after China will continue to improve, as the economic conditions here improve. Steel companies like U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) should benefit from improved U.S. auto sales. Alcoa didn't have a homerun quarter, but this was certainly worth at least a double, and maybe an RBI. Alcoa, led by Klaus Kleinfeld, looks like it's turning the corner, and I have to say well done.

2011-01-11,Calls Purchased on Nucor Corporation (NUE),"Shares of Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) are higher on the session by 1.92%, currently trading at $44.59. The stock has been moving largely higher over the past two months and is currently trading above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Options traders are buying calls on the name today. A short while ago the July 2011 $42.00 call was purchased 10,000 times, on the offer, on open interest of 10,048 contracts. Overall call volume is now running at 2.26x the daily average with 82% of all calls traded being purchases on the offer. Nucor Corporation along with its affiliates is engaged in the business of manufacturing of steel and steel products, with operating facilities and customers primarily located in North America. The company operates in three business segments: steel mills, steel products and raw materials."
2011-01-18,AK Steel Wins Lawsuit - Analyst Blog,"AK Steel Holding Corp. (AKS) won a lawsuit brought against the company by two French units of the steel giant, ArcelorMittal (MT). The suit alleged that AK Steel and two other steel producers infringed upon a U.S. patent for aluminum-coated, boron-bearing carbon steels, used primarily for high-strength automotive applications. However, the jury found no infringement of the ArcelorMittal patent. The decision now allows AK Steel to begin offering the product for sale immediately to the U.S. customers. Though the company had the capability to produce steel, prospective customers were not buying because of fear of a legal conflict. AK Steel employs about 6,200 people and produces flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steel products, as well as carbon and stainless tubular steel products. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, AK Steel posted net loss of $59.2 million or 54 cents per share versus a net income of $6.2 million or 6 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Reported losses were higher than the Zacks Consensus loss of 34 cents per share. AK Steel has a more diverse product portfolio compared to its peers. The company is focusing on markets and products that have greater potential in the long term. However, average selling prices are lower, as the U.S. and global markets are on a gradual recovery. The ongoing slowdown has marred prospects in the housing and construction sectors. We expect AK Steel to report a weak fourth quarter with rising iron ore costs and moderating steel prices. AK Steel faces stiff competition from Nucor Corporation (NUE), Steel Dynamics Inc. (STLD) and ArcelorMittal. Currently, AK Steel has a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) for the short term and an Underperform recommendation for the long term.

2011-01-19,Investors Steel Selves for Steel's 2011 ,"(TheStreet) -- Steelmakers have lifted prices for certain products to levels not seen since the boom era, inducing a bullish spirit in some industry watchers, who say share prices among steel names have yet to catch up. A run-up in raw materials prices has helped steel mills press home higher prices with their biggest customers, especially auto makers and distribution centers. The going price for a ton of hot-rolled coil -- the core product of the traditional Big Steel blast furnace -- has spiked from about $500 in early December to more than $800 as of mid January. The last time it saw such heights came in April 2008. Certainly, steel stocks rallied in December. But bullish observers point out that the last time steel prices were at these levels, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) shares were trading north of $150, Nucor (NYSE: NUE) traded at more than $70 and AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) was above $65. The stocks now stand at $55, $45 and $15, respectively. The reasons behind the raw materials price inflation have been well documented. Epochal floods have inundated the coal mines of Queensland, Australia, which supplies nearly 70% of the planet's coking coal, used to smelt iron ore in blast furnaces, and therefore a crucial steel ingredient. China's steel industry -- the biggest on earth -- continues to absorb so much coal and iron ore that the likes of Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) and Vale (NYSE: VALE) posted record production during the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, the price of scrap metal has roared higher, allowing the electric-arc furnace companies such as Nucor and Steel Dynamics to increase prices as well. Continue reading the article."

2011-01-25,"X Marks The Dead Spot! (X, MT, AKS, NUE, SCHN)","Will U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) ever get its act together? The company just reported a fourth quarter GAAP loss of $1.74 per share, well below what Wall Street had expected. Analysts had expected a loss of $1.12 per share, so this was quite a miss. Revenue did fare better than expected, coming in at $4.3 billion versus the $4.22 billion Wall Street estimates had anticipated. This huge miss comes just one day after Citi raised its price target on the stock and predicted fourth quarter results. Commenting on results, U. S. Steel Chairman and CEO John P. Surma said, We reported a modest improvement in our fourth quarter operating results in comparison to the third quarter mainly due to reduced spending for facility repair and maintenance, including structural repairs and inspections, and a net gain related to asset sales. The improvements were partially offset by decreases in realized prices and a reduction in total shipments, reflecting soft steel market conditions during most of the quarter and the traditional seasonal downtime taken by some of our customers during the latter part of the quarter. Commenting on U. S. Steel's outlook for the first quarter, Surma said, We expect to report a modest improvement in reportable segment results in comparison to the fourth quarter 2010. Order rates for most customer groups and publicly reported spot market prices began to increase later in the fourth quarter and we remain cautiously optimistic that global economic conditions will continue to improve in the first quarter. These results will heavily weigh on shares of the other steel makers today, like Arcelor Mittal (NYSE: MT), AK Steel (NYSE: AKS), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), and Schnitzer Steel (NASDAQ: SCHN).

2011-01-25,AK Steel Underperforms - Analyst Blog,"AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) reported fourth quarter results incurring an adjusted after-tax loss of $54.5 million or 49 cents per share outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of loss of 62 cents per share. Fourth quarter results excluded one-time items of $63.7 million pre-tax charge related to the earlier announced AK Steel Holding Corporation and $9.1 million pre-tax charge pertaining to a retiree benefit settlement associated with the company's Butler (PA) Works. Including these special items, the company reported a loss of $98.3 million or 89 cents per share compared with a net income of $39.8 million or 36 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. For fiscal FY10, the company reported after-tax loss of $59.8 million or 54 cents per share outperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 68 cents per share. Fiscal FY10 excluded $72.8 million of charges mentioned above and a non-cash charge of $25.3 million, related to federal healthcare legislation. Including these charges full year EPS amounted to a net loss of $128.9 million or $1.17 per share compared with a net loss of $74.6 million or 68 cents in the prior year. Total revenue as reported by the company increased 5.5% year over year to $1,390.6 million in the reported quarter. However, shipments decreased marginally by 0.6% year over year to 1,359,900 tons. The revenue as reported by the company was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The increase in total revenue was attributable to higher selling price. For fiscal FY10, the company reported net sales of $5968.3 million, an increase of 46.4% year over year. Total revenue as reported by the company was slightly above the Zacks Consensus estimate of $5966 million. Cost and Margins The cost of goods sold increased 21.48% year over year to $1,373.80 million in the quarter and selling and administrative expenses increased 1.2% year over year to $52 million in the quarter. The company also reported an operating loss of $154.6 million, a decrease of 44% from the year-ago quarter, leading to an operating margin decrease of 453 basis points year over year to a negative 11.12%. In fiscal FY10 cost of goods sold increased approximately 50% year over year to $5621.50 million and selling and administrative expenses increased 9.4% to $210.8 million from the prior year. Operating loss of the company increased by 91% year over year to $133.9 million. Consequently, operating margin decreased by 52 basis points year over year to a negative 2.24% Financial Position The company ended the year with a cash and cash equivalent of $216.8 million compared with $461.7 million as of December 31, 2009. Cash from operating activities was an outflow of $132.4 million for fiscal 2010 compared with an inflow of $58.8 million for fiscal 2009. The debt-to-capital ratio of A K Steel stood at 50.2% as of December 31, 2010, 38.4% as of September 30, 2010 and 36.6% as of June 30, 2010. Outlook A K Steel expects an increase of 7% quarter over quarter in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 leading to 1,450,000 tons and approximately 8% quarter over quarter increase in its average per-ton selling price compared with the fourth quarter price level. The expected increase is attributable to the anticipated higher contract and spot market prices and better product mix. For iron ore, scrap and coal, the company expects higher price of raw material, likely to be offset by an improved operating performance. At the operating level, the company expects to break even for the first quarter of fiscal 2011.

2011-01-27,Nucor Posts 4Q Loss  - Analyst Blog,"Nucor Corporation (NUE) recorded a net loss of $23.5 million or 4 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2010, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 10 cents per share compared with the year-ago $58.9 million or 18 cents per share. For the full year 2010, Nucor reported earnings of $134.1 million, or 42 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $293.6 million or 94 cents per share for the year ago period and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 37 cents per share. Nucor also incurred a charge of $10.0 million or 2 cents per share in the reported quarter for termination of its joint venture with HIsmelt and the closure of the plants at Kwinana and Western Australia. Nucor recorded a charge to inventories using the last-in, first-out method of $23 million or 4 cents per share, compared with a credit of $116.9 million or 21 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2009. Revenues Quarterly sales shot up 31% to $3.85 billion compared with $2.94 billion in the year ago period and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93 billion. Revenues were driven by a 14% spike in average realized prices and a 15% rise in total shipments. Steel shipments were up 12% while downstream steel products sales volumes increased 14% year over year. For the year 2010, revenues spiked 42% year over year to $15.84 billion missing the Zacks Consensus estimate of $15.89 billion. Costs During the quarter, cost of sales accelerated by 37% to $3.7 billion. Average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton hiked 30% to $359. Total energy costs decreased about $1 per ton from the fourth quarter of 2009. Pre-operating and start-up costs of new facilities were $39 million compared with $48.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Liquidity Nucor's liquidity position remained strong at the end of the quarter. The company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $2.48 billion as of December 31, 2010 versus $2.24 billion as of December 31, 2009. It has an unused $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. Outlook Nucor is negatively affected by a slowdown across all its product lines due to uncertainty in the overall economy. The most challenging markets for its products are associated with residential and non-residential construction. However, the company expects the price increases for all steel mill products to have a positive impact on earnings in the first quarter of 2011. The company also anticipates that it will continue to experience volatile raw material costs during the first quarter of 2011. Nucor assumes that improvement in operating rates in the next quarter will be the result of combination of both improving demand and steel buyers reacting to increasing raw material and steel prices. Our Take Nucor Corporation, the nation's largest recycler of steel scrap, is facing higher costs in scrap prices and continued weakness in the non-residential market. Moreover, a slowdown in demand from the housing and construction sector and increased production in China are matters of concern. However, long-term contracts, cost reduction efforts and a dominant acquisition strategy could benefit the company in the coming quarters. In addition, Nucor's strong balance sheet positions it well for the long term, but the near-term headwinds in the end-markets are likely to make it difficult for the stock to outperform. Currently, Nucor has a short-term (1 to 3 months) Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) and a long- term Neutral recommendation. Nucor competes with the likes of United States Steel Corporation (and Sumitomo Metal Industries (SMMLY).

In the report, Goldman writes Similar to the other steel producers that have reported this week, we believe that the bulk of price realization for Nucor will be delayed into 2Q from 1Q2011 and that 2H2011 will be a bit stronger than previously anticipated due to our higher steel price assumptions.

We are also raising our 2012 estimate to $3.75 from $3.50 on higher steel price assumptions, and introducing our 2013 EPS estimate of $4.25.

2011-02-16,Chinese Boron-Added Plate Held Subject to Antidumping Order,"The Department of Commerce has issued an affirmative preliminary circumvention ruling determining that Chinese imports of cut-to-length carbon steel (CTL) plate that include economically and metallurgically insignificant amounts of boron are subject to the antidumping duty order on CTL plate. Last year, Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and other domestic plate producers presented the Department of Commerce with compelling evidence that Chinese CTL plate with small amounts of boron added is being produced, marketed and sold to U.S. customers as a means to avoid paying antidumping duties. After completing its preliminary investigation, the Department of Commerce found that the boron-added CTL plate has virtually the same physical characteristics, uses and production process as CTL plate without boron. Therefore, Chinese CTL plate imports including minor amounts of boron will now be held subject to the antidumping duty order. Notably, the Department of Commerce's decision applies to all boron-added Chinese CTL plate imports – regardless of producer, exporter or importer. As a result of the ruling, The Department of Commerce has ordered Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to suspend liquidation of any Chinese boron-added plate imported since April 2010, when the investigation began. CBP will also require cash deposits of estimated duties on all Chinese boron-added plate. The current China-wide antidumping duty rate on plate is 128.59%. Commerce has also asked all interested parties to submit briefs on the subject within 20 days, before proceeding to a final determination. U.S. law authorizes The Department of Commerce to include products altered in minor respects within the scope of an antidumping duty order to prevent circumvention of that order. With respect to the antidumping duty order on Chinese CTL plate, the addition of only 0.0008% boron to the CTL plate converts carbon steel into an alloy steel under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, and so Chinese producers and importers have used this provision to trade and evade the antidumping order for many years. However, as the Commerce Department has now confirmed, the boron-added CTL plate, without special processing and heat treatment, has the same physical characteristics and uses as the subject CTL plate."

2011-03-26,Stocks Going Ex Dividend the Fifth Week of March,"Here is our latest update on the stock trading technique called 'Buying Dividends'. This is the process of buying stocks before the ex dividend date and selling the stock shortly after the ex date at about the same price, yet still being entitled to the dividend. This technique generally works only in bull markets. In flat or choppy markets, you have to be extremely careful. In order to be entitled to the dividend, you have to buy the stock before the ex-dividend date, and you can't sell the stock until after the ex date. The actual dividend may not be paid for another few weeks. WallStreetNewsNetwork.com has compiled a downloadable and sortable list of the stocks going ex dividend during the next week or two. The list contains many dividend paying companies, all with market caps over $500 million, and yields over 2%. Here are a few examples showing the stock symbol, the market capitalization, the ex-dividend date and the yield.Nicor Inc.

US Steel (NYSE: X), Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE), Arcelor Mittal (NYSE: MT), and AK Steel Holding (NYSE: AKS) are all taking a hit in the first moments of trading. US Steel is the weakest of the group trading down 2.5% at $54.84. Nucor is showing some strength only down 0.5% at $46.46. Arcelor Mittal is 0.75% to the downside currently at $36.45.

2011-03-31,"Divergences Galore; Market Remains Indecisive (USO, UNG, APA, DVN, RRC, GAS, X, MT, AKS, NUE, FCX, NEM)","Thus far, this trading week has been full of reversals and divergences mainly emanating out of the materials and commodities sectors. Traders and investors seem to be unsure as to where the market should be and in what direction it should head. For example, after disappointing inventory data, natural gas futures plunged over 3% in the face of crude oil futures being up 2.5% and nearing 52-week highs. Major oil ETF, United States Oil fund (NYSE: USO) consequently closed near intraday highs at $42.60. As of late, rising oil prices have led to higher natural gas prices as investors look to alternative energy as a possible growth sector. Natural gas futures along with natural gas ETF, United States Natural Gas fund (NYSE: UNG), have come twenty percent off of their lows during crude oil's rapid spike from the mid ‘80s. Despite natural gas' morning freefall, shares of underlying natural gas companies diverged, showing no of signs of abating as their equity prices held firm. Shares of Apache Corp (NYSE: APA), Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN), Range Resources Corp (NYSE: RRC), and Nicor (NYSE: GAS) all showed signs of strength and mainly stayed in positive territory throughout the decline. That deviation may have been a sign of things to come as natural gas futures soared off of their lows and went from being down over 3% to being up over 1% – a four percent swing in two hours. The jump led to a subsequent, steady rise in underlying natural gas equity prices. UNG closed the day up 0.25% at $11.50; thirteen cents off of its intraday high. Apache closed positive 0.38% at $130.92. Range Resources was by far the strongest of the group putting in a 1.51% gain at $58.46. Nicor closed near the top of its daily range at $53.70. Devon Energy came into selling pressure at the end of the session; closing up marginally at $91.77. Another divergence came in the form of steel stocks taking a big hit in the early going while mining companies continued their climb following yesterday's strong intraday rebound. Right from the start of trading, shares of steel companies tumbled. US Steel (NYSE: X), Arcelor Mittal (NYSE: MT), AK Steel Corp (NYSE: AKS), and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) all put in big losses, showing little buying interest throughout the day. US Steel was the weakest of the group and closed down 4.21% at $53.94. The equity broke well below its 20- and 50-day moving averages after trading above them in the previous two sessions. AK Steel finished down 3.07% at $15.78. Arcelor took a 1.61% haircut, closing at $36.15. Nucor closed down 1.31% to $46.02, resting directly on top of its 20-day moving average. The mining companies fared much better as Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) put in gains of 0.56%, closing in the middle of the day's trading range at $55.55. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) was also strong, closing up 0.85% at $54.58. Shares of the company came under some selling pressure in the last thirty minutes of trading as copper futures moved from positive to negative territory. What do all these divergences and reversals mean? It means that traders, money managers, and investors have no idea where the market is going and are willing to let it churn until more concrete information becomes available. Perhaps tomorrow's jobs numbers will provide that catalyst for a decisive market move. Until then, it is a trader's playground."
2011-04-05,"Mad Money Lightning Round: Cramer Likes Clear Channel Outdoor, Nucor (CCO, C, NUE, NOG, CLR, EOG, WLL)","On CNBC's Mad Money, Jim Cramer said during the Lightning Round that Clear Channel Outdoor (NYSE: CCO) is “not Clear Channel the radio company; that's private. This is Clear Channel, the outdoor advertising play. People still watch billboards though. I like it. For Citigroup (NYSE: C), he said, We're going to get the reverse split but it's not going to change the fundamentals. The government regulations are making our banks not that competitive and that means these banks are going to lag. Cramer advises investors to own Nucor (NYSE: NUE). He added, “I'd be buying aggressively if it pulls back to $45. The rebuilding in Japan will include Nucor. For Northern Oil and Gas (AMEX: NOG), Jim said, I think their account is good and I like their holdings. Is it as good as Continental Resources (NYSE: CLR)? No. As good as EOG Resources (NYSE: EOG)? No. Good as Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: WLL)? No. But it's still a good situation. Read more on Jim's Views On Benzinga"
2011-04-19,"3 Commodities ETFs You Used To Like, But Can't Like Now, But Might Be Able To Like Again Later","Things are not well these days across myriad corners of the market. Excluding gold and silver, the same can be said of many commodities and their corresponding ETFs and ETNs. That's led to troublesome declines in ETFs and ETNs that were previously darlings and not just commodities darlings, but in at least one case, a now former broader market superstar. In another case, we have a stealth loser, one whose declines have kind of flown under the radar. In all cases, we have three exchange traded products that you used to love, cannot love right in this moment, but just might be able to warm to again in the medium-term. Let's have a look at this heart-wrenching trio. 1) ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL): PALL topped out just below $85 in February and fell well short of that level at its March peak. Its April high is below both the the February and March highs. In other words, we have a series of lower highs. If PALL breaks $71, a decline to $65 could be in the offing. The Problem: China's car market is slowing. The Solution: Maybe, just maybe, the U.S. economy can rebound enough to spur new car sales and prop up palladium demand and prices. 2) iPath DJ-UBS Cotton TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: BAL): BAL more than tripled from August 2010 through March, perhaps leaving it more vulnerable to a big decline than any other commodities-related ETF or ETN. The Problem(s): Goldman Sachs said take profits in cotton last week. Farmers are planting more cotton to take advantage of higher prices. The Solution(s): Bad weather in cotton-producing regions and some hot hedge fund money into the futures market ought to right this ship, but those are two big X factors. 3) Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB): We wanted to include one equity-based ETF on the list and XLB, our stealth decliner, fits the bill. XLB has been suffering as investors have started to cash in higher-beta fare for more conservative stocks and ETFs. The Problem(s): China's inflation-fighting efforts and weak earnings reports. The Solution: Well, DuPont (NYSE: DD), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) all report earnings this week, but by the looks of things thus far in earnings season, stocks aren't getting much help. XLB's return to bullish ways may be a bit further off than some would like to admit."

2011-04-21,United States Steel Sitting On Support (X),"Shares of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) are sitting on support here, down 75 cents to $52.00, a loss of 1.4%. Nucor (NYSE: NUE) reported earnings this morning, that were better than the Street expected, but the stock is still selling off. U.S. Steel is expected to report earnings on April 26, when Wall Street expects it will report a loss of 37 cents per share on revenues of $4.86 billion. If U.S. Steel is able to report better than expected earnings on Tuesday, this could give shares the catalyst they need to bolt higher, and vice versa, should U.S. Steel report worse than expected numbers. United States Steel Corporation, through its subsidiaries, engages in the production and sale of steel products primarily in North America and Europe."
2011-04-21,Stocks Get Lift from Strong Earnings,"(TheStreet) -- Stocks extended gains Thursday as strong earnings from Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and several Dow components helped offset a lower-than-expected decline in initial jobless claims and a slowdown in manufacturing activity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 24 points, or 0.2%, at 12,478. The S&P 500 was higher by 6 points, or 0.4%, at 1336, and the Nasdaq was ahead by 15 points, or 0.5%, at 2817. The selling looks like routine profit taking rather than a rush for the exits, said James Rev Shark DePorre, founder and CEO of Shark Asset Management, and a contributor to TheStreet. With the long weekend beckoning, a number of market players are likely to take gains and close shop early. Continue reading the article."
2011-04-26,"Dahlman Rose Discusses Miners Earnings (FCX, NUE, STLD, SCCO, BHP)","Dahlman Rose & Co. is out with a research report on miners' earnings, and discusses Freeport McMoran (NYSE: FCX), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), Southern Copper (NYSE: SCCO) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) in the report. In a note to clients, Dahlman writes, Freeport McMoRan, Nucor, Steel Dynamics and Southern Copper released quarterly earnings results and BHP Billiton released its quarterly production report Nucor and Steel Dynamics handily beat our and the consensus earnings estimates as both companies benefited from high steel prices and improving demand and were able to partially offset higher raw material costs through their metals recycling businesses. Increased copper, gold and molybdenum production due to higher than anticipated ore grades at Grasberg and stronger demand in the molybdenum sector led to a substantial quarterly earnings beat for Freeport McMoRan. Southern Copper's earnings fell below our and the consensus estimates due to declining ore grades across a majority of the company's mines and a large increase in operating costs. In its production report, BHP Billiton showed strong iron ore production despite adverse weather conditions and planned maintenance work, but indicated that flooding in Queensland will affect met coal production for the remainder of the 2011 calendar year and that Gulf of Mexico permitting delays will lead to lower petroleum product production (ex-Fayetteville shale acquisition) in 2012."
2011-05-11,Bull & Bear: Nucor Corporation (NUE),"Shares of Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) are trading lower on the session by 1.67%, at $44.21. With shares nearing the 200-day moving average, you have to wonder where they can head next… Bulls: Bulls will note that Nucor Corporation is now sitting on a major support level; this is where the 200-day moving average (which is also upward-sloping) meets the $44.00 historical support-resistance level. This has been a major springboard level in the past, recently sending shares as high as $49.25. Bulls will also note that shares are technically still oversold, which should provide support to shares as well. A bullish trader could buy the July $44/44 risk reversal for a net credit of $0.02—buy call, sell put. Bears: Bears will note that the recent run-up in Nucor Corporation has exhibited the same selling pattern that has occurred for the past two years, which means there is a likelihood that shares continue lower, toward $40.00 before finding support. Bears will also note that the 20-day and 50-day moving averages are both downward-sloping, which could be an indication that this downtrend is just beginning. Bears will also note that put volume has outpaced call volume over the past few weeks and that the strong call volume seen on May 6th was largely selling. A bearish trader could buy the July $45/44 collar for a net debit of $0.58—buy put, sell call. Nucor Corporation and its affiliates manufacture steel and steel products. Nucor also produces direct reduced iron for use in the company's steel mills. It operates in three segments: steel mills, steel products and raw materials. In the steel mills segment, it produces sheet steel (hot and cold-rolled), plate steel, structural steel and bar steel. In the steel products segment, it produces steel joists and joist girders, steel deck, fabricated concrete reinforcing steel, cold finished steel, steel fasteners, metal building systems, steel grating and expanded metal, and wire and wire mesh."
2011-05-11,Geithner's Incompetence Foreshadows Weakness in American Manufacturing,"The unbalanced trade relationship between China and the U.S. has recently come to the forefront of political discourse. In a two day meeting earlier this week, officials from the two economic superpowers met to discuss potential changes to the trade arrangement. The results of the meeting were mixed. The Chinese promised to work toward better protection of U.S. companies' intellectual property and allow U.S.-owned banks to sell mutual funds in the Chinese market. For its part, the U.S. agreed to increased Chinese investment in the American economy. However, the U.S. delegation (led by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner) was unable to get the Chinese to agree to strengthen the yuan against the dollar. Allegations of an undervalued yuan have led many economic commentators in the U.S. to declare that the Chinese are effectively “stealing” American manufacturing jobs. In January, American steel corporation Nucor (NYSE: NUE) accused the Chinese steel industry of engaging in predatory competition. With the U.S. government unable to get the Chinese to revalue their currency and commodity prices rallying back this week, it might signal a continued decline of the dollar. Traders looking to play a weakened dollar might consider an ETF such as the PowerShares Bearish USD Index (NYSE: UDN). A weaker dollar may signal higher interest rates for U.S. debt in the future, and a potential ETF play could be ProShares UltraShort20+ Year Treasury (NYSE: TBT). If the yuan remains undervalued, Chinese exports could continue to benefit. Traders looking to play the broader Chinese economy might consider the iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index (NYSE: FXI). The American trade agreement with China could continue to be a hot topic as the country's trade deficit grows. Though oil imports could be the primary culprit, with unemployment remaining high, helping American manufacturing could be seen as a major political topic in the upcoming election."

2011-06-06,It's Inverted Hammertime!  06-06-2011,"Cusick's Corner With Finance and Energy challenged, plus AAPL under some pressure, the shorts have the strength on their side in spite of Friday's Bullish technical set up that created an inverted hammer. The market looks poised for continued safe haven buying, Gold/Silver, along with continued confusion and choppy action going into the After Hours. I want to see if the April lows will hold and get a bounce into the close. If not, we could see March Lows tested. See you After Hours. Market action is sluggish Monday morning. With no economic data or earnings of importance to guide the early action, cautious trading continued after five consecutive weeks of losses on Wall Street. The AMEX Airline Index (.XAL) is down 1.8 percent amid relative weakness in the sector after an industry trade group cut its profit forecast on the group. High fuel costs, unrest in the Middle East, and the Japan quake are among the reasons for the revised outlook. Meanwhile, within the Dow Jones Industrial Average, two of the financials - BofA (BAC) and JP Morgan (JPM) - are the biggest losers. However, the decline has been orderly thus far and the Dow is down just 7 points. The tech-heavy NASDAQ gave up 5.5 points. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) drifted down .29 to 17.66. Trading in the options market is relatively slow and defensive, with 3.6 million calls and 3.8 million puts traded through 12:15pm ET. Bullish Flow MGM shares are up and options on the casino-operator are actively traded ahead of a conference presentation. Shares added 7 cents to $14.26 and options volume includes 19,000 calls/13,000 puts. June 14 calls, which are now 26 cents in-the-money and expire in 11 days, are the most actives. 6,180 changed hands so far and. Since 68 percent of the options volume traded at the ask, it looks like buyers are dominating the action. June 15 and 16 calls are seeing heavy trading as well. June 12s and 13s are the most active puts. Implied volatility is up 5.5 percent to 45.5, as some investors appear to be anticipating some new company-specific information when MGM presents today at a Goldman Sachs Lodging, Gaming, Restaurant and Leisure conference. Ford Motor (F) loses a penny to $14 and has been driven 6.2 percent lower since monthly auto and truck sales were reported last Wednesday. Options on the automaker are actively traded as well. 144,000 calls and 82,000 puts so far. One investor sold a block of 35,000 January 12.5 calls on the automaker. They also bought 35,000 August 15 calls, 17,500 January 16 calls and a few other smaller blocks of out-of-the-money call options on the automaker. In doing so, they might have exited a position in the January 12.5s, which are 1.50 in-the-money, to open new bullish positions in OTM call options. Bearish Flow Today's most actively traded contract so far is the June 77 put option on the iShares Small Cap ETF (IWM). Shares of the small cap fund are down 52 cents to $80.36 and volume in the Jun 77 put is 57,600 contracts. Much of the volume is due to one spread trade, in which the investor sold 20,000 June 82 puts and bought 40,000 June 77 puts. This 1X2 put ratio backspread was initiated at a credit and might be their forecast that shares will either 1) move back above $82 through the June expiration (in 11 days) and all the puts expire worthless or 2) shares make a substantial move lower between now and the expiration, and the spread makes money because there's more long (77 puts) compared to short (82 puts). On the other hand, it might a closing trade or maybe a roll, as there is substantial open interest in both contracts. Gen-probe (GPRO) shares are down and calls on the research company are being sold after the Wall Street Journal reported that Novartis (NVS) is the sole remaining bidder for GPRO. There has been talk previously that multiple bidders would be interested in Gen-probe. The stock is down $10.12 to $71.64 and August 85 calls are the most actives. 6,550 traded and, with 93 percent on the bid and open interest of 8,751, it appears that call sellers are closing out positions. The contract is now 18.6 percent out-of-the-money and has the most open interest of any GPRO contract. Unusual Volume Lorillard (LO) options volume is running 4.5X the (22-day) average, with 26,000 contracts traded and put volume accounting for about 73 percent of trades. Focus Media (FMCN) options volume is 2X the average daily, with 20,000 contracts traded and put volume representing for 84 percent of the activity. Starbuck's (SBUX) options volume is running 2X the average daily, with 18,000 contracts traded and put volume accounting for 59 percent of the activity. Increasing options activity is also being seen in United Therapeutics (UTHR), Nucor (NUE), and Harley Davidson (HOG). Implied Volatility Mover Lorillard (LO) shares are down and implied volatility is up on news a court has ruled to allow a tobacco racketeering lawsuit to proceed. Shares opened lower following multiple broker downgrades and are off $7.05 to $100.68 at midday. Options volume includes 19,000 puts and 7,260 calls. July 110 and 90 puts are the most actives. Implied volatility jumped 33 percent to 55."

2011-06-15,Nucor Lowers Guidance For Its Second Quarter Earnings; $0.75-$0.80 vs. $0.87 Estimate,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today guidance for its second quarter ending July 2, 2011. Nucor expects second quarter results to be in the range of $0.75 to $0.80 per diluted share. This represents an increase of 160% - 180% over second quarter 2010 earnings of $0.29 per diluted share, and an increase of 50% - 60% over first quarter 2011 earnings of $0.50 per diluted share. Projected second quarter results include an estimated LIFO charge of $31 million ($0.06 per diluted share) compared to charges of $67 million in the second quarter of 2010 ($0.13 per diluted share) and $31 million in the first quarter of 2011 ($0.06 per diluted share). As we expected, our profitability has significantly improved from the first quarter to the second quarter, as price increases for steel mill products caught up with higher raw material costs. We continue to believe that end markets such as automotive, heavy equipment, energy, and general manufacturing have experienced some real demand improvement. These increases in profits were achieved despite the rebalancing by our customers of supply chain inventories, the impact on the manufacturing/auto sector of the devastating Japanese earthquake/tsunami and the lost sales, production and shipments from the weather-related power outages and historic river flooding in North America. The third quarter should not see a continuation of these weather-related issues. Improvement in real demand is most evident in special bar quality, sheet and plate products sold to the manufacturing, industrial and energy sectors. The most challenging markets for our products continue to be those associated with residential and non-residential construction. We do expect continued stability in order rates as raw material prices have been less volatile than in 2010. As is our practice, we will provide qualitative guidance for third quarter 2011 earnings in our second quarter 2011 earnings release."
2011-06-16,Deutsche Bank Updates 6/16,"Deutsche Bank explained a number of updates in a research report published today. Deutsche Bank initiated its coverage of KKR Financial (NYSE: KFN) with a Buy rating and a price target of $12.50. In the report, Deutsche Bank states, KKR Financial continues to give attractive returns, as it makes new investments across its targeted assets and grows its portfolio.The portfolio's net long exposure to floating-rate investments should result in net interest income benefiting from higher LIBOR rates. On Wednesday, KKR Financial closed the day at $9.72. Deutsche Bank initiated a coverage of Willis Group (NYSE: WSH) with a Hold rating and a price target of $44. The report states, The company looks well positioned for strong long term revenue growth, with a global platform, underpenetrated markets and an aggressive sales culture. Essentially flat since ‘07, earnings were hurt by the HRH acquisition, closed in the recession and as P&C rates continued to deteriorate, as well as by $1.8 billion in associated debt and difficulties replacing contingent commissions. On Wednesday, Willis closed the day at $40.79. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) had its rating maintained at Buy and its price target reiterated at $76 in spite of an upward revision to the company's earnings estimates. The report states, Barrick has acquired ~96% of Equinox (Hold, AUD7.80) and will proceed with a compulsory acquisition of remaining shares. 2011 and 2012 revised EPS estimates of $4.86 and $7.40 are 10% and 62% above Bloomberg consensus of $4.42 and $4.58. Equinox deal proves EPS accretive with 2011E and 2012E rising by 4% and 8% respectively. On Wednesday, Barrick closed the day at $43.93. Its shares lost 0.57% in today's pre-market trading, however, to trade around $43.68. Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK) had its rating maintained at Buy and its price target reiterated at $90. The report states, Over the past several weeks, the press (Reuters) has speculated about SWK's involvement in bidding for Securitas Direct, a pan-European Resi Security player. Mgmt's commentary around deals has become increasingly focused around Convergent Security (vs. Infrastructure, Healthcare and Engineered Fastening), and the company has noted that they are interested in deploying cash that is trapped overseas through European M&A. On Wednesday, Stanley Black closed the day at $67.73. ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) had its rating maintained at Hold and its price target reiterated at $38.50.

This figure does not include Baffinland, which has high Fe content ores (75% lump; 65% Fe). MT expects Baffinland to complete env work & feas. study by year-end, at which point will seek Board approval and additional commentary would be given. Shares currently trade at 5x and 8x vs. '12 EBITDA and EPS ests vs. peer group at 6x and 10x. On Wednesday, ArcelorMittal closed the day at $31.49. Its shares lost some value in today's pre-market trading, however, falling 0.64% to $31.29. Alpha Natural Resources (NYSE: ANR) had its rating maintained at Buy and its price target reiterated at $67. The report states, A key strength is the diversity of operations (PRB, NAPP, CAPP) and assets (incl Illinois). It is the #3 global met supplier and #5 overall supplier globally. The purchase of Massey further strengthens its CAPP presence. As well, it has the most export capacity in the US with 25-30m tpy available, with 10m tpy from Gulf Coast ports, which gives it geographic flexibility, as well as improved economics with rising rail freights. Arch Coal (NYSE: ACI) had its rating maintained at Hold and its price target reiterated at $38. The report states, The acquisition of International Coal coincidentally closed today, and on a PF basis, newco will be the 2nd and 10th largest US and global met coal supplier (11m t PF, going to 15m t). In terms of total annual production it will be #2 and #4 in the US and world, respectively. In the US, it will have the second largest reserve base (5.5b t). PF revenue and EBITDA expected to be +$5b and $1.4b in 2011; transaction accretive in '12e. Additional PF guidance will be provided in July. Patriot Coal (NYSE: PCX) had its rating maintained at Buy and its price target reiterated at $34. In the report, Deutsche Bank states, Amidst recent M&A uptick, PCX views itself as a consolidator in the space, as originally envisioned post-BTU spinoff. Attractive targets would need to be earnings accretive in near-term. M&A preference is for met assets, but could be hindered by recent valuation; overseas assets could be attractive, with thermal mines lower on the list of priority should price outlook improve. PCX feels that organic growth and select acquisitions, especially in met, is preferable over share buyback. On Wednesday, Patriot Coal closed the day at $20.36. Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) had its rating maintained at Buy and its price target reiterated at $85. The report states, Newmont management provided good detail on their recently announced 6‐ year target to reach 7m oz of gold production by 2017 (ie, 7/17 plan) which would imply a CAGR of ~6% from 2011 mid-point guidance of 5.2m oz versus consensus view that the company is ex-growth... As a result, we believe the pendulum continues to swing more in favor of a share buy-back given management's firm belief in the disconnect between its share price and underlying fundamentals. On Wednesday, Newmont closed the day at $52.31. Its shares lost some value in today's pre-market trading, however, falling 0.11% to $52.25. Nucor (NYSE: NUE) had its rating maintained at Buy and its price target reiterated at $52.

NUE cited sequential improvement due to rising prices catching up with higher material costs. Meanwhile, production, shipments & orders declined q/q. Weather related disruptions on several Southeast facilities (Decatur/Yamato/ Hickman) contributed most, followed by supply chain invs rebalancing and ongoing Jpn supply chain impact. On Wednesday, Nucor closed the day at $39.80. In today's pre-morning trading, its shares rose 1.16% to $40.26, however. Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) had its rating maintained at Buy and its price target reiterated at $60. The report states, Goldcorp highlighted during its presentation that it is a gold company and will remain such and does not expect to diversify into copper or any precious metals (i.e., silver, palladium or platinum) other than via by-product credits. Company also provided compelling evidence of share price outperformance (+892%) vs gold prices (+480%) over the past 10 years, likely the only gold major that can claim that... Goldcorp has differentiated itself given its high quality asset base, aggressive portfolio management (acquiring value-enhancing assets and disposing non-core properties) and execution. On Wednesday, Goldcorp closed the day at $47.77. Its shares added 0.15% to their value in today's pre-market trading, however, to trade around $47.84."

2011-06-20,Goldman Sachs Bullish On Steel ,"Goldman Sachs is getting bullish on the steel space. It is bullish on Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), Schnitzer Steel (NASDAQ: SCHN), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Reliance Steel (NYSE: RS) & Metals USA Holdings Corp (NYSE: MUSA). In a note to clients, Goldman writes, We see five reasons to be short term tactically positive on the steel sector: (1) the steel price decline appears to have halted at a reasonably high level; (2) raw material prices, particularly scrap, are defying the typical seasonal pattern and have either increased or remained relatively stable, thus providing cost support; (3) demand appears to be stable and early signs are that auto production could be stable in (seasonally slow) summer months as automobile parts supply chain has gradually recovered from the Japan earthquake; (4) inventories at the service center and end users are low which should keep order rates steady, and (5) steel stocks have significantly corrected and are down around 25% since mid-February compared to S&P down 7%. We believe that commentaries from the companies during their 2Q conference calls are likely to point to some optimism."

2011-07-26,Till Debt Do Us Part,"One minute we hear that the politicians are close to a debt ceiling increase deal and then another minute we hear that they are not. The stock market only cares about certainty. This afternoon, we have seen small buy programs hit the stock market throughout the trading session only to find out it was simply a false rumor that caused the intra-day spike. This tells us that the stock market is just dying to pop higher on any debt ceiling deal announcement. Here is the problem, everyone is now waiting for a debt ceiling rally. Therefore, any debt ceiling rally that the markets get could simply be short lived. Remember the old stock market adage, when everyone expects the same thing rarely will it happen. Traders are some of the smartest people around. For example, most good experienced traders can tell when the markets are setting up to rally or break down. It still amazes me how traders do not run the world, it would be a much better place. Right now, traders are looking for a debt deal to get done, if they were not these markets would be tanking lower. So we should expect a deal of some sort to get done very soon. The big question that we must ask is, will the debt deal be a sell the news event? This is very possible after a short term rally or bounce. How many times do we see a stock surge higher after an earnings report or positive news only to come back down to earth in the next few trading days. This happens very often when everyone is expecting the good news. Right now, there are so many traders and investors expecting a debt ceiling increase that the move could be short lived. Just think about it, how could raising the debt ceiling be good for the economy? When is debt accumulation no longer a positive for the stock market? These will be the next set of questions that will be asked by traders and investors after this debt deal is settled. Traders should simply expect more volatility over the next few weeks. No one really knows how long a debt ceiling bounce will last. What we do know is, the more people that expect a massive rally to take place after the debt ceiling announcement the more crowded and short term that rally might be. Traders should also take note of the weakness in many of the leading steel stocks today. Stocks such as U.S. Steel Corp.(NYSE: X), AK Steel Holdings Corp.(NYSE: AKS), and Nucor Corp.(NYSE: NUE) are getting crushed today. This is not a good sign for a strong economic outlook. These stocks are not holding up at all compared to the major stock indexes. Don't expect the debt ceiling deal rally to last too long. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"
2011-08-05,Steel Names Looking to go Positive,"Like most stocks, shares of steelmakers have undergone a huge reversal in today's session. Shares of Arcelor Mittal (NYSE: MT), which had traded as low as $24.52 (52-week low) earlier in the session, are currently trading up 1.3% from yesterday's close to $25.74. Shares of Nucor (NYSE: NUE), which had traded as low as $33.86 (52-week low), are currently trading up 0.5% from yesterday's close to $35.12. There may be some room left to go, however, as a few names are still stuck in negative territory. Shares of United States Steel (NYSE: X), which hit a 52-week low of $31.70 earlier in the session, are still trading down 1.1% (42 cents) to $33.45. Shares of AK Steel (NYSE: AKS), which hit a 52-week low of $8.58 earlier in the session, are still trading down 1.6% (16 cents) to $9.07. If the rally continues into the close, these two names could hold the biggest upside potential of any of the steel stocks."

2011-08-23,When The Dollar Pops the Markets Drop,"Once again, the major stock market indexes have given up the early pre-market gains. The decline in the futures market took place as soon as the U.S. Dollar Index began to trade higher. Traders and investors have seen this inverse relationship between the U.S. Dollar Index and the major stock market indexes over the past few years. If you watch a chart of the U.S. Dollar Index this morning, you will see that the stock market indexes simply decline lower as the U.S. Dollar Index rallies off of its morning lows. All traders must keep a close eye on the U.S. Dollar Index at all times. Traders must remember that the most sensitive industry groups to the U.S. Dollar will be the energy and industrial metals sectors. Whenever the U.S. Dollar Index trades higher these industry groups will usually come under pressure. Traders should watch for leading stocks such as Chevron Corp.(NYSE: CVX), Southern Copper Corp.(NYSE: SCCO), and Nucor Corp.(NYSE: NUE) to all come under pressure if the U.S. Dollar Index continues to gain strength this morning. The opposite effect is likely to occur if the U.S. Dollar Index declined or pulled back at some point throughout the trading session. The U.S. Dollar Index chart should be followed by every trader at this time. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"

In a note to clients, Morgan Stanley writes, Despite the recent sell-off, we think it is too early to buy the group as a whole. We would invest selectively, and recommend AKS ($8.18), our top pick, for stock-specific reasons, and NUE ($32.61), an upgrade, as a defensive play with considerable upside. Our new base case incorporates slower steel demand growth in 2H11 and 2012. We are trimming our estimates (by 18% on average) and price targets (by 22% on average). We are rotating into NUE and out of X ($27.25) and STLD ($11.67). Despite large upside to our X and STLD price targets, NUE's Sharpe, Treynor and base/bear ratios point to better risk-adjusted returns. We believe NUE's variable and low cost structure, more solid balance sheet and high dividend yield will support the shares near current levels. Shares of NUE closed at $32.61 yesterday."

2011-09-08,How To Play President Obama's Speech,"Tonight is the big night, with President Obama giving his jobs speech before a joint session of Congress in an effort to spur the sluggish American economy. While some details of the speech have leaked out, there is some hope that Obama and his administration still have some policies that we have not heard mentioned before. Otherwise, there is not too much to get excited about from tonight's speech. Last month, we had 0 new jobs created in this country. That is pathetic, and the first time it has happened since the end of World War 2. Obama's speech has to be long on ideas, and short on rhetoric, otherwise, we could be in for more months like August. Worse, we could even see months where we lose jobs, as we did during the financial crisis of 2008. If Obama's policies are not immediately attacked by the Republicans, and there is a fair amount of common ground, then perhaps we can get some kind of job growth in this country. Yes, we still need the housing sector to rebound to give us any kind of traction, but something is better than 0. We are probably not going to hear anything about the housing sector in tonight's speech, but we will all be listening. He will make the case very aggressively that measures he puts forward ... are the kinds of things that will help spur economic growth, that will lead to greater and faster job creation in the United States, White House spokesman Jay Carney said yesterday. Much of the talk seems to be centered on perhaps an infrastructure bank, tax cuts for the middle class, and transfer payments from the federal government to state and local governments to help with constant deficits. With the recent Solyndra bankruptcy fresh in many people's minds, there may not be anything said about alternative energy, but this is an issue that Obama has talked about extensively. The reason? Obama sees alternative energy as his dot-com era. Everyone always talks about how President Clinton had a budget surplus, superior employment, and a raging stock market. Well, that's because we were ushering in a new era known as the dot com era. We have not seen that kind of innovation in years, and Obama was hoping that alternative energy would be similar. So far, it has failed, and failed miserably. There has been much talk about an infrastructure bank, and while Obama may suggest that tonight, it is incredibly hard to implement. It will take years to get up and running. That is the reason why no President ever really pushes hard for it. They know they will not see the fruits of their labor in the near-term, so why bother? In total, Obama's package could cost anywhere from $300 billion to $400 billion, so obviously there are ways to play it. Here are a few ways to profit off of Obama's job speech. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that Obama's infrastructure plan will gain approval from both sides might want to consider the following trades:It should benefit companies like Cemex (NYSE: CX), U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), and Nucor (NYSE: NUE), which provide products to help rebuild the country's roads and bridges. If he does mention anything about alternative energy, it could help companies like First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR). Bearish:Traders who believe that Obama's speech will be more of the same may consider alternate positions:None of the details leaked so far are inspiring. It is just more of the same policies. If Obama fails to deliver, we could see the U.S. dollar (NYSE: UUP) move to the upside, and bonds (NYSE: TLT) benefit as there does not appear to be any silver bullet in the speech.

2011-09-13,This Chart  Continues To Dominate Every Market Move,"Yesterday's late afternoon rally was being accredited to the Chinese buying Italian debt. Whether or not this is true remains to be seen. What is true and did happen was the late afternoon decline in the U.S. Dollar Index. As we all know by now, when the U.S. Dollar Index dips the major stock market indexes flip. Everything inflated higher yesterday afternoon as the U.S. Dollar Index declined into the closing bell. Traders and investors must continue to follow the U.S. Dollar Index very closely once the opening bell rings at the New York Stock Exchange each and everyday. The energy and commodity sectors are most sensitive to the U.S. Dollar Index. Stocks such as Southern Copper Corp.(NYSE: SCCO), Nucor Corp.(NYSE: NUE), and U.S. Steel Corp.(NYSE: X) will usually trade inverse to the U.S. Dollar Index. This morning, all of these stocks are just stalling after advancing higher yesterday afternoon. Should the U.S. Dollar Index begin to move higher this morning it would be prudent to expect these stocks to pullback or decline intra-day. The U.S. Dollar Index futures (DX U1) will have some short term intra-day support around the $$76.80 level. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"

2011-09-28,There Is Only One Way To Get It Up,"As you may know, the major stock market indexes have been struggling since topping out in May 2011. Since that time, there has only been one way to get this market to trade higher; the U.S. Dollar Index has to decline. That's right, unless the U.S. Dollar Index sells off or declines the stock markets cannot seem to trade higher. In fact, when the U.S. Dollar Index strengthens everything deflates and trades lower. Several months ago when oil and commodity prices were soaring higher it was simply because the U.S. Dollar Index was weak and making new lows. Now that the U.S. Dollar Index has traded off the August lows by $4.00 the markets drop on any U.S. Dollar pop. Leading energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM), and Chevron Corp (NYSE: CVX) have rolled over as soon as the U.S. Dollar Index caught a bid. Today, leading commodity stocks such as Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF), Southern Copper Corp (NYSE: SCCO), and Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE) are all selling off sharply as the U.S. Dollar Index trades higher on the session. Traders can watch for intra-day resistance on the U.S. Dollar Index around the $78.52 level and more resistance around the $78.75 area. Remember, when the U.S. Dollar Index rallies the major stock indexes will decline. The only way this market trades higher is when the dollar dips. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"
2011-10-06,4 Market Sectors Due for a Rebound,"The last two months have been a roller coaster ride for the stock market. The Dow Jones has risen and fallen, and a lot of investors are unclear about whether we are still in a bull market or have regressed into a secular bear market. Either way, certain sectors have dropped dramatically and represent buying opportunities for value investors. Let's take a look at a few of the sectors most punished in recent weeks. 1. Commodities All of the gold bulls have run for the hills as the precious metal has retreated from the $1,900 an ounce level. Gold has seen a massive sell off down to $1,600, which is surprising considering how much fear there has been in the marketplace. Silver prices have tumbled as well along with other metals. Oil has not been immune to the selloff either as prices have fallen below the $80 mark and were as low as $75 a barrel. The global drop in commodities has created a buying opportunity for those who were looking for an entry point to get into oil and gold after their multi-year runs. 2. Metals The steel sector has been heavily sold off and the expectation of another recession has left investors fearful that demand will not return to this sector for a long time. Companies like U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) are priced very low based on the potential earnings power they have in a normal economy. As long as the sentiment remains bearish on the sector, steel stocks will remain weak. However, it will be important to pay attention to manufacturing numbers to get a clue as to the outlook for these companies. The automakers can provide valuable guidance as to the overall demand for steel. 3. Technology The technology sector is a surprise addition to the list. This sector typically holds up well because technology companies usually have strong balance sheets. However, even strong companies like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) have recently seen investors sell their holdings. Fears loom regarding whether big technology names like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) and Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM) can revive their struggling sales numbers. Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) also has been a major drag on the sector as its stock has basically collapsed in recent weeks. 4. Financials Financial stocks are still the dogs of the S&P 500 as investors remain skeptical about the prospects of several big banks. Worries over pending lawsuits and potential capital raises caused big losses for Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Citigroup (NYSE: C), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS). Prices of a number of the big banks appear cheap but could fall lower if the economy languishes further. Financial stocks are the epitome of uncertainty in a market that is in need of clarity, and investors need to be extremely cautious before going bottom feeding in this sector. Final Thoughts Sometimes the worst performers in a market in one quarter can turn out to be the best performers in the market the next. In fact, it could be happening now. But as with any investment, do your due diligence to best determine which of these value sectors hold the most appeal before investing. Mark Riddix is an investment management professional.

2011-12-09,Nucor Closed Near its 200 Day; Priceline Setting Up for a Break Out?,"New York, December 9th (TradersHuddle.com) – After stocks tumbled in the prior session amid dwindling optimism around the EU summit, which spurred a risk off trade, we identified the following trading ideas. Shares of Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE) closed at $39.58 near to its 200-day moving average currently set at $39.78. Nucor's price action is just below this key support level, which makes the stock difficult to buy, as there will certainly be resistance as it approaches its 200day moving average. The latest price action range, defined by a peaks and troughs algorithm places calculated support at $35.25 and calculated resistance at $41.57. Traders are closely watching these levels, as they provide great reference points for the latest price dynamics in Nucor shares. Traders should evaluate their trade if they want to establish a position on Nucor given the resistance could materialize as the stock approaches the 200day moving average, particularly as today Wall Street was poised to stage a rebound. A trade might materialize as the stock manages to break this important level, as it could be used as support going forward, however until the break materializes, traders need to exercise patience. Other levels that traders will be evaluating are the ones defined by the peak and troughs algorithm that provides great price action reference points. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) manufactures carbon and alloy steel, steel joists, steel deck, cold finished steel, steel grinding balls, steel bearing products, and metal building systems. The company is based in Charlotte, NC. Another idea is priceline.com (NASDAQ: PCLN). The name your price online Travel Company closed the prior session at $479.26. Price action is in a very tight range, given that calculated support is set at $472.00 and the calculated resistance based on an algorithm of peaks and troughs is set at $498.82 Priceline's stock price action indicates that both sellers and buyers are materializing very close to each other, which is indicative to a momentum building area, as the stock can resolve by breaking out of the tight range that developed. Traders wanting to establish a position should place close attention to Priceline's price action, as any movement outside its predefined range could spur momentum buyers, looking for a big movement in the price of the stock. However the tight range resolution works both ways, hence, a move below support at $472.00 could spark above average selling. A tiered approach can be a good way to start a long position in Priceline, by establishing a starter position while the stock is in the tight range, and then adding to the position as it breaks and closes above resistance."
2011-12-09,Dividend Aristocrat Changes Alter ETF's Lineup,"Standard & Poor's is making some additions to the prestigious Dividend Aristocrats Index, home to large-cap blue chips that have boosted shareholder payouts every year for at least 25 consecutive years. Ten new companies, including Dow component and telecom giant AT&T (NYSE: T) will be added to the index and that could mean some changes are in store for the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF (NYSE: SDY).

2011-12-30,"Bank of America Views Sparrows Point Shutdown as Potentially Positive for AKS, X, STLD, NUE","Bank of America published a research report on yesterday on US Steel, noting that private RG Group's recent shutdown at Sparrows Point could be potentially positive for other companies in the steel sector. In the report, Bank of America writes, Media reports over the long holiday weekend indicate RG Group's 3M+ t/yr Sparrows Point at least partly shut operations and issued layoff notices to employees. The mill was reportedly struggling to pay bills despite rising steel prices and lower iron ore prices in recent months. Customers we spoke with were still unclear on the status of existing orders. Sparrows may be still shipping to them, but if not, the market could tighten as buyers scramble to replace tons they had ordered. A permanent or even temporary closure of the mill, also called the “Beast from the East,” can likely help balance the oversupplied U.S. flat-rolled market. Bank of America goes on to say that, Concern over excess sheet supply in the U.S. market has been one of our main reasons for being cautious on producers such as U.S. Steel, AK Steel, and Steel Dynamics, although we have also been wary of stretched balance sheets and pension issues. Recent price hikes would take benchmark hot rolled coil (HRC) sheet prices up about $150/short ton to at least $740-750/t. Our forecast remains at $740/t for H1 2012. We think the removal of Sparrows' extra tons can help support the recent price hikes, at least through the next several months. Attractively priced imported tons offered from Russia, Italy, and Korea at more than $100/t below domestic prices are available for late February and March, but until then we see potential outperformance from the group. Higher iron ore prices and a weaker dollar can be positive, while the opposite can pressure steel prices.

2011-12-30,Could Steel Be A Steal?,"Sparrows Point in Baltimore County, Maryland, once housed the world's largest steel mill. However, times have changed, and just recently RG Steel announced that it would be laying off over 700 employees at its Sparrows Point plant. RG Steel, a private company, bought the plant last spring as part of a deal that cost the company $1.2 billion. GE Capital, a division of General Electric (NYSE: GE), loaned RG Steel $750 million to help complete the deal. The recent layoffs were precipitated by internal changes within GE Capital designed to boost the financial services company's reserves, which has had severe negative effects on RG Steel's liquidity. The news of the layoffs sent shock waves throughout the steel industry. No one is sure exactly how this will affect sheet supply in the U.S. in the near-term future. That said, the U.S. steel market has been suffering from excess sheet supplies for some time. Bank of America and others have noted that RG Steel's troubles could be a boon for other steel companies. Below are four companies that could benefit from the partial shut down of RG Steel's Sparrows Point plant, most of which were hit quite hard earlier in the year: 1. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) Market Cap: $910.87 million P/E: - AK Steel is a midwest-based company that produces electrical and stainless steels, including steel for automakers. The company's stock is down almost 50% year-to-date, but it appears that it may be poised for a rebound. Just recently, AK Steel announced a $50 per ton price increase for carbon steel products. However, if the company's stock does see a dramatic rise, this would hurt the shares' yields, which are currently attractive at 2.42%. 2. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) Market Cap: $3.81 billion P/E: - United States Steel is one of the world's top steel companies, and is capable of producing over 30 million net tons of raw steel annually. Like AK Steel, United States Steel is down over 50% year-to-date. That said, the company's stock has been on the rise over the last couple of months, a general trend in the steel market. Strong car sales would help the company. 3. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) Market Cap: $2.88 billion P/E: 11.68 Steel Dynamics is both a steel producer and metal recycler. The company announced its expected fourth quarter earnings this month, pegging earnings at $0.08 to $0.12 a share. That's higher than last year's fourth quarters earning, but lower than their third quarter 2011 earnings. The company also declared a $0.10 dividend per common share. The stock closed Friday at $13.15, and has a $20.70 52 week high. 4. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) Market Cap: $12.53 billion P/E: 20.01 Nucor Corporation produces steel and steel products, and is heavily involved in the manufacturing of sheet steel. The company shares are down only 9.7% year-to-date, which is a significantly stronger performance than the other companies in this list. While this is a positive, it suggests that the company may not have as much potential as a buy low “steal” as the other companies mentioned. However, it's as poised as any other steel company to benefit from RG Steel's troubles. Bullish View:Traders who believe that news on RG Steel will improve inventory turnover in the steel industry may want to consider the following: Go long on the aforementioned companies via shares or call options.Buy into Market Vectors Steel Index ETF (SLX), or perhaps PowerShares Global Steel Portfolio (PSTL) for traders that believe the news will have broader global implications. Bearish View:Traders who believe that the news on RG Steel won't improve inventory turnover in the steel industry might consider the following:Short the companies listed above, which may be a good play if demand for steel is low.Short Market Vectors Steel Index ETF and other steel ETFs, or pursue options strategies to hedge current investment.Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2012-01-05,Nucor Announces Plan to Close Nuconsteel ,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today that it will exit the business of fabricating light gauge steel framing and therefore will close its Nuconsteel division. Nuconsteel has operations in Denton, Texas, and Dallas, Georgia. Nucor entered the residential and commercial light gauge steel framing business in November 2001 with the acquisition of Itec Steel, Inc., which became Nuconsteel shortly thereafter. Nucor expects to close Nuconsteel's facilities in the spring of 2012, after meeting current customer contractual obligations."
2012-01-18,Bank of America Positive on US Steel Sector,"Bank of America has published a research report on the US Steel Sector after reports show that December distribution shipments have fallen. In the report, Bank of America writes, Dec steel shipments fell 14.7% daily compared with a historical 12.7% m/m decline. Flat-rolled and plate shipments fell the most of the carbon products, down 16.6% and 13.4% respectively on a days-adj basis m/m. Tubular shipments fell the least, down 7.7% m/m. Stainless steel shipments fell 15.8% m/m but were up 4.6% y/y. Weak stainless demand has been an overhang on U.S. producers ATI and AKS but we anticipate restocking in 2012 given the low I/S ratio. Meanwhile, aluminum shipments fell 13.8% m/m on a days-adj basis but were up 13.1% y/y. Steel market mixed signals have confused investors as the Sparrows Point mill idled and is restarting and scrap rose then retreated again. However, we still expect the group to outperform near term as we think investor expectations are too low and upcoming Q1 outlooks should be quite positive. Sparrows should take time to restart, and scrap is just correcting to a still elevated level given the mild winter. Any weather-related disruption or Chinese rebound after its easing could further strengthen the steel thesis. Companies related to this report include: AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) Neutral Allegheny Tech (NYSE: ATI) Buy Nucor (NYSE: NUE) Buy Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) Buy"
2012-01-24,Steel Stocks Refuse To Bend,"This afternoon, all of the leading steel stocks are holding up very well. The strength in the steel sector is partly coming from a weaker U.S. Dollar Index. All traders should remember that anything that contains a metal will benefit from a weak dollar. Leading steel stocks such as U.S. Steel Corp (NYSE: X), Nucor Corp (NYSE: NUE), AK Steel Holdings Corp (NYSE: AKS), and Steel Dynamics Inc (NASDAQ: STLD) remain strong on the daily charts. These stocks look as if they could have a little more upside in the near term. It is important for traders to realize that U.S. Steel Corp (NYSE: X) is the leading stock in this industry group. This stock should have important daily chart resistance around the $30.00 level. Short term traders can watch for intra-day resistance around the $28.90, and $29.30 levels.

2012-01-27,UPDATE: Credit Suisse Raises Target to $53 on Nucor,"Credit Suisse maintains its Outperform rating on Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and raises its price target to $53 (previously $43) as sectors served by the company have shown signs of revitalization. Credit Suisse says, NUE has significant exposure to many facets of the U.S. economy, with autos comprising ~10% of total revenues and energy +10% for many of its products. Coupled with the expansion of NUE's SBQ capabilities announced yesterday, we believe investors should focus on the positive developments at Nucor in the coming years, including 1) cost improvements through the Louisiana DRI plant (still on-schedule for mid-2013 rampup), 2) margin expansion through the SBQ expansion, and 3) derisking, through the expansion of product offerings (Berkeley County) and increased customer diversification. NUE closed at $44.13 a share yesterday."
2012-02-01,Stocks Of Steel: The Best Plays For Resurgent Steel,"Few sectors are as intimately tied to the health of the global economy as steel. This high-beta group was taken to the woodshed last year as global investors fretted about a confluence of negative factors, namely Europe's sovereign debt crisis, emerging markets demand and slack growth in the U.S. It's a pretty simple equation really. Skittish market environment + negative macroeconomic factors = Bad news for steel demand and the performance of steel stocks. Name a steel stock and chances are it embodied that negative scenario in 2011. Just look at Hyman Roth's favorite stock, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X). If flirted with $55 in May before dropping below $19 in October. Fast forward to January 2012, and it looks like the darkest clouds have passed for steel stocks and catalysts exist for further gains. The real estate market is one of those catalysts. Some help from Detroit's big industry won't hurt either. Demand for steel pipes and related fare by energy producers is expected to remain robust and any improvement in Europe's sovereign debt situation will help. We are still fairly optimistic about global growth in 2012 based on continued sluggish exit from recession in the West along with slower, but still high, growth in the emerging markets. Mid-2012 is seen as the most likely timing for any real improvement at global level, according to GFMS. Consider these names for a steel resurgence in 2012: Nucor (NYSE: NUE) Nucor is the largest U.S. steelmaker and recycler and it has an added bonus that rivals like U.S. Steel do not have. A decent yield. Yes, Nucor's dividend is a shell of what it was before the financial crisis, but the company is at least making efforts to increase the payout and the yield currently rests at 3.3%. When it comes to cyclical companies, management matters and that's another reason to like Nucor. CEO Dan DiMicco might be the best in the business. The shares could be considered overbought here, so either start with a small position or wait for a pullback. AK Steel Holding (NYSE: AKS) With a market cap just over $1 billion, AK Steel is treading in small-cap territory. Then again, if the risk on trade is really back on, then small-cap cyclicals are a good place to be. AK trades at just 6.7 times forward earnings (cheaper than Nucor on that basis). AK can be bought in the $9.50-$9.75 area with an eye on a move to $11. Schnitzer Steel Industries (Nasdaq: SCHN) While AK Steel and Nucor have turned in impressive double-digit year-to-date performances, Schnitzer has been a laggard with a gain of just 3.2%. Don't let that deter you from Schnitzer, which engages in recycling ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals. As Bret Jensen notes The company is selling near the bottom of its five-year valuation range based on P/B, P/S and P/CF and insiders have been net buyers of the stock over the last six months. Remember, there's only one reason insider buy their company's stock: Because they think it's going up. Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) Maybe it's good to be indecisive about steel stocks because the indecisive among us may have opted for the Market Vectors Steel ETF over an individual steel stock. Good call because year-to-date, SLX has outperformed AK Steel, Nucor and U.S. Steel. SLX, the first U.S.-listed ETF devoted exclusively to steel stocks, isn't just about U.S. companies. In fact, almost 56% of SLX's country weight is allocated outside the U.S. That includes a 20% allocation to Brazil and another 11% combined to South Korea and Russia. Mining giants Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), Vale (NYSE: VALE) and ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) represent over 28% of the ETF's weight. SLX is pushing $57, but an extended risk on environment gets it back to $70s."
2012-02-03,Economic Optimism Propels Strong January For Steel Stocks,"Better than expected economic numbers along with improving sentiment about the prospects of the global economy helped steel stocks to post strong returns in January. One of the strongest performers in the sector over the last month has been Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), which has risen better than 17%. The company released its earnings report on January 24, beating analysts' consensus earnings per share estimates by $0.04. In the wake of this strong report, STLD shares have continued to gain momentum. Another strong performer in the steel sector has been Nucor (NYSE: NUE). That stock is up better than 12% over the last month and has been rising nearly every day. Although over the last 52-weeks, NUE shares are still down around 6%, the stock has been in a strong uptrend over the last 6 months, with the trend accelerating in January. Nucor released a strong quarterly earnings report on January 26, with EPS handily beating analysts' consensus, which appears to have buoyed optimism about the company's forward looking prospects. In January, global steel producer ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) also saw its share price rise. The stock has gained a little less than 10% over the last month, although shares are still down more than 40% versus a year ago. Shares closed Friday's trading session at $21.74 which compares to a 52-week high in the name of $38.50. If the consensus outlook for the global economy continues to improve, look for MT's recent uptrend to accelerate as the year progresses. The stock trades at a trailing P/E of 14.44, a forward P/E of 9.66 and a PEG ratio of 0.54 - on a valuation basis, this name looks relatively inexpensive. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) shares also posted strong gains in January and have risen more than 14% over the last month. Like the other steel names, the last 52-weeks have been disappointing, with the stock down almost 47%, but the trend has definitely turned up in X. Furthermore, the rally could gain steam in February if sentiment and the broader market cooperate. U.S. Steel (X) has a very large short interest, with almost 24% of the company's float sold short, and a short-squeeze is definitely a possibility if traders begin to conclude that the bottom is in for the steel sector and that the global economy is about to pick up steam. AK Steel (NSYE:AKS) has added 2.57% over the last month and has been a laggard among the steel stocks. Similar to U.S. Steel, however, AKS has a very large short interest (20.66%) and could benefit from short covering if the market continues to ramp higher. Both AKS and X would appear to be good candidates for traders looking to put on a high risk/reward trade that will benefit from a bullish future outlook for the domestic and international economy. Steel stocks are extremely sensitive to changes in sentiment, and the high short interest in these names could provide greater upside than some less shorted names in the event of a continued rally in the steel sector."

2012-03-14,Nucor is a Strong Candidate for the American Values Model,"American Values Investments, American Heroes Investment Model Author: Carter LeCraw, American Values Investments Covestor model: American Heroes Disclosure: No position in SCSC for Covestor model at time of writing 2011 was another year of high volatility. In spite of the political rhetoric and doomsday predictions for the Eurozone, both of which continue, the US economy managed to plug along and domestic stock markets zoomed during the fourth quarter of 2011. Some say manufacturing in America is going the way of the Edsel, but Nucor's (NUE) dedicated team of employees might take exception to that premise. Nucor, our nation's largest steel producer, is an excellent example of how building a company on principles and values, even in a tough industry, can cause the practical pundits to eat their words. As most would agree a strong manufacturing base is extremely important to a healthy America. Yes, cheap labor in other countries makes them attractive to companies seeking to lower product costs, but what is too often discounted is American ingenuity combined with American values. Nucor is a grand example. They have defied the odds and serve as a beacon of hope to Americans everywhere. Based on our scoring of four important values (integrity, humility, diligence and caring) Nucor has earned the right to be designated as one of our American Hero Companies, and is therefore eligible for potential inclusion in our portfolios. In order to compete in the steel industry Nucor has to be good, really good, at productivity. An innovative and egalitarian approach to operations helps employees feel included, inspired and energized. Even though a multi-billion dollar company, Nucor has a headquarters staff of less than 100 people and just five layers of management. They believe employees, not mangers, drive their success. This does not mean employees are coddled, but challenged and offered significant opportunity. Compensation is based on the old fashioned idea of pay for performance. Employee pay goes up and down based on their team and overall company performance. It is one reason they have survived since management has the flexibility to lower pay during off years. At the same time management is committed to employees. So far, Nucor has not let go any employee because of lack of work. This is almost unheard of in corporate America and a wonderful example of loyalty. This is one more reason why Nucor employees, as a whole, seem to have a high degree of satisfaction and dedication to the company. One employee told a story about a time he and his daughter were driving past his former place of employment. She said, Daddy, that's where you used to work when you was grumpy. Nucor has received numerous awards over the years. In 2010, Nucor's CEO Daniel DiMicco was recognized as one of the Best Performing CEO's in the world and recently, Nucor was included in Fortune's 2012 list of most admired companies. We believe American Hero Companies, like Nucor, help America, by modeling for us and our children values that never go out of style. If they support America and her values, maybe we should support Nucor with our investment dollars. Covestor Ltd. is a registered investment advisor.

2012-03-15,Nucor Sees Q1 EPS of $0.30-0.35,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today guidance for its first quarter ending March 31, 2012. Nucor expects first quarter results to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.35 per diluted share. This performance is consistent with the qualitative guidance presented in our fourth quarter of 2011 earnings release and conference call which stated, We therefore expect earnings in the first quarter of 2012 to be improved from fourth quarter 2011 levels, after adjusting for one-time benefits received in the fourth quarter. This range represents a decrease from the first quarter of 2011 earnings of $0.50 per diluted share and fourth quarter of 2011 earnings of $0.43 per diluted share. Projected first quarter results include an estimated LIFO charge of $14 million ($0.03 per diluted share) compared to charges of $52 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 ($0.11 per diluted share) and $31 million in the first quarter of 2011 ($0.06 per diluted share)."
2012-04-03,Trading Outlook: Steel Stocks,"While the outlook for the global steel industry as a whole has been steadily improving, the share performance of a number of prominent steel producers has been terrible over the last year. For example, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) has lost 45% over the last 52-weeks and ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) has fallen more than 48%. Among the best performing steel names has been Nucor (NYSE: NUE) which has seen its share price rebound along with the broader market in 2012. Nevertheless, NUE shares are still down 7.38% over the last year. Other prominent names include AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD). Both of these stocks remain under pressure, however, as AKS shares have lost more than 50% over the last 52-weeks and STLD is down nearly 23% during the same time period. The performance of these stocks comes despite the fact that world crude steel production hit another all-time record in 2011 with 1,527 million tons being produced for the year. The emergence of China has helped to spur demand for steel after a deep fall off in the wake of the global financial crisis. Not only is China the largest steel consumer, but it is also the largest producer by a wide margin, generating almost half of the world's output at 46% and growing 8.9% year over year. This compares to the United States which generated just 6% of global output in 2011 and was growing at a rate of 7.1%. Given the shifting global output and demand dynamics in the steel industry, the market remains significantly fragmented and highly competitive. In addition, steel stocks are very cyclical and some key markets remain under pressure. In particular, the industry is sensitive to demand from global automakers such as General Motors (NYSE: GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and Toyota (NYSE: TM). Unsurprisingly, share price trends in these names reflect some of the weakness in prominent steel stocks. For example, Ford shares have lost more than 17% over the last year and GM has lost more than 21%. Taken on balance, however, the automaker segment is considerably stronger than the other major steel market which is construction. Coming out of the 2008 recession, the construction industry, and the housing market in particular, has failed to ramp back up to pre-crisis levels and considerable slack remains. This is witnessed by housing starts that continue to remain near historically low levels. While the current construction outlook remains uncertain, increased optimism and activity will be reflected in steel stocks. Given the depressed levels of many prominent names, these stocks could produce significant gains in 2012 if the lingering headwinds in the construction sector continue to show signs of abating. While uncertainty remains the primary theme, steel companies themselves are putting a positive spin on their outlook for 2012. The industry anticipates that volumes will improve in 2012 on recovering demand and a stronger global economy. Furthermore, operating results are expected to show a sharp improvement versus 2011 driven by higher selling prices and shipment volumes. The positive outlook, however, should be tempered by the knowledge that any kind of weakness or increased uncertainty in the global economy will have an immediate effect on the sector. In particular, fears over a slowing Chinese economy could be devastating for steel producers. Investors also should be aware of other headwinds such as persistently high raw material costs which steel producers have a difficult time passing on to customers amid a tepid demand backdrop. Furthermore, the steel industry continues to suffer from overcapacity, particularly in China. As a result, the world market has been flooded with cheap steel and this development has been a burden for U.S. producers. Despite the risks, however, the steel sector is very interesting given its sharp under-performance. As a result, buying steel stocks which are trading at relatively depressed levels may be one of the best ways to express an aggressively bullish thesis on the global economy. Because end markets for the industry are still under pressure despite a clear improvement in worldwide economic conditions, the sector has lagged most other areas of the market. If sentiment and economic growth were to continue to ramp sharply in the coming years, steel stocks could be among the best performers given current valuations."

2012-06-11,AK Steel Holdings Falls Sharply After Downgrade,"AK Steel Holdings (NYSE: AKS) has decreased about 13% on the session. As stated in a Wall Street Journal Article, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) downgraded AKS from a Neutral to a Sell rating. Goldman Sachs may have downgraded AKS because of a highly leveraged balance sheet, having $1.1 billion in debt compared to $576 million in equity. AKS only has $42 million in cash, making it difficult to pay off debt. According to a Wall Street Journal Article, Goldman Sachs stated, “Half way through 2012, it is becoming evident that this is shaping up to be a tough year for the steel sector, and 2H could get even tougher, especially for flat rolled products. China's daily steel output has decreased in May, which has led to a decrease in the demand for steel. The decrease of the price of steel in China could be having a negative effect on the steel sector and a contributing factor to the low prices in flat steel. Competitors of AKS such as, United States Steel (NYSE: X), Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD), have all seen losses on the day. AK Steel Holdings is currently trading at about $5.06."
2012-06-13,Nucor Sees Q2 EPS of $0.35-0.40 Including Items ,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today guidance for its second quarter ending June 30, 2012. Nucor expects second quarter results to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.40 per diluted share. These projected results include an expected impairment charge related to our Duferdofin Nucor S.r.l. joint venture of approximately $30 million ($0.09 per diluted share). This performance, excluding the expected impairment charge, is somewhat below the qualitative guidance presented in our first quarter earnings release and conference call which stated, For the second quarter of 2012, we currently expect to see only a modest improvement in earnings. Excluding the impact of the impairment charge, this range is lower than 2011 second quarter earnings of $0.94 per diluted share and is similar to the first quarter of 2012 earnings of $0.46 per diluted share. Projected second quarter results include an estimated LIFO credit of $14.5 million ($0.03 per diluted share) compared to charges of $14.5 million in the first quarter of 2012 ($0.03 per diluted share) and $32 million in the second quarter of 2011 ($0.06 per diluted share)."
2012-06-18,Steel Stocks Announce Weak Guidance Amid Slowing Demand,"The steel industry continues to suffer from overcapacity, particularly in China. As a result, the world market has been flooded with cheap steel, burdening U.S. steel producers. End markets for the industry, including the auto industry, are still under pressure despite a clear improvement in worldwide economic conditions. As a result, the steel sector has lagged most other areas of the market year to date. So, investors should not be surprised that steel stocks are seeing increased pressure during Monday's trading session. On Friday after the market close, Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) announced weak second quarter guidance and, Monday morning, AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) also announced weak guidance. Steel Dynamics provided second quarter earnings guidance in the range of $0.15 to $0.20 per diluted share, which was worse than analysts' consensus estimates of $0.24. These second quarter 2012 estimated results are somewhat lower than the $0.20 per diluted share reported for the first quarter 2012 (which included January refinancing charges of $0.03 per diluted share), and lower than the $0.43 per diluted share reported for the second quarter of 2011. The company stated that its somewhat weak guidance is primarily the result of decreased sheet steel pricing, attributable to supply-side pressures from increased imports and increased domestic steel capacity. However, the company also mentioned that sheet steel demand quantities are relatively stable, including strength in the automotive, energy, construction equipment and agricultural sectors. Monday morning, AK Steel said it expects to generate second quarter net income between $0.04 and $0.06 per diluted share, which is lower than analysts' consensus estimate of $0.11. The company stated that this soft guidance is due to increased uncertainty and volatility with respect to near-term economic conditions in the United States and in other markets served by the company, including a recent deterioration in spot market pricing. Shares of most steel companies traded down on the session; however, Steel Dynamics traded close to flat for the day. AK Steel traded down around 4.5%, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) traded down about 3.6%, and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) was down about 1.3%."

2012-07-20,"UPDATE: Credit Suisse Reiterates Outperform Rating, Raises PT on Nucor Corporation","In a report published Friday, Credit Suisse Group reiterated its Outperform rating on Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), and raised its price target from $44.00 to $45.00. Credit Suisse noted, “While global macro uncertainty continues to pervade, we continue to view NUE as a relatively more defensive way to play a potential U.S. recovery over the next 3 years. The steep drop in scrap prices appears to have paused, with the next move in direction likely the most important indicator of where steel prices and NUE shares will move. However NUE continues to push forward on company specific catalysts, including 1) the recent Skyline acquisition (which we estimate to be accretive starting in 2013), 2) the completion of the DRI plant which is on target for 2013, and 3) the ongoing upgrades to existing mill capacity (SBQ capacity, Nucor Yamato expansion, completed vacuum degasser) aimed at increasing the value added product mix. We view Q3 guidance as conservative, and may prove to be the bottom for earnings given the company specific drivers which start to kick in 2H'13.” Nucor Corporation closed on Thursday at $38.23."

2012-09-17,"UPDATE: J.P. Morgan Reiterates Overweight Rating, Lowers PT on Nucor Corporation","In a report published Monday, J.P. Morgan & Co. reiterated its Overweight rating on Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), but slightly lowered its price target from $45.00 to $44.00. J.P. Morgan noted, “We rate shares of Nucor Overweight with a $44 December 2013 target price. Nucor has consistently grown throughout the steel cycle, emerging stronger and more diversified each time—we believe the current cycle is no different. Notably, plans to leverage traditional DRI technology will increase the company's raw material integration while helping reduce the associated volatility by leveraging low natural gas prices. In our view, Nucor's solid balance sheet, flexible cost structure, and continued focus on innovation and growth merit a premium valuation multiple.” Nucor Corporation closed on Friday at $40.75."
2012-11-15,"Soros Adds to Gold Miner ETF Positions, Raises GLD Stake","Billionaire investor George Soros, who as recently as late 2011 said gold was an asset bubble, now appears quite bullish on the yellow metal and the companies that extract it from the earth. During the third quarter, Soros Fund Management LLC added to its investment in the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the second-largest ETF in the world by assets. The firm raised its interest in GLD to 1.3 million shares from 884,400 shares, according to an SEC filing. Even at 1.3 million shares. Soros Fund Management owns a small percentage of GLD's shares outstanding, which stood at 443.2 million as of November 14. The filing also indicates Soros Fund Management has boosted its holdings of ETFs that own shares of gold miners. An August SEC filing showed the firm held 1 million shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and nearly 2.4 million shares of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). The November filing indicates Soros has more than doubled his GDX stake to 2.32 million shares and now holds a sizable chunk of call options on the ETF as well. The firm's position in GDXJ has not changed, according to the filing. Since mid-August, GLD has jumped 6.6 percent while GDXJ has soared 5.7 percent. GDX has risen 3.3 percent over the same time. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) combine for a third of GDX's weight. Soros also slightly added to his position in the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). The firm owned 350,000 shares of XME as of the August filing, but the more recent November filing indicates that stake has risen to 353,400 shares and the firm also owns call options on that ETF. XME does hold some gold miners, but the fund is heavily allocated to coal and steel names such as Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE). Soros also holds a stake in the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) as well as call options on that position. Other ETFs that Soros Fund Management holds interests in according to the November filing include the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP), the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE: KBE) and the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY).

2012-12-18,UPDATE: Bank of America Raises PO to $49 on Nucor Following Guidance  ,"Bank of America reiterated its Buy rating on Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and increased its price objective from $46 to $49 a share. Bank of America noted, NUE guided to Q412 EPS of $0.25-0.30 vs. BofAML at $0.34 and consensus at $0.33. Given its penchant for conservative guidance, we think guidance is in line. Q4 guidance included a $0.06/shr LIFO credit, down vs a $0.16 credit in Q3. … Of the steels, we are most positive on Nucor given its balance sheet and growth initiatives, particularly its direct reduced iron (DRI) facilities in Louisiana, scheduled for start-up mid-2013. Once fully ramped up we estimate a minimum $0.60- 0.75/shr benefit, taking advantage of low natural gas prices relative to coke to produce an iron and scrap input alternative. Nucor closed at $43.50 on Monday."
2012-12-21,"Steel Sector Under Pressure Following $4.3B Impairment Charge from ArcelorMittal, Co. Cited Weak Environment in Europe","ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) today announced it expects to write down the goodwill in its European businesses by approximately US$4.3bn. This follows the completion of its yearly goodwill impairment test, as required by IFRS accounting standards. ArcelorMittal shares are down more than three percent at last check. The write down will take the form of a non-cash impairment charge that will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2012. The impairment is due to a weaker macro economic and market environment in Europe where apparent steel demand has fallen by approximately 8% this year, bringing the cumulative demand decline to approximately 29% since 2007. This weaker demand environment, and expectations that it will persist over the near and medium term, led to a downward revision of cash flow expectations underlying the valuation of the European businesses to which goodwill has been allocated. This is in contrast to the US, where apparent steel consumption is up almost 8% this year and is now approximately 10% lower than it was in 2007. Key metrics such as net debt and ebitda, as well as compliance with debt covenants, are unaffected by this impairment. Additionally, Fitch downgraded ArcelorMittal to BB+ with a Stable outlook. Elsewhere in the sector, AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) shares are down nearly four percent, shares of US Steel (NYSE: X) are down nearly three percent, and shares of Nucor (NYSE: NUE) are down almost two percent."
2013-01-04,S&P Lukewarm on Some Materials ETFs,"Despite signs of slowing growth in some emerging markets, there are also signs the U.S. economy is rebounding and China has delivered plenty of signals in recent weeks that is experiencing a turnaround of its own. That could be just one of the catalysts to lift materials ETFs in 2013, though S&P Capital IQ has a Neutral view of the sector. We foresee monthly PMI data for each of the major economies, including China, continuing to show improvement as the year progresses. In addition, EPS growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 for this S&P 500 sector is expected by Capital IQ consensus estimates to be 3.9% and exceed that for the S&P 500. In 2013, earnings are expected to be similarly strong. Finally, our technical outlook has been raised to neutral with a bullish bias, from neutral with a bearish bias, S&P Capital IQ said in a recent research note. The research firm is somewhat bullish on diversified chemicals firms, which could favor an ETF such as the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYM). Fundamentals for diversified chemicals, the largest sub-industry in the sector, are positive, according the S&P Capital IQ equity analysts. We think the decline in U.S. natural gas prices relative to global crude oil prices has improved the feedstock cost competitiveness of the U.S. petrochemical industry versus other global regions, such as Europe, thus helping boost U.S. industry exports, said S&P Capital IQ. IYM, which is home $543.4 million in assets under management, features Dow component DuPont (NYSE: DD), Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW), Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE: APD) and other chemicals names among its top-10 lineup. S&P rates IYM as Marketweight. The ETF has an annual expense ratio of 0.47 percent. S&P Capital IQ also has a Market-weight rating on the Vanguard Chemicals ETF (NYSE: VAW). Due to a recent fee reduction announced by Vanguard, VAW now has the lowest expense ratio of any materials ETF at 0.14 percent per year. VAW allocates 19.3 percent of its weight to diversified chemicals names, though its largest holding is crop nutrients maker Monsanto (NYSE: MON). S&P is also bullish on diversified metals and mining names. The firm said its equity analysts have a positive fundamental outlook for the next 12 months, as we believe sales and earnings will recover from 2012's depressed levels. Our expectation reflects our view that prices for aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, iron ore and coking coal will rebound from 2012's levels on higher demand and less rapidly rising output. The research firm has a Market-weight rating on the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). That $2.55 billion ETF is includes mining names such as Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) along with Monsanto and DuPoint among its top holdings. S&P is less enthused about the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), which it rates Underweight. With steel stocks such as U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) accounting for over 36 percent of XME's weight, the ETF carries a high beta of 1.67 and is highly dependent on a strong economies in the developed and emerging worlds to drive its returns. Investors should also note XME has an almost 15 percent to beaten down coal and consumable fuels names. For more on materials ETFs, click here."

2013-01-25,"The Week Ahead: Earnings from Facebook, Ford, Caterpillar; US Jobs Report","The last week of January should be a busy one for investors. In addition to several earnings reports from a number of major companies, investors will also get key economic data, including the monthly nonfarm payroll report. Industrial machine maker Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) will report earnings Monday. Analysts expect the company to report an earnings per share figure of $1.70 on revenue of $16.13 billion. Investors should look for Caterpillar's guidance on the Chinese economy, as the company is often seen as a proxy for China's continued industrialization. Car maker Ford (NYSE: F) will report Tuesday. The consensus estimate calls for earnings of $0.26 on revenue of $33.01 billion. Shares of Ford are up significantly over the last three months, having rallied more than 30 percent. Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ: SWKS), a handset chip supplier, reports Wednesday. Shares have been volatile over the last few days, after Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings report may cast some doubt on the growth of the smartphone market. Sterne Agee has a Buy rating on Skyworks and a $30 price target. Vijay Rakesh, Sterne's Skyworks Solutions analyst, believes that the company is poised to benefit from both the iPhone 5 and the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S4. “We believe SWKS is well positioned with the iPhone5 and a new Galaxy S4 ramp in Feb-Mar which should drive a better than seasonal MarQ,” Rakesh writes. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) is also reporting Wednesday. Analysts are anticipating an earnings per share figure of $0.15 on revenue of $1.52 billion. Since the company's disappointing IPO, shares have climbed back, and are up nearly 40 percent in the last three months. Tom Forte, an analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, is bullish on Facebook. He has no rating on the stock, but a $38 price target. “We'll be looking for progress on mobile monetization,” Forte told Benzinga. “They've taken the percentage of ad revenue from mobile up from 0 percent to 14 percent. We think by the fourth quarter of 2013, it could be 25 percent.” Beyond earnings, the market will digest all sorts of economic data points. Investors will get data on new home sales, durable goods orders, consumer confidence, and GDP. Ultimately, it will all lead up to Friday's nonfarm payroll report. Economists are anticipating a gain of 160,000 jobs, along with an unemployment rate of 7.8 percent -- unchanged from last month. On the global front, the currency market remains volatile, particularly the Japanese yen, which has depreciated significantly against the dollar since mid-December.

2013-01-27,Barron's Recap (1/26/12): Made in America,"This weekend in Barron's online: a manufacturing boom in the United States is in its early days, part two of the Barron's 2013 Roundtable picks and pans, and the prospects for Intuitive Surgical, Apple and Ryman Hospitality Properties. Cover Story The Next Boom by Kopin Tan. After decades of outsourcing, the United States is quietly experiencing a manufacturing revival. Inexpensive natural gas and increasingly competitive labor costs are luring factories -- and jobs -- back to American soil. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), Ford Motor (NYSE: F) and General Electric (NYSE: GE) are just a few of the companies making more of their goods at home again. And foreign companies are drawn here by the cheap energy, weak dollar and stagnant wages too. Samsung Electronics plans a semiconductor plant in Texas, Airbus SAS wants a factory in Alabama and Toyota (NYSE: TM) wants to export to Asia minivans made in Indiana. Barron's has identified eight stocks positioned to prosper in this manufacturing upswing, including Southwestern Energy (NYSE: SWN), Nucor (NYSE: NUE), Calpine (NYSE: CPN), CF Industries (NYSE: CF) and Union Pacific (UNP). The effects of this boom may also boost regional lenders, home builders and local small businesses. Abundant gas and a weak dollar are long-term trends, says the article, and wages should behave until unemployment in the U.S. falls well below six percent. Offshoring went on for decades, but the reshoring trend is only getting started. Feature Stories The Barron's Roundtable offers additional investment bargains in energy, retailing, banking and more in It's Gonna Be Delicious by Lauren R. Rublin. This week's experts include Abby Joseph Cohen, Brian Rogers, Oscar Schafer and Scott Black. Robots in Search of Added Employment by Bill Alpert points out that Intuitive Surgical's (NASDAQ: ISRG) robots have revolutionized surgery for prostate cancer, as well as given the stock a pricey multiple. However, growth could get harder to find. In Rx for Apple: The 4% Solution, Andrew Bary suggests that now that Apple is no longer a high-growth company, it may be time for it to stop hoarding cash. A big share buyback might help the tech giant's faltering stock, but the strongest medicine would be a fatter dividend yield. Jonathan R. Laing's The Show's Just Gettin' Started at Ryman points out that Ryman Hospitality Properties (NYSE: RHP), owner of the Grand Ole Opry and other country-music assets, has become a REIT, with more than 90 percent of its revenue coming from four giant hotel resorts. Value manager Robert Sanborn of the Elkhorn Fund is profiled in Sarah Max's article Ready for the Reckoning. Sanborn says he is prepared for the worst, and shares why he is short Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and long PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP). Nailing the Answers in Our Contest by Andrew Bary features Michael Danaher, the handyman from the Chicago area who topped nearly 2,400 entrants to win the Barron's 2012 forecasting challenge. Jonathan Buck's The Watchwords in Davos: 'Structural Reform' says World Economic Forum attendees see the need for economic changes along with more stimulus programs. A possible United Kingdom pullout from the European Union is among the latest worries. In David Englander's Dole's Sweet Outlook, the stage could be set for a special dividend or share buybacks following a recent deal between Dole Food (NYSE: DOLE) and Japan's Itochu. The article says the future could be bright for Dole shareholders. The CEO spotlight is turned on Doug Yearley in The Master Builder by Leslie P. Norton. The former corporate litigator and home-improvement maven helped build Toll Brothers (NYSE: TOL) into the nation's largest developer of luxury homes. In The Little Brokerage That Could by Vito J. Racanelli, McAdams Wright Ragen again turns in a stellar showing in the Barron's-Zacks semiannual stock-picking contest. The Seattle-based firm has only five analysts. Details Still to Come is an editorial commentary by Thomas G. Donlan in which he points out that the pace of innovation is uneven, but it is accelerating. Columns Columns in this weekend's Barron's discuss: The market as an investment guide Whether investor optimism has lifted the Dow Jones industrials too high Expectations that the new SEC head will get tough on Wall Street Whether Apple's glory days over Web services that put modern portfolio theory into practice for investors The unloved commodity ETFs Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and other dividend boosts Complaints about the pace of government downsizing"
2013-03-07,What's the Deal with Steel?,"Is steel a steal? If prices for the metal really are at a near-term bottom, then now might be a good time to consider adding some cold, hard steel to your portfolio. Longbow Research showed an interest in the sector on Wednesday and initiated coverage on four names in the steel space and upgraded another. If you’re into that sort of thing, there are plenty of articles that will take you through the fundamentals. Basically, if you’re looking for companies with a lot of debt, less than impressive margins and P/E’s so high that you scratch your head and ask why, you’re in the right place. But maybe these names look better from a technical perspective. Let’s see what the charts say about a few of the names that Longbow now has their eye on: First up is Nucor (NYSE: NUE). It’s one of Longbow’s favorites. They initiated coverage with a “Buy” rating. At the beginning of December, Nucor started an impressive move to the upside—nearly 20 percent. This caused a break out through the upper trend line of the ascending channel only to sell off modestly soon after. Then came a retest that formed a double top. The stock failed and sold off to the tune of 9 percent. The stock has since recovered, breaking through its 50 DMA on Wednesday. The stock looks ready to retest the $48.23 top. How about Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD)? If you bought this name back in June when it underperformed the S&P by as much as 25 percent, you’re feeling good about your stock picking abilities right now. It’s up 48 percent since its bottom and recently, a buying opportunity presented itself. Sell volume dried up causing the stock to shed 12 percent while still holding the lower trend line of the ascending channel. It’s currently testing the 20 DMA but the selloff might entice new buying interest if the broader market remains risk-off. Finally, the name that gets the most press in the steel space, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X). If you’re a volatility trader, look no further. Wild price moves aside, the name has only barely formed an ascending channel over the past six months—a red flag in a market that won’t do anything but keep rising. After a large gap higher at the beginning of the year, the stock plunged, breaking through its lower trend line in February. For now, this is a broken stock. U.S. Steel is below its 20, 50, and 200 moving averages and in a three month downtrend with sell volume showing no signs of drying up. Its next chance of gaining some momentum comes at the 200 DMA at $21.39 and then a test of the lower trend line right around $22."

2013-04-03,Big Problems For Steel ETF ,"Signs just keep on creeping up that the materials sector is in trouble and in today's episode of As Materials ETFs Tumble, the Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) is in the spotlight. On light volume, SLX is down 0.7 percent and while that may not sound like much, Wednesday's decline extends a woeful start to 2013 for SLX and the ETF is now flirting with a year-to-date loss of 18 percent. To put that performance into context, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), the worst-performing of the nine sector SPDRs in the first quarter, is still clinging to a year-to-date gain. SLX's problems are not hard to identify. Just start with the ETF's two largest holdings, Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) and Vale (NYSE: VALE). Those mining giants combine for over 26 percent of SLX's weight. Rio Tinto's U.S.-listed shares are off almost 24 percent year-to-date and things could get worse before they get better for the Australian mining giant. Not only are Australian exporters being crimped by a strong Australian dollar, but the central bank there expects the mining sector will peak later this year. The Reserve Bank of Australia has already noted that sectors beyond mining and materials must step up to help the world's 12th-largest economy. Then there is Brazil's Vale, the world's largest iron ore producer. Even with today's 2.4 percent pop, Vale's U.S. shares are off 20.5 percent this year. In the case of this stock, investors can debate what is worse: The company's status as the world's leading iron ore maker or the fact that Vale is a Brazilian firm. Brazil has given investors almost nothing to cheer about for over a year now and Vale is proving to be a drag on SLX and some other marquee ETFs as a result. Investors should not just pick on SLX's foreign holdings. In the past month, Nucor (NYSE: NUE) is off more than three percent. When accounting for the Wednesday plunges of more than three percent in both Allegheny Technologies (NYSE: ATI) and Timken (NYSE: TKR), those stocks are both in the red in the past month. Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) is now about 3.7 percent over the same time. Those four stocks combine for 17.5 percent of the ETF's weight. The hits just keep on coming to SLX. Even before today, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) was down 12 percent since early March. That stock is now flirting with levels not seen since March 2009. SLX also has the misfortune of being home to Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF), the shares of which have plunged more than 52 percent in the past 90 days. Cliffs and U.S. Steel combine for about 6.8 percent of SLX's weight. Thus far in this piece, approximately half of SLX's weight has been accounted for and none of the news is good. Since it an equity-based ETF is moved by its underlying holdings, it is not surprising to see that SLX's technical situation is rapidly worsening. It appears the ETF is heading for its lowest closing price since late May 2012. Additionally, SLX's ability to defend $40 is vital to any hopes of a rebound because the ETF has not closed below that level in nearly four years. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-10-22,UPDATE: UBS Investment Research Reiterates on Nucor Corporation on Multiple Positive Factors,"In a report published Tuesday, UBS Investment Research analyst Matt Murphy reiterated a Buy rating on Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), and raised the price target from $50.00 to $56.00. In the report, UBS Investment Research noted, “Nucor has a sustained record of high margin and ROE generation, only one annual earnings loss in its history (2009), a healthy balance sheet, and over 40 years of uninterrupted quarterly cash dividends. Nucor invests with a long-term view which means investing consistently during downturns, thereby improving earnings power and leverage to recoveries. We believe Nucor's cost basis will improve with the startup of its second DRI facility and over the long-run from its investments in natural gas. While Nucor maintains a diversified product mix, roughly 65% of its end-demand is tied to construction which has yet to take off following the financial crisis. We rate Nucor a Buy and our $56 price target is based on a 7.5x EV/EBITDA (2015) multiple.” Nucor Corporation closed on Monday at $50.73."

2013-11-22,"Wells Fargo is Cautious on Steel Sector, Downgrades Nucor and U.S. Steel ","In a report published Friday, Wells Fargo analyst Sam Dubinsky downgraded Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X). Wells Fargo downgraded U.S. Steel from Market Perform to Underperform. We believe shares are being rewarded prematurely on cost cutting measures, Dubinsky noted. Nucor was downgraded from Outperform to Market Perform as the stock is valued appropiately. Dubinsky also commented on how steel stocks have performed better due to a big uptick in spot HRC pricing, which is currently close to $680 per ton and up. Pricing has recovered due to supply distribution, as numerous mills had unexpected outages and raw material cost inflation. In addition, ASPs trended higher due to lean channel inventories and a pick-up in end demand. The analyst noted mills are also taking a more aggressive stance on annual contract negotiations for 2014 following several years of offering discounts based on the CRU index. Wells Fargo, he says, is cautious on the steel sector -- as we believe mills are setting themselves up for weaker pricing in 2014 due to import competition. We note that while U.S. sheet pricing is currently up over $20+ per ton versus average quarter-to-date levels, international prices are flat to down as much as $15 per ton (weaker in Europe, more stable in Asia regions). We estimate the sheet import price spread using a basket of Geographies is at $165-215 per ton, which is the highest level we have seen since tracking the data (back to late 2010). Dubinsky estimates sheet pricing could conservatively fall $30-$50 per ton. Wells Fargo valuation range for Nucor is between $50-$55 and $17-$21 for U.S. Steel."

2014-03-19,Nucor Provides Q1 Outlook  - Analyst Blog,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced its guidance for the first quarter of 2014 (ending Apr 5, 2014). The North Carolina-based steel maker envisions earnings for the quarter to be in the band of 30 cents to 35 cents per share, above 26 cents registered a year ago and below 53 cents in the previous quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks are currently expecting earnings of 52 cents a share on average for the quarter. Nucor expects its first quarter results to include inventory-related expenses of $14.5 million (or 3 cents per share). This compares with an inventory charge of $17.4 million and $18 million in fourth-quarter 2013 and first-quarter 2013, respectively. The first quarter earnings also include an expected charge of $9 million or 2 cents per share associated with assets disposal. Nucor stated that its first quarter results have been affected by severe weather conditions, leading to lesser demand and decrease in the availability of railcar weaker seasonal performance of the company's fabricated construction products businesses. Moreover, imports have adversely affected the company's pricing and margins at its bar and sheet mills. Further, Nucor expects modest improvements in the nonresidential construction markets. Nucor released its fourth quarter 2013 results in Jan 2014. The company's adjusted (excluding special items) earnings of 46 cents per share for the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents.

2014-03-21,Steel Output Ticks Up in February as China Gains - Analyst Blog,"Global crude steel production rose narrowly in February following a decline a month ago as gains across Asia, Europe and the Middle East capped declines in North and South America, according to a recent World Steel Association (“WSA”) report. The gain came on the heels of higher production in China – the world's biggest steel producer. The international trade body for the iron and steel industry noted that crude steel production for 65 reporting nations crept up 0.6% year over year in the reported month to 125 million tons (Mt). This compares favorably with a 0.4% fall in January. By regions, steel output moved up across Asia, European Union, Other Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Oceania while falling in North America, South America and the C.I.S. Growth was seen across major Asian producers barring India, the fourth-largest producer. Output from China went up 0.4% year over year to 62.1 Mt in February following a 3.2% decline last month due to sluggish industrial activities ahead of new year holidays. Japan (the second largest producer) saw a 1.4% gain in output to 8.4 Mt. Production in India, however, slipped 3.2% to around 6.3 Mt. South Korea raked in a 6.2% gain to 5.3 Mt. Consolidated production went up 0.6% to 83.7 Mt in Asia. In North America, crude steel production in the U.S. – the third-largest steelmaker – dipped 1.7% to 6.7 Mt. Output in Canada and Mexico fell 9.3% and 1.5%, respectively, to around 1 Mt and 1.4 Mt, respectively. Overall production for the region was down 2.7% to roughly 9.1 Mt. In the Europe Union, production from Germany was up 4.2% to 3.6 Mt. Output rose 16.6% in the UK to 1 Mt while declining 3.9% to 1.2 Mt in France. Italy and Spain saw a 3.6% and 10.2% gain in production, respectively, to 2.2 Mt and 1.2 Mt, respectively. Production from Turkey went up 0.7% to 2.7 Mt. Total output rose 4.7% in the European Union to 13.9 Mt. Output in the Middle East rose 6.9% to 2.2 Mt with gains witnessed across Iran, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Africa recorded a 7.7% gain to 1.2 Mt riding on a 19.3% rise in South Africa. Among other notable producers, production fell 3.1% in Russia to 5.3 Mt while rising 1.2% to 2.6 Mt in Brazil. Ukraine registered a 10.7% decline to 2.3 Mt. Crude steel capacity utilization ratio for the reporting countries was 77.6% in February, down from 79.6% a year ago. The ratio, however, improved from 74.4% in Jan 2014. Steelmakers globally suffered the pangs of challenging steel market fundamentals, European debt predicament and weak pricing for the most part of 2013. Steel prices were hobbled by overcapacity in the industry and weak demand, crimping margins of major producers including ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT), U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and AK Steel (NYSE: AKS). According to the WSA, world crude steel production rose 3.5% year over year to 1,607 Mt in 2013 as gains across Asia, Middle East and Africa more than offset declines in other regions. With the global economic recovery gathering steam and activities picking up in automotive and construction sectors, prospects look healthy for the steel industry in 2014. The WSA sees continued recovery in steel demand and expects global steel usage to increase 3.3% this year factoring in higher contributions from developed economies. Improving demand is also expected to perk up steel prices. A gradually healing economy, strength in the auto sector and a rebound in non-residential construction and housing markets are expected to help pull the U.S. steel industry out of its funk in 2014. Signs of stabilization in steel usage in the Euro zone also look encouraging after a bumpy 2013, which bode well for recovery prospects this year.

2014-04-16,AK Steel Hikes Stainless Steel Prices - Analyst Blog,"AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) will hike prices of commodity sheet and strip, pipe and tube sheet and strip as well as specialty sheet and strip through a discount reduction of 2 percentage points. The company will raise prices of all other stainless steel products, including automotive exhaust sheet and strip by $40 per ton. The price hike for all stainless steel products will be effective with shipments from May 4, 2014. Surcharges will remain applicable on all stainless steel products of AK Steel. Prior to this, on Mar 14, AK Steel had raised prices for all of its stainless steel products, effective with shipments from Apr 1, 2014. Price increases for stainless steel products were achieved through a discount reduction of 2 percentage points and all products using net prices including automotive exhaust products, by adding 2 cents per pound on the existing prices. From the steel industry's perspective, steel prices are generally volatile owing to the highly-cyclical nature of the global steel industry. Rising raw material prices have a direct impact on steel prices. Furthermore, overcapacity, a glut in cheaper Chinese steel imports, economic conditions and shifts toward other substitutes significantly impact steel prices. This was what affected steel prices in 2013. The oversupply of steel due to imports from China in the market outstripped demand. The situation in Europe and tempering growth in Asia added to this and kept prices in check. The lower steel prices affected margins of major steelmakers including ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT), United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X) and Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE) for the major part of the year. A sustained decline in steel prices will materially affect margins of steel companies. However, the recovery in pricing is expected to be driven by a reviving economy, stabilization in the Euro-zone and a rebound in construction activity in the developing countries, particularly in China, India and South Korea. According to the first-quarter 2014 outlook provided by AK Steel, it expects its average selling price to rise roughly 6% to about $1,095 from $1,031 per ton in the fourth quarter of 2013 due to a richer shipment mix of value-added products. Also, the company expects to incur loss in the range of 44 cents to 49 cents per share in the first quarter mainly due to higher energy costs and an unplanned outage at its Ashland Works blast furnace. Due to the outage, AK Steel expects its steel shipments to decline 10–12% sequentially to about 1,250,000 to 1,275,000 tons in the first quarter of 2014. AK Steel is slated to release its first-quarter 2014 results on the Apr 22 before the market opens. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is currently pegged at a loss of 43 cents.

Profit (as reported) came in at $111 million (or 35 cents per share), surging roughly 31% from $84.8 million (or 26 cents per share) posted in the prior-year quarter. First-quarter earnings results, when compared sequentially, were affected by severe weather conditions, leading to lesser demand, decrease in the availability of railcar and a weaker seasonal performance of the company's fabricated construction products businesses. Moreover, imports have adversely affected the company's pricing and margins at its bar and sheet mills. The Quarter in Detail Nucor, which is among the prominent steel producing companies along with ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) and United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X), registered revenues of $5,108.4 million in the quarter, up 12.3% from $4,550.8 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,819 million.

The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the first quarter was $398, up 5% from $379 a year ago. Overall operating rates at Nucor's steel mills were 75%, up 3% compared with the year-ago quarter. Increases in the natural gas and electricity unit costs led to increase the total steel mill energy costs in the first quarter by roughly $5 per ton compared to the first quarter of 2013. The progress of the new direct reduced iron (NYSE: DRI) plant in St. James Parish, LA, continued with 455,000 tons of production with peak operating rates outpacing 90% of the name plate capacity, thus achieving excellent metallization and carbon percentages. Verdict vs. Nucor in Texas Antitrust Case In Mar 2014, a Houston, TX-based jury returned a verdict against Nucor and five other co-defendants in an antitrust lawsuit filed in the Federal District Court in Houston, TX, by complainant MM Steel, LP, a steel plate service center. Per the verdict, all defendants jointly and severally are charged $52 million for damages caused. The amount is subjected to triple under the federal antitrust laws. The amount Nucor has to pay for the damages, if any, is unknown at this point. However, Nucor is pursuing every necessary post-trial motion and appeal to have the verdict overturned. Financial Position Nucor ended the first quarter with $1,252.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with $932.2 million in the year-ago quarter. It also has an unused $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that will mature in Aug 2018. Cash flow from operations was $149.2 million for first-quarter 2014, compared with $128.8 million recorded a year ago. Guidance Nucor expects better performance in the second quarter of 2014 compared with the first quarter (after excluding the impact of tax and disposal of assets expenses incurred). The company anticipates better performance from steel mills and fabricated construction product businesses (rebar fabrication, joist and decking and pre-engineered metal buildings) despite the expected continued pricing and margins pressure at the steel mills segment. Further, Nucor expects modest improvements in the nonresidential construction markets in 2014. Nucor currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Another player in the steel industry worth considering is Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (NYSE: SID), carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2014-05-06,Balanced View on Nucor - Analyst Blog,"On May 1, we issued an updated research report on steel maker Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE). While healthy momentum across automotive and energy markets coupled with the company's key projects should support results moving ahead, weak pricing and challenging steel market fundamentals remain concerns. Nucor, on Apr 24, posted healthy first-quarter 2014 results. Both revenues and adjusted earnings for the quarter topped Zacks Consensus Estimates. Profit climbed year over year on the back of higher shipments. Nucor expects improved earnings on a sequential basis in the second quarter. The company anticipates better performance from steel mills and fabricated construction product businesses despite the expected pricing and margins pressure at its Steel Mills segment. Nucor, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, is seeing strength across end markets such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and general manufacturing. Demand across these end-markets is healthy, lending support to the company's top line. Moreover, Nucor is progressing well with its key projects that are expected to boost its earnings power over the long-term. The Louisiana direct reduced iron (NYSE: DRI) facility, its largest project, came online in Dec 2013. The $750 million plant is expected to produce 2.5 million tons of DRI annually when the operations are in full swing. The facility achieved peak operating rate of above 90% during the first quarter. Nucor is also aggressively investing to secure a low-cost supply of natural gas on a long-term basis to cover its expected future steelmaking and DRI production needs. The company also has an impressive record of returning cash to shareholders. However, the steel industry is still going through a difficult phase and market fundamentals remains challenging in the U.S. There is not enough demand for steel products due to persistent weakness in construction end markets, resulting in excess supply. Contributing toward this inventory glut are production ramp-ups by domestic steel producers and rapid growth in Chinese production. Nucor, like other steel makers, is hobbled by surging domestic steel imports. Consumers in the U.S. are importing cheaper steel from China, forcing domestic steel producers to sell at lower prices. Despite the U.S. steel industry's low capacity utilization, imports continue to flow into the domestic market due to foreign producers' overcapacity. Imported steel share of the domestic market increased to as much as 36% during the first quarter. Other Stocks to Consider Other companies in the steel and related industry with favorable Zacks Rank include NN Inc. (NASDAQ: NNBR), CIRCOR International, Inc. (NYSE: CIR) and Precision Castparts Corp. (NYSE: PCP). While NN carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both CIRCOR and Precision Castparts hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2014-05-22,"Steel Output Rises on China Gains, EU Recovery - Analyst Blog","Global crude steel production rose for a third straight month in April on higher output from China – the world's biggest steel producer – according to a World Steel Association (“WSA”) report. Gains in the European Union, thanks to a recovery in steel demand in the region, coupled with a strong rise in the Middle East also contributed to the growth. The international trade body for the iron and steel industry said that crude steel production for 65 reporting nations went up 1.7% year over year in the reported month to 137 million tons (Mt). This follows a 2.7% gain last month and a 0.6% rise in February. By regions, production data paints a mixed picture with Asia, European Union, North America and Middle East recording gains while Other Europe, South America, the C.I.S., Africa and Oceania registering a decline in output. All major Asian producers racked up gains barring Japan – the second largest producer. Output from China rose 2.1% year over year to 68.8 Mt in April. Japan saw a 2.5% fall in production to 8.9 Mt as a recent increase in sales tax by the government hurt demand in that country. Production in India, the fourth-largest producer, rose 5.3% to around 7 Mt. South Korea logged a healthy 10.8% gain to 6.1 Mt. Consolidated production rose 2.2% to 92.8 Mt in Asia. In North America, steel production in the U.S. – the third-largest steelmaker – edged down 1.6% to 7 Mt. Output in Canada and Mexico, however, rose 2% and 12.1%, respectively, to around 1 Mt and 1.6 Mt, respectively. Overall production for the region inched up 0.7% to roughly 9.7 Mt. In the Europe Union, production from Germany – the largest producer in the region – moved up 3.9% to 3.7 Mt. Output fell 4% in Italy to 2 Mt while climbing 16% to 1.4 Mt in France. Spain saw a 3.1% decline to 1.2 Mt. Production rose 13.5% in the UK to about 1.1 Mt. Total output rose 4% in the European Union to 14.6 Mt. Output in the Middle East climbed 9.6% to 2.3 Mt with gains witnessed across all steel producing countries. Africa recorded a 2.5% decline to 1.3 Mt with a 2.4% fall in South Africa. Among other notable producers, production from Turkey slipped 9.1% to 2.6 Mt. Russia, which is battered by its ongoing conflict with Ukraine, saw a mere 0.7% rise to 5.8 Mt while Ukraine registered a 4.5% decline to 2.6 Mt. Output from Brazil, the largest producer in South America, clipped 5.1% to 2.8 Mt. Crude steel capacity utilization ratio for the reporting countries was 78.7% in Apr 2014, down from 79.9% a year ago and 79% in the previous month. Steelmakers globally suffered the pangs of challenging steel market fundamentals, debt crisis in Europe and weak pricing for the most part of 2013. Overcapacity in the industry, a glut in cheaper imports and weak demand hammered steel prices during the year, hurting margins of major producers including ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT), U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and AK Steel (NYSE: AKS). According to the WSA, world crude steel production rose 3.5% year over year to 1,607 Mt in 2013 as gains across Asia, Middle East and Africa more than offset declines in other regions. China alone contributed nearly half of the global output. With the global economic recovery gathering steam and activities picking up in the construction sector, prospects look healthy for the steel industry in 2014. The WSA sees continued recovery in steel demand and expects global steel usage to increase 3.1% this year and further rise 3.3% in 2015. However, the industry faces challenges in form of an expected deceleration in steel usage in China and sluggishness in emerging economies due to certain structural issues. A gradually healing economy, strength in the auto sector and a rebound in non-residential construction and housing markets are expected to help pull the U.S. steel industry out of its funk in 2014. Moreover, an expected rise in steel usage in the Euro-zone looks encouraging after a lumpy 2013, which augur well for recovery prospects this year. Improving demand, driven by healthy momentum in the automotive market, is also expected to jack up steel prices. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2014-06-17,Morgan Stanley Suggests Pair Trade For Steel Earnings,"Morgan Stanley sees a second quarter beat for Nucor (NYSE: NUE) and miss for AK Steel (NYSE: AKS), according to a research report published Tuesday. Morgan Stanley boosted its EPS estimate for Nucor by more than 29 percent from $0.58 to $0.75. The analyst consensus is $0.61. Commenting on the change, analyst Evan Kurtz writes, “We believe Nucor has been able to take advantage of year-to-date competitor outages by taking market share. We expect the Steel Products business to show substantially improved profitability as weather impact eases and construction activity picks up.” On the other hand, Kurtz does not expect a strong quarter from AK Steel; EPS estimates were cut from $0.08 to a $0.03 loss. The analyst consensus is currently $0.10. Kurtz writes, “We expect 2Q14 earnings to mark a trough for the year, but are also below consensus in 3Q14 as the timing of outage costs may spill over into the next quarter. However, the company should benefit from falling iron ore costs over the course of the year and some investors may look to buy a miss.” Both Nucor and AK Steel are up very low volume Tuesday, to $50.39 and $6.84."
2014-06-20,"Steel Sector May Post Higher Costs, Flat Prices In Q2","After the market close on Thursday, AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) announced its 2014 second quarter financial guidance. By the looks of it, the steel sector may have suffered from margin pressure during the quarter. In the release, AK Steel noted that, due to harsh weather conditions in the first quarter that caused delayed shipments of Canadian iron ore, production was slowed to match supply. In addition to the reduced ore supply, AK was subject to higher transportation costs to the tune of ~$15 million or $0.11 pre-tax diluted EPS. In support of the claim that the sector is facing pressure in the second quarter, Nucor (NYSE: NUE) has just released its own guidance for the second quarter at the low end of its previously issued expectations. The company stated, Import levels continue to negatively impact pricing and margins, particularly at our bar and sheet mills, adding, Steel demand continues to be strong, particularly for sheet and plate products. Following the release of their respective guidance, shares of AK and Nucor are both down ~1.95 percent in Friday's session. Highlights from both AK and Nucor's guidance are listed below. AK Steel Net loss of $0.19 to $0.23 per diluted common share; adjusted net loss of $0.02 to $0.06 per diluted common share. Shipments of approximately 1,375,000 tons, an approximate nine percent increase from the prior quarter. Flat average selling price compared to prior quarter. Market-to-market loss on its derivatives of approximately $23 million, or pre-tax $0.17 per diluted share. Nucor Second quarter results to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.40 per diluted share. Included in the projected second quarter of 2014 results is approximately $21 million ($0.04 per diluted share) of additional employee stock-based compensation expense.

2014-06-24,Nucor Issues Q2 Earnings View - Analyst Blog,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) expects higher profit on an year over year basis in second-quarter 2014 (ending Jul 5, 2014). But it sees earnings to come at the bottom end of its expectations that supported its qualitative guidance issued in April. The NC-based steel maker envisions earnings for the second quarter in the band of 35 cents to 40 cents per share, higher than 27 cents logged a year ago. The projected results are comparable with 35 cents recorded in first-quarter 2014. Nucor, in its first-quarter 2014 earnings call, said that it expects improved earnings on a sequential basis in the second quarter. Nucor's shares slipped roughly 2.2% last Friday to close at $50.52. For its Raw Materials division, Nucor expects an operating loss of $30 million or 6 cents per share at its new direct reduced iron (NYSE: DRI) plant in Louisiana due to high product yield losses. A planned three-week outage has been initiated at the plant this month to make some process adjustments to cut yield losses. The company sees meaningful improvement in the performance of the DRI facility in the third quarter and expects profitability in late 2014. The DRI facility, Nucor's largest project, came online in Dec 2013. The $750 million plant is expected to produce 2.5 million tons of DRI annually when the operations are in full swing. Nucor expects results at its Steel Mills segment to improve modestly on a sequential basis in the second quarter as improved profitability in sheet and plate more than offset reduced profitability in the structural steel business. A planned outage related to the sheet piling capital project is expected to lead to lower shipments for structural steel in the quarter. Moreover, higher imports continue to impact pricing and margins. Following a weaker seasonal performance in the first quarter, Nucor's fabricated construction products businesses returned to profitability in the second quarter, helped by improving conditions in the non-residential construction market. The company sees higher operating profits from these businesses moving ahead. Nucor is seeing strength across end markets such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and general manufacturing. Demand across these end-markets is healthy, lending support to the company's top line. However, Nucor remains exposed to weak pricing and challenging steel market fundamentals. The company, like other steel makers, is hobbled by surging domestic steel imports. Nucor currently retains a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some other stocks worth considering in the steel space include Universal Stainless & Alloy Products Inc. (NASDAQ: USAP), Grupo Simec S.A.B. de C.V.(AMEX:SIM) and ThyssenKrupp AG (TYEKF).

2014-07-24,"Nucor (NUE) Beats Earnings in Q2, Forecasts Stronger Q3  ","Steel giant Nucor Corporation's (NYSE: NUE) second-quarter 2014 profit came in at $147 million (or 46 cents per share), surging roughly 73% from $85.1 million (or 27 cents per share) posted in the prior-year quarter. Earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents. The improved second-quarter earnings results, when compared sequentially, were driven by improved performance by the steel mills segment, particularly at the sheet and bar mills. The Quarter in Detail Nucor registered revenues of $5,291 million in the quarter, up 13.4% from $4,665.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,181 million. The company's sheet steel and bar mills profitability increased due to higher sales volumes and margin improvement. However, structural steel experienced decreased volumes as Nucor-Yamato Steel underwent a planned three week outage in the second quarter. Nucor's fabricated construction products businesses returned to solid profitability in the quarter, due to improving conditions in the nonresidential construction markets. Results from the raw materials segment decreased in the second quarter compared with the sequentially prior quarter as the company's new direct reduced iron (NYSE: DRI) plant in St. James Parish, LA, underwent a three week outage to implement adjustments that is expected to improve yield and conversion costs. However, the plant produced outstanding quality DRI units and also exceeded the company's volume expectations. Lower scrap selling prices also led to decreased profitability in the raw materials segment when compared with the sequentially prior quarter. Average sales price per ton increased 4% from the year-ago quarter. Total tons shipped to outside customers rose 9% year over year to 6,370,000 tons in the reported quarter and total mill shipments increased 9% to 5,477,000 tons. The average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used in the second quarter was $384, up 2% from $377 a year ago. Overall operating rates at Nucor's steel mills were 79%, up from 73% in the year-ago quarter. Total steel mill energy costs in the reported quarter increased by $1 per ton year over year. Financial Position Nucor ended the second quarter with $1,167.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments compared with $678.12 million in the year-ago quarter. Long-term debt was $4,368.9 million at the end of the quarter versus $3,380.2 million a year ago. It also has an unused $1.5 billion revolving credit facility that will mature in Aug 2018. Guidance Nucor expects strong earnings improvement in the third quarter of 2014. The company stated that non-residential construction market is improving at a modest pace, despite being historically low levels. The company anticipates further increased operating profits in its downstream products businesses. In the third quarter, steel mill profitability is also expected to improve as Nucor-Yamato Steel division has no planned outage and sheet and plate margins continue to benefit from positive pricing trends. Further, Nucor forecasts Louisiana DRI facility to demonstrate improvement in the performance in the third quarter with profitable performance anticipated by the end of the year. Nucor currently retains a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some other stocks worth considering in the steel and related industries include NN Inc. (NASDAQ: NNBR), Olympic Steel Inc.

2014-08-04,KeyBanc: M&A And Potential Trade Cases Strengthen Certain Steel Companies,"According to analysts at KeyBanc, there exists a solid stream of macro-economic and other data sects which indicates there exists a demand recovery in the steel market. This bodes well for the risk-reward characteristics in shares of United States Steel (NYSE: X) and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) The analysts, Philip Gibbs and Tyler Kenyon, point out that stable auto sales data, PMI, ABI and rig count all confirm the steel industry is on track to achieve a three percent to five percent consumption growth rate by the end of 2014. M&A Potential And Trade Cases According to the analysts, investors could expect further consolidation in M&A activity over near-term. In addition, the notion of “leveling the playing field” through trade restrictions is becoming more likely. “We expect a series of trade cases to be filed over the next six to twelve months, targeted at carbon sheet and plate products arenas,” the analysts wrote. “While trade case fillings may not ultimately stifle the volumes of steel coming into the United States, we believe, at a minimum, this will help solidify the pricing floor across sheet and plate products.” The analysts note that M&A activity and trade cases may “defray” some investor concerns related to industry pricing power and the higher domestic steel prices compared to foreign competitors. The analysts are raising their 2014 and 2015 sheet pricing assumptions based on a tighter U.S. supply-demand balance. The analysts are projecting a cost of $669 per ton for U.S. Hot Rolled Coil in 2014 which will slightly decline to $645 per ton in 2015, which is in-line with the current NYMEX futures curve. United States Steel: 45 Percent Upside Gibbs and Kenyon established a $48 price target on shares of United States Steel, representing over 45 percent upside from current share prices. At the same time, the analysts upgraded shares from Hold to Buy. The analysts previously held bearish views based on an OCTG trade case ruling in mid-February. Additionally, an “escalating malaise” in the commodities environment existed along with a general concern that an iron ore pricing correction has the potential to drive U.S. sheet pricing lower. These negative sentiments have abated in recent months given a more positive OCTG trade case final determination and a perception that the iron ore correct has run its course. Looking forward, the analysts express a bullish sentiment that exceeds the Street's current expectation. The reasons include the potential for further productivity savings announcements, growth initiatives and potential higher interest rates that could create additional positive catalysts. The analysts are expecting United States Steel to report a third quarter earnings per share estimate of $1.19, noticeably higher than the Street's estimate of $0.73. In fiscal 2015 the analysts are projecting a full year earnings per share of $4.00, also noticeably higher than the Street's estimate of $2.29. Steel Dynamics: 30 Percent Upside Gibbs and Kenyon established a $28 price target on shares of Steel Dynamics, representing over 30 percent upside from current share prices. At the same time, the analysts upgraded shares from Hold to Buy. The analysts believe that Steel Dynamics offer investors an under-appreciated story given the likelihood of “upside surprises” from its acquisition of Severstal's Columbus facility. In addition, investors are perhaps also under-appreciating Steel Dynamic's improving sheet metal spreads, operational progress at Mesabi Nugget and a “sizable” pro forma free cash flow in 2015 of over $600. Other Notable Ratings Gibbs and Kenyon maintained a Hold rating on AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) with no assigned price target. Gibbs and Kenyon maintained a Buy rating on Nucor (NYSE: NUE) with an unchanged $58 price target."

2014-09-04,Nucor's (NUE) Shares Touch Fresh 52-Week High at $55.26  ,"Shares of Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) hit a new 52-week high of $55.26 on Sep 3 and eventually closed at $55.02. Nucor has delivered a one-year return of about 24% and year-to-date return of 4.6%. Average volume of shares traded over the last three months was roughly 1,565K. What's Driving Nucor Up? Nucor, on Jul 24, posted healthy second-quarter 2014 results. Both revenues and earnings for the quarter topped Zacks Consensus Estimate. Profit was driven by improved performance of the company's steel mills business. Nucor expects improved earnings on a sequential basis in the third quarter. Moreover, the company anticipates higher operating profits in its downstream products businesses in the quarter. Nucor is progressing well with its key projects that are expected to boost its earnings over the long-term. The Louisiana direct reduced iron (NYSE: DRI) facility, its largest project, came online in Dec 2013. The $750 million plant is expected to produce 2.5 million tons of DRI annually when operations are in full swing. In addition, the Nucor-Yamato structural mill recently completed a roughly $115 million project, offering expanded sheet piling production capabilities. Nucor is also aggressively investing to secure a low-cost supply of natural gas on a long-term basis to cover its expected future steelmaking and DRI production needs. Expanded DRI capacity combined with the company's natural gas investments will enable it to grow in sheet and SBQ (special bar quality) markets.https Moreover, Nucor is seeing strength across end markets such as automotive, energy, heavy equipment and general manufacturing. Demand across these end-markets is healthy, lending support to the company's top line. However, the steel industry is still going through a difficult phase and market fundamentals remain challenging in the U.S. While non-residential construction activities are improving, the market remains much below its peak levels. Nucor currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other Stocks to Consider Other companies in the steel industry with favorable Zacks Rank include Grupo Simec S.A.B. de C.V. (AMEX:SIM), TimkenSteel Corporation (NYSE: TMST) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS). While Grupo Simec and TimkenSteel sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), AK Steel carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2014-10-31,Cliffs Natural Resources Closer To Locating Partners For Quebec Mine,"Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF) may be getting close to obtaining partners for a troubled Bloom Lake iron mine in Quebec. Chief Executive Lourenco C. Goncalves told investors earlier this week the company is in active discussions with three unnamed potential partners that would help with the roughly $1.95 billion required to double operations there and restart its profits. Dow Jones reported Friday that Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and two Japanese steel companies it didn't name are the potential partners. Cliffs jumped 9 percent Friday, trading recently at $11.46 per share. Goncalves said that together with existing partner Wuhan Iron Ore & Steel Co., the four minority equity holders would absorb the entire production of the Bloom Lake mine. We have a goal of securing commitments before the end of 2014, Gonclaves said, adding that without the equity infusion, Cliffs would close the operation. With the cash infusion in place, Goncalves said the mine would produce 13.5 million tons of high quality iron ore at a relatively low cost. This would be truly outstanding. And with this cost profile and equity fusion, we would surely want to continue to want and operate that, Goncalves said. The company continues with plans to sell iron mines in Australia along with its Applachia coal mines and focus on five iron mines in Michigan and Minnesota. Cliffs announced a $6 billion write-down October 17 for the impairment of assets that included the Bloom Lake mine."

2014-11-18,U.S. Steel Realigns Operating Units To Meet Strategic Goals,"United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X) has reached another important step in its Carnegie Way program. It is realigning its three business segments – North American Flat-Rolled, Tubular and U.S. Steel Europe – to attain three strategic goals. These are to increase collaboration with customers, focus on the Carnegie Way projects within the operating units with reliable maintenance and quality, and proper safety, and to create more focused and effective accountability. According to the president and CEO of U.S. Steel, Mario Longhi, this realignment will help the company to create a closer bond with its customers by catering to their market demands, thus strengthening its position globally. The North American Flat-Rolled segment will be realigned with the creation of commercial entities to address five markets – automotive, consumer, industrial, service centers and mining. Each entity will be headed by a business leader for delivering better customer solutions. Automotive Solutions will be located in the U.S. Steel's Automotive Center in Troy, MI. The company works jointly with its consumers at the facility, using the advanced high-strength steels (“AHSS”) to address the fuel economy standards and safety demands of the industry. Consumer Solutions, on the other hand, will address consumers in the appliance, packaging, container and construction markets. Additional product lines within the unit include COR-TEN AZP, ACRYLUME, GALVALUME and Weathered Metals. The Industrial Solutions will cater to the company's customers in the pipe and tube manufacturing markets, and the agricultural and industrial equipment markets. Service Center Solutions will work with service center and distributor customers. Mining Solutions will look after the operations of the company's Minnesota Ore Operations facilities – Minntac in Mt. Iron and Keetac in Keewatin – as well as its iron ore equity joint ventures. Moreover, the company will stress on implementing strategic initiatives with reliable maintenance and quality, and proper safety measures under the Flat-Rolled manufacturing operations. U.S. Steel Tubular Products' commercial and manufacturing operations, now known as Energy Solutions, will also be realigned to include customer solutions for the oil and gas industry. The unit will be based in Houston, and focus on the development of the company's tubular operations as well as the U. S. Steel Tubular Products Innovation and Technology Center. U.S. Steel Europe will be renamed U. S. Steel European Solutions and is currently being aligned through the Carnegie Way transformation to increase focus on their customers. U.S. Steel will continue to have the previous three reportable operating segments and remain unaffected with the new management structure and commercial entities. The company will conduct an extensive search for the business leaders required for each entity. U.S. Steel currently holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong buy).

2014-11-25,What Makes Olympic Steel A Strong Sell?,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio. One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Olympic Steel Inc. (NASDAQ: ZEUS), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in ZEUS. A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 3 estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.09 a share a month ago to its current level of 73 cents. Also, for the current quarter, Olympic Steel has seen 2 downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 2 cents a share from 20 cents over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 10.1% in the past month. So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait. If you are still interested in the Steel-Producers sector, you may instead consider some better-ranked stocks including Kobe Steel Ltd. (KBSTY), Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X). All these stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and may be better selections at this time.

2014-12-10,"POSCO (PKX) Poised for Solid Growth, Runs Near-Term Risks","We issued an updated research report on South Korean steel producer POSCO (NYSE: PKX) on Dec 9, 2014. On the basis of output, the company is one of the largest steel producers in the world, having produced roughly 38.3 million tons of crude steel in 2013. With a well diversified portfolio and international presence, POSCO is working diligently to enhance its steel-production capabilities and consequently, benefit from the growing steel demand worldwide. The company prefers to increase value-added products like cold-rolled steel, automotive steel plates and electric steel sheets in its portfolio. In Jan 2014, POSCO received a green signal for its $12 billion steel plant project in Orissa; while in the second quarter, the company expanded production at the Myanmar gas field and enlarged its coal-fired power business by acquiring Tong Yang Power. Also, the company completed the construction of its fourth hot rolling-steel plant in November and started construction of the Thailand-based automotive steel sheet-producing facility in October. For fourth-quarter 2014, POSCO anticipates a slight sequential increase in steel demand on the back of favorable seasonal impacts and growing steel demand from the automobile industry. Also, the company revised its consolidated revenue projection for 2014 upward to KRW 65.5 trillion from KRW 64.5 trillion. Despite solid long-term growth prospects as well as sound expectations for 2014, the presence of headwinds cannot be ruled out completely. Rising costs and expenses as well as growing competitive threats can prove to be a major deterrent to POSCO's growth. In third-quarter 2014, the company's earnings were adversely affected by a 6% increase in cost of sales as well as a 7% hike in selling and administrative expenses. POSCO currently has a market capitalization of roughly $21.3 billion. It competes with other industry-players including Kobe Steel Ltd. (KBSTY), Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and United States Steel Corp. (NYSE: X). While Kobe Steel sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Nucor Corporation and United States Steel hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2015-01-15,"Barclays Is Bullish On Steel Producers, Neutral On Copper Miners And Cautious On Coal Companies","Matthew Korn of Barclays on Thursday commented that concerns on global growth and persistently weak commodity prices remain an overhang among the metals and mining group. Korn is bullish on steel producers given the producers exposure to an improving American steel demand that should offset the downward trend in steel pricing. The analyst favors Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) as they both stand to gain from steel consumption growth from construction, manufacturing and automotive industries. In addition, both companies have major projects that are expected to reach critical mass in 2015 that could drive greater raw material self-sufficiency, lower costs and improved cash flows. Korn is Neutral on copper miners as the bullish impact of lower-than-expected metal supply will outweigh a slowdown in Chinese consumption growth, pushing copper prices higher. The analyst adds that Southern Copper Corp (NYSE: SCCO) offers a more favorable risk profile compared to Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX), whose stock remains pressured by uncertainty around its Indonesian operations. Finally, Korn is cautious on coal companies as low natural gas prices along with growing utility regulations, and a slowing Chinese demand for imported coal will hurt demand. The analyst states that “there is really not much these companies can do” except hope for a price upturn. Nevertheless, Cloud Peak Energy Inc (NYSE: CLD) offers a “relatively healthy” balance sheet, a steady thermal-only PRB market and reasonable valuation on realistic pricing."

2015-01-16,Barclays Bullish On Steel (And Mini-Mill Companies),"In a report published Thursday, Barclays weighed in on U.S. metals and mining, and expressed its bullishness on the steel, even in spite of concerns on global growth and persistently weak commodity prices. Analysts Matthew J. Korn and Kalpesh Patel said they believe that the effects of the downward trend in steel pricing will be offset by the steel mini-mill companies' exposure to increasing American steel demand. The research firm believes that its Overweight-rated steel stocks, Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), stand to gain from steel consumption growth from the U.S. construction, manufacturing, and automotive industries, (…) while offering little direct exposure to the suddenly troubled energy sector. Barclays initiated coverage on both Steel Dynamics and Nucor as Overweight cases, with respective price targets of $30 and $62. This implies an upside potential of approximately 74 percent for the former, and 40 percent for the latter. In addition, both companies expect to see major projects to reach critical mass in 2015. This should drive greater raw material self-sufficiency, lower costs, and improved cash flows."

In the report, Nomura noted, “We continue to see NUE's earnings mix in the coming years benefitting from accelerating non-res construction markets, a higher contribution of value added products, and raw materials cost (DRI) tailwinds. While Nucor's 1Q-15 guidance of only marginal improvement vs. 1Q-14 implies significant q/q downside, management expects lower scrap values set to materialize in February (market expects a $30-40/ton m/m decline) to result in meaningful metal margin relief starting 2Q- 15. The Louisiana DRI plant won't be operational until late in 1Q-15, resulting in similar losses as 4Q ($35mm) this quarter. After incurring losses of $135mm in 2014, NUE expects the operation to improve through the year, becoming profitable by year-end. We estimate that, at $65/t iron ore and $3.00/mmBtu gas prices, DRI would drive ~$0.60 of EPS at current pig iron prices.” Nucor closed on Wednesday at $44.04."

2015-03-19,Nucor Complains About Imports; Steel Sector Sells Off,"Steel makers' shares fell broadly Thursday after Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) said higher imports of cheaply priced Chinese imported steel will result in lower-than-expected first quarter profits. Pittsburgh-based Nucor is the world's 14th-largest steel maker, just behind United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X). The exceptionally high level of imports flooding the domestic market will result in lower prices and narrower margins, Nucor said. U.S. Steel last week cited a high level of imports and unfairly traded products in a plan to temporarily idle its Minnesota ore operations effective May 13. The steel-sector sell-off gave back gains from a rally Wednesday, perhaps touched off from an outlook offered by the much smaller Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD). Steel Dynamics said imports will decline in the second half of 2015 as domestic steel prices fall to a competitive level. The company predicted improving profits as a result.

(NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE) which made similar announcements this week. Each blamed falling steel prices caused by an influx of cheap imports from China, but Wells Fargo's Sam Dubinsky said prices have hit bottom. Dubinsky rates all three steel makers at Market Perform, but said Nucor and Steel Dynamics will see wider profit margins starting in the second half of 2015. Citing its valuation, Dubinsky called Steel Dynamics a better value for investors who want to time the firming up of fundamentals in the steel industry, relative to Nucor. Although prices may be on the cusp of stabilization, Dubinsky doesn't see them rising substantially. That's problematic for high-cost producers, Dubinsky said. AK Steel doesn't have many levers to generate profits outside of a price recovery. Lower costs for iron ore, scrap, and coal should help modestly, but not enough in our view for AK's turnaround, Dubinsky said. Steel imports should subside in coming months as prices for domestically made product have fallen to competitive levels, Dubinsky said. A number of U.S. steel makers have recently spoken of unfair trade practices by China, and a complaint to the International Trade Commission may be in the offing."

Wall Street expected earnings of $0.01 cent a share. Automotive demand will remain strong and lower costs for scrap and iron ore will help results, but this will be significantly outweighed by selling-price declines, the company said. Both Nucor Corp.

Chinese imports have caused lower-than-expected steel prices, which will result in a first-quarter net loss between $0.23 and $0.28 a share, AK said. Wall Street expected earnings of $0.01 a share. Automotive demand will remain strong and lower costs for scrap and iron ore will help results, but this will be significantly outweighed by selling-price declines, the company said. Both Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) made similar comments about imported steel in outlooks this week. U.S. steelmakers plan to meet with the Congressional Steel Caucus later this month, according to The Wall Street Journal. The congressional meeting may be a prelude to an anti-dumping complaint to the International Trade Commission, which could impose tariffs if the products are found to be unfairly subsidized."
2015-03-20,CNBC's Stock Pops & Drops From March 19,"On CNBC's Stock Pops & Drops, Brian Kelly said that China Mobile Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE: CHL) is a bet on China and since China is slowing he doesn't want to buy the stock. China Mobile dropped 4.23 percent and Kelly doesn't see a buying opportunity. He would stay away from the stock. Jon Najarian explained that Guess?, Inc. (NYSE: GES) traded 16.01 percent higher because Old Navy was off the charts. He added that a big short interest had some impact, too. Karen Finerman sees more room on the downside in Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. (NYSE: CFR). She wouldn't buy the stock. Guy Adami thinks that Nucor Corporation's (NYSE: NUE) guidance was a disaster. The stock fell 6.43 percent to $46.10 and it seems to Adami that it is going to $42."

2015-04-14,"Analyst Sees Steel-Dumping Case On Horizon, Launches Sector Coverage","U.S. steel producers are likely to file dumping charges against China following the release of their first-quarter results, an analyst said Monday. But it's often a regulatory 'whack-a-mole' game, Clarkson Capital's Lee McMillan said. Cheap steel is notoriously difficult to keep out of the country. Despite his expectation of continued low steel prices, McMillan launched coverage on eight steel makers Monday with no less than four Buy ratings. Key to picking winners: exposure to the U.S. automotive and construction industries. Citing those factors, McMillan offered Buy recommendations on ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE: MT), AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) Nucor Corp. (NYSE: NUE) and Tata Steel Ltd. Steel makers that rely on the oil and gas industry, which typically accounts for 10 percent of U.S. steel demand, are likely to be in a rut for awhile, McMillan said. Rating a Sell: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) for its high fixed costs and reliance on the U.S. energy sector. McMillan is on the fence mostly over valuation with Hold ratings on Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC), Reliance Steel & Aluminum (NYSE: RS) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD). With Chinese Steel consumption down more than 7 percent in the first two months of 2015, McMillan said imports will continue to depress U.S. steel prices. China produces about half the world's steel and consumes about 48 percent. Much of its remainder ends up on the U.S. market."

2015-05-11,Morningstar: Home Construction Boom Just Around The Corner,"A boom in housing construction is just around the corner, an analyst said Monday. An improving job market and loosening lending standards will unleash pent-up demand and lead to the best decade for residential construction since the 1970s, in the view of Morningstar's Daniel Rohr. Top sector picks according to Rohr: the lumber concern Weyerhaeuser Co (NYSE: WY), steelmaker Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and home builder NVR, Inc. (NYSE: NVR). Banks well positioned to benefit from a mortgage boom include U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB), BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) and Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ: FITB), according to Rohr. Rohr forecast annual housing starts of 1.9 million by 2019, up from 1 million recorded last year and comparing with a consensus estimate of only about 1.45 million. The prediction might sound outrageous given the disappointing recovery of the past few years, Rohr said. But the outlook is so promising precisely because the recovery has been so poor. The coming decade will see millennials, the largest generation in U.S. history, form households and buy homes for the first time, Rohr said. A weak job market coupled with tight credit and high consumer debt has so far stymied what Rohr sees as inevitable demographic potential. Rohr forecast an average of 1.6 million annual housing starts through 2024, a rate bested during the postwar era only by the 1.75 million average annual starts of the 1970s."

Here’s a breakdown of the 10 names included in the report. 1. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) Support that had been holding for ConocoPhillips throughout 2015 recently broke down, leaving more room to the downside for the stock. 2. CONSOL Energy Inc (NYSE: CNX) After CONSOL recently broke below a support level dating back to early 2012, the bottom fell out of the stock. CONSOL is now trading at 10-year lows. 3. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) Nucor is currently in danger of breaking below a support level that held for the stock earlier this year. A breakdown below that level would leave much more room for downside. 4.

2015-09-16,Jefferies Shows Concern Related To Steel Sector In Q3 And Beyond,"Luke Folta of Jefferies stated in a note that headwinds facing the steel sector is stronger now than at any other time since the 2009 global downturn. Reduction in metal pricing and a lower than previously expected overall demand resulted in a 12 percent reduction to earnings forecasts and corresponding price target objectives. Companies with the highest/most defensible margins can still offer investors good value. In a report published Wednesday, Jefferies analyst Luke Folta revised his steel estimates lower, reflecting weaker U.S. demand trends and a darkened outlook for global steel prices due to a slowing Chinese demand and strong U.S. dollar. Folta's bearish stance stems from his third quarter steel survey which suggested steel demand continues to trend lower versus expectations and a recovery in steel prices is unlikely to occur in 2015. The analyst added that diminished demand is also attributed to a severe pullback in oil and gas along with incremental weakness in key industries including mining and agriculture. Folta said 52 percent of industry contacts he surveyed reported a weaker steel demand quarter over quarter while 39 percent anticipate a seasonally weaker fourth quarter. Meanwhile, prices for HRC (hot-rolled coil) saw renewed weakness to $450/t as of mid-September, although recent deals were reportedly as low as $420/t with 29 percent of contacts are expecting further incremental weakness. As such, the analyst revised his 2015 HRC price target lower by $27/t to $464 and slashed his 2016 estimates by $47/t to $476. Related Link: This Part Of Alcoa's Business Is Flying Under The Radar Value Still To Be Found In Stocks Folta stated that it has been his core thesis for some time to favor steel companies that lead the industry in terms of : 1) margins and free cash flow generation, 2) favorable low/variable cost structure, 3) high value product offering and lack of outsized cash requirements (i.e pension, capex, etc), 4) ability to enable growth through investments. In addition, companies with above average exposure to the U.S. non-residential construction market is also a favorable attribute. The analyst added that Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE: RS), Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) are companies that satisfy his criteria and offer good value. Price Target And Ratings Shares of A.M. Castle & Co (NYSE: CAS) are Hold rated with a $2.50 price target. Shares of AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE AKS) are Hold rated with a $3 price target. Shares of Commercial Metals Co. are Buy rated with a $20 price target. Shares of Nucor are Buy rated with a $52 price target. Shares of Olympic Steel, Inc.

2015-10-05,"Deutsche Bank Upgrades Allegheny Tech, Nucor, Cuts AK Steel, Century Aluminum Ahead Of Q3 Results","Metals shares have broadly plummeted, with several major stocks down more than 50 percent year-to-date. Deutsche Bank’s Jorge Beristain upgraded the ratings on Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE: ATI) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), while downgrading AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) and Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ: CENX). Beristain mentioned that the preference should be for stocks that are not excessively reliant on price hikes and have exposure to growth markets. Analyst Jorge Beristain said that steel and Aluminum prices continue to come under pressure on account of excessive global supply. Related stocks have declined, despite improvements in the US automotive, aerospace and construction markets. US finished steel imports have risen by 7 percent y/y year-to-date, while aluminum have climbed 21 percent y/y. “In steel, we expect trade case penalties to be effected by late 2015/early 2016 and scrap prices to move lower,” Beristain mentioned. The Deutsche Bank report added that while import pressure may ease by 2016, pricing could take longer to recover. “Our sector preference is for companies not excessively geared and with exposure to growth markets,” Beristain commented. Allegheny Technologies Beristain upgraded Allegheny Technologies from Hold to Buy, while reducing the price target from $27 to $20. The Deutsche Bank report stated that the rating change was based on valuation, following the pushback in the company’s shares in 3Q15. The price target had been reduced to reflect lower revenue and earnings assumptions on account of lower stainless steel and nickel pricing. Nucor Beristain upgraded Nucor from Hold to Buy, while maintaining a price target of $52. The analyst said that the revised rating was based on valuation upside, following the decline in the company’s shares in 3Q15. “Additionally lower anticipated scrap costs offset the impact of lower steel prices,” he wrote. AK Steel Beristain downgraded AK Steel from Buy to Hold, while reducing the price target from $6 to $3. The company is reliant on hikes in spot steel prices over the next 12 to 18 months. The analyst cited uncertainty related to contract negotiations with automotive customers, which accounts for more than 50 percent of shipments, as another reason for the rating change. Century Aluminum Beristain downgraded Century Aluminum from Buy to Hold, while reducing the price target from $10 to $7. The analyst cited lower aluminum pricing and production cutbacks as concern areas."
2015-10-19,This Mining ETF Is Trying To Mount A Comeback,"Shares of non-precious metals miners have continued slumping this year as highlighted by the performances of exchange-traded funds dedicated to coal producers and steelmakers. However, the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME) has recently been perking up, rising more than 2 percent over the past month. That might not sound like much, but consider this: The $259 million XME is down 40.5 percent this year and more than 47 percent over the past year. XME Headwinds Slack global economic growth forecasts and flooding of the market with cheap steel by foreign producers are among the headwinds XME and its 30 holdings have had to deal with in recent years. Slumping steelmakers are a significant problem for XME, as the ETF devotes 48 percent of its weight to that group. That makes steel producers XME's larges industry weight at nearly quadruple the weight assigned to diversified miners, the ETF's second-largest sector exposure. Related Link: Bullish Leveraged Gold Miners ETFs Are On Fire “An appreciating U.S. dollar, excess global capacity due to weaker demand in China and the influx of cheap imports has negatively impacted U.S. domestic steel producers’ market share and margins due to the extreme price competition,” said S&P Capital IQ in a note out Monday. “However, S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Matthew Miller believes the worst is over for steel producers and we see upcoming catalysts from pending trade case determinations. He thinks that imports will revert back down to historical levels, allowing steel producers to benefit from a gradually improving construction market, impressive automobile demand, and an aerospace industry poised to experience a long-term secular uptrend.” XME Allocations XME features four steelmakers among its top 10 holdings, including Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), which accounts for 4.4 percent of the ETF's weight. S&P Capital IQ has a Strong Buy rating on Nucor, the largest U.S. steelmaker. “According to Miller, NUE's strategy to become more vertically integrated with its new Louisiana direct reduced iron plant will result in generally less volatile production costs. The new plant will enhance NUE's low-cost position in the U.S. steel industry. “For the longer term, he sees earnings rising on U.S. economic growth, strong automotive demand, and a recovery in U.S. nonresidential steel demand and better control of raw material costs. In 2016, S&P Capital IQ forecasts $3.18 in 2016, up from $1.67 in 2015, driven in part by 8 percent revenue growth,” said the research firm. XME's Catalysts XME has also recently been boosted by the resurgence of precious metals miners, as the ETF allocates a combined 23.2 percent of its weight to precious metals miners. Up nearly 13 percent over the past month, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is among the leaders of the precious metal miners ETF comeback. “GDX has $5 billion in assets and it trades on average 63 million shares on a daily basis with a $0.01 bid/ask spread,” said S&P Capital IQ. GDX is top heavy, as its top 10 holdings combine for over half the ETF's weight. Image Credit: Public Domain"
2015-11-24,"Steel Price To Recover In 2016, Major Bank Predicts","Timna Tanners of Bank of America is expecting 2016 benchmark US hot rolled coil (HRC) to average $455/short ton, marking an increase from current spot prices of around $375 to $390 per ton. Tanners suggested that minimills will prove to be the more attractive investment option. The analyst added that United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) could only see a near-term boost from trade case and mill price hike headlines. US hot rolled coil (HRC) are currently selling for $375 to $390 per ton on the spot market. According to Timna Tanners of Bank of America, HRC prices are expected to increase to an average of $455/short ton in 2016, marking a more modest rebound than previously thought. Tanners previously projected HRC prices would rise to $475/t in 2016. Her revised focus was attributed to a lower base than previously expected given the recent market implosion. The analyst added that her China steel team is now forecasting a decline of 1.2 percent in global demand growth through 2016, but net exports will remain high at 91 million mt versus 96 million mt expected in 2015. Minimills To Take Share, Nucor A ‘Wildcard' According to Tanners, minimills will increasingly be the more attractive investment option heading into 2016 as the integrateds (such as US Steel and AK Steel) will only see a near-term boost from trad case and mill price hike headlines. However, the price hikes may prove to be insufficient to enable the integrateds to return to profitability. Tanners added that both US Steel and AK Steel face lower annual contract pricing on 25-33 percent of shipments next year. In addition to that, US Steel will likely face liquidity issues in 2017 given a $450 million maturity mid 2017 and another $500 million maturity in early 2018. Tanners also noted that Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) is the wild card heading into 2016 as it is uncertain if it will use the projected $2.2 billion in free cash flow it will generate in 2015 for any accretive activity. Ratings And Price Targets Shares of AK Steel remain Underperform rated with an unchanged $1 price target. Shares of Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) remain Neutral rated with an unchanged $17 price target. Shares of Nucor remain Buy rated with an unchanged $52 price target.

2016-01-14,Is Jefferies The Steel Industry's Virgil In This Not-So-Divine Comedy?,"Jefferies released its equity research note on Wednesday, remaining cautious on the steel sector; however, the firm also highlighted that it has a preference for the United States over Europe. The firm alluded to a key passage from poet Dante in its latest research note in reference to China, 'The path to paradise begins in hell,' but we must determine which level of hell we are at to judge how close we are to the end. With Chinese demand contracting, trade policy providing limited salvation and 'bull case' restructuring bringing years of volatility, we have far to go before reaching the ninth circle. We remain cautious but prefer US vs Euro steel, Jeffries noted. A Look Into A Few Names Jefferies sees Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE: RS) and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) as benefitting from low cost positions and leveraging from the non-resi cycle.

Artisan Partners Asset Management Inc trades at a significant discount to the sector, the firm commented, and Buy-rated ThyssenKrupp AG has de-rated significantly over the past year on their estimate. Jefferies Underperform-rated ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE: MT) continues to trade at roughly stagnant multiples, despite being the worst Euro sector performer of 2015, as deteriorating earnings and FCF trends put consensus earnings/valuation estimates at risk, the firm commented. Last year, the U.S. and euro steel sectors experienced significant weakness, with the average stock down 29 percent during the year. Restructuring In China And Hell Versus Paradise Jefferies sees Chinese restructuring as necessary; however, this may be a double-edged sword. While many people say 'If you're going through hell... keep going,' we are left wondering just how close we are to the end at this point. In the terms of Dante's 'Divine Comedy,' when do we reach the ninth circle of hell? And if we survive this process, will steel ever return to paradise? the firm commented. The Chinese government has indeed begun to speak increasingly aggressively about the necessity and benefits of restructuring over the past year, and a newfound focus on environmental policy should prove supportive, Jefferies noted. Further, the Chinese steel industry has roughly $520 billion in total debt held largely by Chinese SOE banks; do Chinese banks and policymakers have the stomach to manage an impending default crisis that will naturally come alongside steel plant closures?

2016-01-14,"Jefferies Remains Cautious On Steel Sector, But Prefers US Over Europe","Jefferies released its equity research note on Wednesday, remaining cautious on the steel sector, however the firm also highlighted that it has a preference for the US over Europe. The firm noted a key quote from Dante in its latest research note in reference to China, The path to paradise begins in hell, but we must determine which level of hell we are at to judge how close we are to the end. With Chinese demand contracting, trade policy providing limited salvation and bull case restructuring bringing years of volatility, we have far to go before reaching the ninth circle.

2016-01-22,Morgan Stanley Sees Positive Momentum In Steel Heading Into Q4; Negative On Coal Names,"Morgan Stanley’s Evan L Kurt mentioned that positive steel market commentary could drive certain heavily shorted names; conversely negative coal commentary may limit upside to some stocks. While 4Q should reflect positive momentum in US steel prices, the coal market conditions have deteriorated, Kurt stated. Positive Momentum In US Steel Prices The easing of imports and inventory headwinds combined with some mill outages have resulted in US steel prices rising from below $360/t to about $400/t in recent weeks. This positive momentum could be dampened to some extent by soft underlying demand as well as weak global pricing, analyst Evan Kurt said. He expects prices to continue to rise and average $445/t in 2016, which may result in downward revisions to Street estimates for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) [Rating: Equal-Weight, PT: $19], AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) [Rating: Equal-Weight, PT: $5] and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) [Rating: Equal-Weight, PT: reduced from $62 to $59]. Kurt commented that Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) is “the safest way to play a modest steel market recovery,” while adding, “That said, heavily shorted names such as X and AKS could squeeze into results, but we would sell the news.” The rating for Steel Dynamics is maintained at Overweight, while the price target has been reduced from $28 to $27. The analyst also mentioned that Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF) was a “high cost producer in an oversupplied iron ore market.” He has an Underweight rating for the company and a price target of $2. Negative On Coal Names “No need to own coal names into the quarter,” Kurt wrote. He explained that coal market conditions had deteriorated in recent months, with a warmer-than-normal winter leading to large build-ups of coal inventories. “We think producer commentary will take on a negative tone, which will keep longs on the sidelines and bolster conviction in shorts,” the Morgan Stanley report stated. Kurt downgraded the ratings for CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX) and Foresight Energy LP (NYSE: FELP) from Overweight to Equal-Weight, while maintaining price targets of $29 and $12, respectively. He said that the changed ratings reflected an adjustment “for our reduced coal coverage footprint.”"

2016-02-29,KeyBanc's Gibbs Cuts Rating On Nucor Corp After New Guidance,"KeyBanc Capital Markets’ Philip Gibbs downgraded the rating for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) from Overweight to Sector Weight, while removing the price target. He expressed concern regarding the company's lackluster 1Q outlook, higher scrap costs, weaker plate/bar pricing, and higher corporate SG&A. Nucor projected FIFO profitability in 1Q to be somewhat similar q/q, implying 1Q FIFO EBITDA guidance of ~$251M and $237.4M on a LIFO basis, analyst Philip Gibbs said. He added, “If taken literally to mean flattish, this is ~40% below the Street's LIFO of $400M and 34% below our prior $362M.” The 1Q EBITDA estimate has been reduced from $362M to $325M to reflect higher scrap input costs. Although Nucor’s guidance has historically been conservative, this time it appears significantly short of expectations, Gibbs commented. The LIFO EBITDA estimate for FY16 has been reduced from $1.9B to $1.6B, versus the Street's $1.9B. The reduction reflects a more lackluster 1Q baseline and higher scrap cost assumptions. The LIFO EPS estimates for 1Q and 2016 have been reduced from $0.27 to $0.20 and from $1.89 to $1.25, respectively. “NUE noted in its 10-K that despite macro headwinds, it sees 2016 to be on par with 2015 from a sales and profit perspective (ex-LIFO), implying LIFO EBITDA around $1.3B (>30% below the Street). We see this as conservative, likely embedding weaker Steel volumes vs. our +5% YOY view and a mark-to-market of scrap inputs (and perhaps some potential modest inflation),” Gibbs wrote. The analyst believes that solid FCFE, dividend yield support, and long-term opportunities for market share gains would offer downside protection to Nucor’s shares."
2016-03-11,Credit Suisse Bullish On Steel Sector,"Credit Suisse’s Curt Woodworth initiated coverage of the US Steel Sector with a bullish view. He mentioned that the US market seemed to be close to a cyclical low point for volume and pricing, and the outlook for both is very strong for the rest of 2016. Global demand seems to be in a strong recovery mode, backed by a seasonal upswing in Chinese demand, while there has been a slow ramp in global supply following curtailments during end-2015. Global prices have surged over the past several months and “we believe US prices are likely to experience the strongest recovery as not only will prices increase with the global market but premiums to foreign material should expand from trade case protection,” analyst Curt Woodworth wrote. Outperform Ratings The price target for Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) is at $25. The company is America’s lowest cost flat rolled producer, with the highest earnings leverage to a recovery in the US flat rolled market. The analyst expects EAF metals spreads for sheet products to widen significantly in 2Q, providing EPS upside to Street expectations. Steel Dynamics has strong potential for organic growth on mix upgrades. The price target for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) is at $19. The company is expected to generate high incremental margins as volume recovers. Woodworth believes that States Steel would beat FCF and EBITDA expectations for 2016. The company has the highest leverage to spot market recovery, he added. Neutral Ratings The price target for Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) is at $16. Metals spreads in rebar and MBQ are weakening, while US non-residential construction trends remain mixed, the analyst said. The price target for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) is at $42. Although the company’s sheet exposure is merely 40 percent of volume, it is well positioned for robust growth in mid-2016, Woodworth mentioned. He added, however, that plate markets remained very weak and there was significant import pressure in rebar and MBQ. Underperform Rating The price target for AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) is at $2. “AK Steel’s high fixed cost base, slab short position, and Ashland outage are major headwinds” and the company is expected to burn cash at rate of $43mm in 2016 and $109mm in 2017, Woodworth commented."

2016-03-11,U.S. Metals: Balancing A Constructive Domestic Macro Environment Against China Risks,"In their US Metals & Mining Industry report, Credit Suisse’s Curt Woodworth mentioned that the US macro outlook remained “supportive,” with strong medium-term growth potential in both automotive and non-residential construction. Apart from China macro risks, the market has grown increasingly concerned about US demand trends, after the significant volume weakness witnessed in the back half of 2015 and softer micro data-points across energy, industrial and commercial construction markets. Analyst Curt Woodworth expects a strong rebound in US demand, backed by required restocking as well as strength in automotive and a marginal improvement in commercial construction. US Steel: Strong Outlook For Volume And Pricing Woodworth initiated coverage of the US Steel Sector with a bullish stance. He mentioned that the US market seemed close to a cyclical low point in terms of volume and pricing, and both may increase significantly through the rest of 2016.

Credit Suisse initiated coverage of United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) with an Outperform rating and a price target of $19. Woodworth expects the company to achieve margin expansion with a recovery in volumes. States Steel may outperform expectations for FCF and EBITDA in 2016. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) has been initiated with a Neutral rating and a price target of $16. The analyst cited downside risk to both merchant bar and rebar metal margins over the next few quarters as reason for the cautious stance. Woodworth initiated coverage of Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) with a Neutral rating and a price target of $42. Nucor’s sheet exposure is only 40 percent of volume. The analyst added, however, that the company is poised for strong growth in mid-2016, although plate markets continued to be weak and there was significant import pressure in rebar and MBQ. Credit Suisse initiated coverage of AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) with an Underperform Rating and a price target of $2. Woodworth said that AK Steel may struggle for the next several years due to structural challenges for US integrated producers as well as the company’s sizeable debt and legacy liabilities. Moreover, AK Steel has a high fixed cost base and Ashland could remain idle through at least Q216. Iron-Ore: Hold Your Breath While mentioning that iron prices were up 66 percent off their 2015 bottom, Woodworth mentioned that Credit Suisse's Commodities team was bearish on the medium-term iron-ore fundamentals. The price estimate for 2H16 is $35/tonne, “as Chinese demand remains structurally weak and a new wave of supply enters the market.” The analyst added that volume trends in the US remain bearish on account of significant structural challenges facing integrated producers. Woodworth initiated coverage of Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF) with an Underperform rating and a price target of $1. He believes there is significant downside on balance sheet and valuation concerns. Cliffs’ shares are up 63 percent year-to-date, versus a 2 percent decline in the S&P500. The outperformance has been driven by iron ore seasonality, rather than company-specific factors, Woodworth commented. He added that while the company may have enough liquidity over the next 18-24 months, its liquidity position is likely to tighten significantly in 1Q17 and it may face a liquidity crunch in 2018. US Aluminum Sector Credit Suisse initiated coverage of the US Aluminum Sector with a bullish view on downstream markets and a cautiously optimistic view on upstream markets. “We believe upstream markets have bottomed owing to aggressive supply side curtailments and sharp declines in Chinese supply growth,” Woodworth wrote. The coverage of Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA) has been initiated with an Outperform rating and a price target of $13. The stock is significantly undervalued based on SOTP analysis, the analyst mentioned. Alcoa has plans to split into 2 separate companies in 2H16. As primary aluminum recovers, there could be upside to the price target. Woodworth initiated coverage of Constellium NV (NYSE: CSTM) with an Outperform rating and a price target of $10. The analyst named this stock as the top idea in the aluminum sector, citing its depressed valuation and positive near-term catalysts. He added, “We expect CSTM to de-risk the Wise acquisition by creating a JV for future BiW growth and reducing capex via increased merchant / in-house supply.” Credit Suisse initiated coverage of Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (NASDAQ: KALU) with a Neutral rating, and a price target of $85. Woodworth termed the stock as a defensive play, citing the company’s favorable macro exposure to aerospace / automotive light weighting as well as best-in-class ROIC and FCF generation. The rating reflects the stock’s rich valuation."

2016-03-16,Bank Of America: Steel Dynamics A Better Bet Than U.S. Steel,"In a recent industry overview, Bank of America Merrill Lynch looked into the U.S. steel industry against the backdrop of the U.S. Commerce Department's preliminary dumping tariff decision. The document outlined tariffs on HRC imports (hot rolled coil imports) prohibitive as follows: Australia: 23 percent Brazil: 34 percent Japan: 6–11 percent Korea: 4–7 percent Turkey: 5–7 percent The UK: 49 percent Bank of America considers anything below 10 percent less prohibitive, depending on the U.S. price premium to other countries. What It Means While the final decision is not slated until August 3, the tariff decisions have been in the works since August 2015. In regards to what the tariff means and what the decisions imply, Bank of America explained, As a result of the expected tariff decision, imports slowed into year-end 2015. Related Link: Credit Suisse Bullish On Steel Sector These declines in addition to mill curtailments and seasonal demand have contributed to a tighter market. Import volumes already fell on the back of the investigations, yet we would expect some further net declines as Brazil and Australian imports fall, even as Turkish and Japanese tons perhaps rise, said Bank of America. For the near term, Bank of America anticipates relative strength, but questions its sustainability. We recently got more conviction on sheet price upward momentum after channel checks this week suggested markets have gotten tighter, the firm said. While rising prices can invite more imports and capacity to restart, we see a delay before any incremental tons can affect the market. Through May U.S. domestic prices may continue to rise, after which upward momentum could be challenged by seasonally slower demand, restarts, and or/higher imports. A Few Names The industry note highlighted Steel Dynamics, Inc.

2016-03-21,Jefferies Downgrades Steel Giants En Masse,"Despite recent evidence that the steel market is improving, bolstered by near-term upside, Jefferies issued an industry note, broadly downgrading top steel companies. Jefferies cited seasonal restocking, demand growth and mounting protectionist trade barriers as all near-term tailwinds. However, the analysts remain cautious, [W]e fear momentum may run out of steam into summer. Following a strong run of equity performance for US steelmakers, valuations are increasingly hard to justify. Downgrades Therefore, the firm downgraded Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE: RS), Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC), Olympic Steel, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZEUS) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) to Hold for the first three and Underperform for the last, respectively. Related Link: U.S. Metals: Balancing A Constructive Domestic Macro Environment Against China Risks Regarding U.S. Steel, Jefferies stated, Following a strong rally YTD, we downgrade X to Underperform as the company's stretched valuation appears hard to justify in the absence of a more meaningful price recovery than forecast […] we expect X to underperform peers as steel price momentum dissipates into summer. Speaking toward the three downgrades to Hold, Jefferies commented, Despite an improving steel market outlook after a deep Q4 trough, strong YTD equity performance leaves sector valuation hard to justify at 8.8x 2016 EV/EBITDA vs historical ave 6.7x. The downgrades to Hold reflect increasingly stretched vals on both 2016 and even 2017 earnings in addition to relatively less incremental exposure to recovering flat steel prices than seen amongst peers. Others In addition to the four downgrades, Jefferies' note commented that the firm currently holds Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) as top picks in the space. While STLD and NUE vals are lofty, we continue to see incremental upside as investors seek out higher-quality exposure to recovering prices backed by strong FCF and balance sheets, the analysts elaborated, Further, should price momentum disappoint into summer and bring a valuation correction, STLD & NUE stand out with the most defensive risk/reward. At Time Of Writing… Steel Dynamics was seen down 0.89 percent at $21.69. Nucor was seen down 1.71 percent at $45.90. Reliance Steel & Aluminum was down 2.68 percent at $68.28. Olympic Steel was down 2.90 percent at $16.39. Commercial Metals was down 4.23 percent at $16.43. U.S. Steel was down 5.33 percent at $14.92."
2016-03-23,"These Steel Numbers Just 'Escalated Quickly,' Are You Buying?","Credit Suisse’s Curt Woodworth said that the global steel market is rebalancing swiftly, after last year’s fallout from the energy market, substantial destocking, and distressed exports from China. Over the past several weeks, global HRC prices have risen to ~$370/ton, with global CRC prices approaching $500/ton. “Turkish scrap and Chinese billet prices also continue to move higher providing cost support,” analyst Curt Woodworth wrote. US Flat Rolled Woodworth expects US HRC prices to reach $480/ton and CRC price to approach $640/ton by the end of 2Q16, before trending lower in the back half of the year, as the supply chain normalizes. The US market has the most robust fundamentals among the global steel market over the rest of this year. Restocking, import share gains and end demand growth are expected to drive domestic flat rolled volumes sharply higher in 2016. Flat Rolled Import “In the past two weeks, CIS and China export prices increased by $60-80/tonne for CRC and many foreign mills are restricting export quotes until prices settle in Asia,” the analyst mentioned. United States Steel Corporation: A Top Pick Woodworth maintained an Outperform rating for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), while raising the price target from $19 to $22. He said that the company has the highest operating and financial leverage to a recovery in the US steel sector. Every 5 percent increase in volume and $50/ton move in ASP impacts the company’s annual EBITDA by ~$400mm. The analyst expressed optimism regarding US Steel being able to capture a significant share from imports and the restock opportunity set in 2016. “Given US Steel's high fixed cost base, we believe incremental margins will be very high near 40-50% as volumes start to recover,” the Credit Suisse report added. Steel Dynamics Woodworth maintained an Outperform rating for Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), while raising the price target from $25 to $27. He expects the shares to trade above historical average multiples, backed by the company’s “compelling growth potential in value add sheet and product mix upgrades in the long product markets of SBQ and rail.” The analyst believes that the company is “uniquely positioned” to leverage its robust balance sheet for additional organic growth projects as well as acquisitions. AK Steel Credit Suisse maintained an Underperform rating for AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), while raising the price target from $2.00 to $3.50. Woodworth noted that the company has about 10-15 percent exposure to the direct spot market and about 20 percent of the contract customer base has price levels linked to published indices. The adjusted EBITDA estimate for 2016 has been raised from $238mm to $352mm to reflect higher volumes and pricing in value add sheet. Nucor The analyst maintained a Neutral rating for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), while raising the price target from $42 to $45. He said that Nucor’s mid-quarter update had beaten expectations and the company had indicated that profitability should improve in 2016. “We viewed this very positively for Nucor given the large hurdle the company faces on LIFO (~$60mm charge forecast for 2016 vs $467mm benefit in 2015). While we remain cautious on the outlook for long products and plate, Nucor has significant leverage to the flat rolled market where metal spreads have widened significantly over the past month,” Woodworth wrote."
2016-03-23,Be Warned Metals Investors: Deutsche Bank Just Moved To The Sidelines,"Deutsche Bank’s Jorge Beristain mentioned that although commodity prices had rallied year-to-date, supply cuts are required across most commodities, while companies need to focus on reducing debt levels. The commodity price rally year-to-date has been driven by incrementally positive data from China. This trend is unlikely to continue, analyst Jorge Beristain commented, while adding that supply cuts were needed across most commodities. The good news is that the higher commodity prices had resulted in a significant tightening of credit spreads, which had opened “a window of opportunity.” Beristain expects further equity issuances and debt refinancing going ahead, “as the sector continues to re-shape.” Barrick Gold Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE: ABX) – downgraded from Buy to Hold. Barrick’s performance has been sluggish following its decision to acquire copper producer Equinox Minerals for $7.4bn in April 2011. Beristain mentioned, however, that Barrick had taken “significant steps to restructure its portfolio and streamline its operating model.” The company made several asset sales to reduce debt and achieve its $3bn target for 2015. It has planned a $2bn debt reduction for 2016. Hecla Mining Hecla Mining Company (NYSE: HL) – downgraded from Buy to Hold. “The company's primary growth initiative is the development of the #4 Shaft at Lucky Friday which could increase output from ~3m oz to ~5m oz and extend mine life beyond 2030,” Beristain wrote. The downgrade is based on valuation and the Hold rating reflects a balanced risk-reward. Pan American Silver Pan American Silver Corp. (USA) (NASDAQ: PAAS) – downgraded from Buy to Hold. “Pan American's medium term outlook depends on continued cost reduction efforts and successful execution of brownfield expansion at La Colorada and the Dolores Pulp agglomeration,” the analyst comment. The company has a robust balance sheet, which offers it significant flexibility to pursue acquisitions, which could translate into substantial value for its shareholders. The downgrade is based on valuation and the Hold rating reflects a balanced risk-reward. Coeur Mining Coeur Mining Inc (NYSE: CDE) – downgraded from Hold to Sell. “Management has partially transformed Coeur in terms of its balance sheet and asset quality. The near term outlook is dependent on steady state operations at Kensington and Palmarejo and the brownfield expansion at Rochester,” the Credit Suisse report noted. The downgrade follows the recent run up in the company’s shares. Reliance Steel Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE: RS) – downgraded from Buy to Hold. “The company's focus on small, quick turnaround orders, value-added processing and opportunistic growth/diversification strategy has enabled it to maintain industry-leading through the cycle operational performance,” Beristain mentioned. He added that Reliance had attractive end-market exposure, was likely to generate robust FCFs, had a healthy balance sheet and its long-term organic and inorganic growth potential was significant. The downgrade in rating is based on valuation. Nucor Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) - downgraded from Buy to Hold. The price target has been raised from $48 to $50. The analyst wrote, “Despite the company's leverage to NA construction market recovery, favorable cost position and investment grade balance sheet, we rate Nucor a Hold on valuation.” Freeport-McMoRan Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX) – Rated Hold. The price target has been raised from $6 to $9. Freeport’s O&G portfolio is now “evenly split between mature cash-flowing California assets and high growth, long life, Gulf of Mexico (GoM) assets,” the Credit Suisse report stated. Beristain added, however, that declining O&G prices had exerted pressure on the company’s balance sheet, despite efforts like equity issuance, stake sale and reduction in costs and capex. AK Steel AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) – Rated Sell. The price target has been raised from $1 to $2. On September 16, 2014, the company completed the acquisition of Severstal's Dearborn integrated plant for $690m in cash, funded through a combination of debt and equity. The deal expands AK Steel's annual steel shipping capacity, provides scale and operational flexibility and strengthens the company’s position in the automotive grade steel market. “However, we rate AK Steel a Sell due to higher cost structure and Balance Sheet risks,” Beristain said. Steel Dynamics Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) – Rated Buy. The price target has been raised from $23 to $25. On September 16, 2014, Steel Dynamics completed the acquisition of Severstal's Columbus mini-mill for ~$1.7bn in cash. The deal expanded Steel Dynamics’ annual steel shipping capacity by ~40 percent to 11m tons. “We rate Steel Dynamics a Buy, citing industry-leading cost structure, attractive product mix and exposure to recovering construction market,” the analyst wrote. United States Steel Corporation United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) – Rated Sell. The price target has been raised from $4.50 to $8. “US Steel has been swift in tackling recent headwinds (depressed oil prices, elevated inventories and high imports), by undertaking maintenance outages and idling/adjusting production rates across other facilities,” Beristain mentioned. He added, however, that the company’s efforts to reduce costs have been insufficient to offset the impact of lower pricing and reduced volumes. Allegheny Technologies Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE: ATI) – Rated Hold. The price target has been raised from $10 to $13. The company produces niche products and has exposure to differentiated end-markets, such as aerospace and defense, chemical processing, oil & gas and power generation. Century Aluminum Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ: CENX) – Rated Hold. The price target has been raised from $6 to $7. Beristain expects the company to produce ~740k tons in 2016. Moreover, Century Aluminum has a carbon anode facility in Netherlands and a 40 percent stake in a plant in China. The analyst expressed concern, however, regarding an anticipated decline in the company’s earnings through 2016 to 2018, due to commodity price headwinds."
2016-03-26,"U.S.-China Steel Price Spread At Multi-Year Low, Here's How To Play It","In a new report, J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Gambardella takes a look at the shrinking U.S. price premium on steel versus China. According to the report, the hot-rolled coil (HRC) spread has dipped to only $54/ton, its lowest level in three years. “The main drivers of the narrowing are higher Chinese steel prices, which reflect a pickup in demand and lower supply with low steel output and inventors levels,” Gambardella explains. Related Link: IEA: The Next Oil Price Shock Could Be To The Upside The U.S./China HRC spread was as high as $233/ton as recently as 2014. Chenese steel prices have spiked 33 percent in the past week from $300/mt to $400/mt. A pickup in Chinese steel demand and improving sentiment are the primary reasons for the spike. In the U.S., J.P. Morgan expects that steel prices will continue to climb throughout 2016 due to domestic supply cuts and reductions in imports. Gambardella notes that, since China accounts for about half of global steel production, rising Chinese prices are certainly a boost for U.S. producers. However, he adds that high Chinese prices are not a critical part of the bull thesis for U.S. producers. J.P. Morgan names United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) as its top steel stock picks.

2016-04-05,"Major Steel Players Set For Better 2017, JPMorgan Says","Higher steel prices have set the stage for improved performances by the major players in the Steel industry. JPMorgan’s Michael F. Gambardell commented on four Steel majors, revisiting their estimates. US Steel Analyst Michael Gambardell maintained an Overweight rating for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), while raising the estimates for 2017 and the price target to $28. “We continue to believe that domestic steel sheet prices should be supported by U.S. supply cuts in the form of reduced imports from positive sheet trade case rulings as well as domestic capacity curtailments,” Gambardell wrote. AK Steel The analyst maintained an Overweight rating for AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), while raising the EPS estimate for 2017 and reinstating the price target at $6. He said that US carbon sheet steel prices were rising, backed by domestic production cuts, declining imports due to positive preliminary duties from the three sheet trade cases, and China’s improving steel metrics. “By themselves, we believe production cuts and lower U.S. imports are enough to push carbon steel sheet prices higher in the US, and we expect structurally higher prices going forward,” Gambardell commented. Nucor JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), while raising the EPS estimate for 2017 and the price target to $55. Gambardell believes mini-mills like Nucor would continue to witness margin expansion, with steel prices increasing faster than scrap prices. “US steel prices should continue to be supported by supply cuts in the form of reduced imports due to positive sheet trade case rulings as well as domestic capacity curtailments,” the analyst stated. He explained that although scrap prices are likely to rise, the increase will not be at the same rate as the rise in US steel prices, since the strong USD makes it more difficult for the US to export scrap. Steel Dynamics Gambardell maintained an Overweight rating for Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD), while raising the 2017 EPS estimate and the price target to $29, citing higher steel prices."

2016-06-08,Credit Suisse Upgrades Steel Stocks On Increasing U.S. Steel Price,"“We remain very bullish on the US steel industry,” Credit Suisse’s Curt Woodworth said in a report, while significantly raising the spot and contract price deck. The analyst expects the US flat rolled market to continue to tighten over the next several months. Analyst Curt Woodworth said that investors seem to be underestimating structural change in the US sheet market. He named the top picks as AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS), United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD). AK Steel Woodworth upgraded the rating for AK Steel from Underperform to Outperform, saying that the company had underappreciated spot leverage and was poised to benefit significantly from stronger contract prices in 2017. The price target has been raised from $3.50 to $7, reflecting higher EBITDA and FCF estimates. Previous concerns related to liquidity had been alleviated following the company’s recent equity offering. The analyst believes AK Steel is in a “strong position to de-lever the balance sheet over the next several years and selectively repurchase longer dated debt at a discount to par value.” He forecasted significant FCF generation over the next several years. US Steel Woodworth maintained an Outperform rating for US Steel, while raising the price target from $22 to $26. He expects the company to be able to “recapture most of the contract ASP headwind from 2016.” The analyst raised the 2016 and 2017 EBITDA estimates to $640mm and $1.2bn, respectively, reflecting the revised price deck, higher 2017 contract prices, and improved conversion cost metrics associated with higher utilization rate expectations. The FCF forecasts are at $281mm and $387mm, respectively. Steel Dynamics Credit Suisse maintained an Outperform rating for Steel Dynamics, while raising the price target from $27 to $33. “In our view, STLD has compelling upside over the medium term as the company continues to expand capacity and upgrade product mix within the US value add sheet market,” Woodworth wrote. Metal spreads for US flat rolled products are likely to remain above mid-cycle levels through 2018, while a significant jump in volumes for both sheet and long products is likely to result in a strong improvement in conversion cost metrics. The EBITDA estimate for 2016 and 2017 have been raised to $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. “Importantly, STLD has compelling future organic and inorganic growth potential and we expect STLD to announce incremental projects to fully utilize spare hot metal capacity across its steel facility base,” the analyst added. Nucor Woodworth maintained a Neutral rating for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), while raising the price target from $45 to $55. He commented, “While we recognize that EBITDA growth in 2016 might be underappreciated, NUE's lower exposure to the healthiest steel products in the near term makes this a less compelling story in the space in our view.”"
2016-06-15,Bank Of America Calls Steel Prices 'As Good As It Gets',"Bank of America has raised its steel price forecast but sees no remaining upside for now. The firm has upped its U.S. benchmark hot rolled coil (HRC) 2016 average price estimate from $485 to $530/short ton. Analyst Timna Tanners is calling for HRC prices to peak at $600/t in Q3 before pulling back in Q4. “Sheet market strength has been driven by supply constraints, as trade cases and higher Q1 Asian prices reduced import offers and AKS and X have each kept blast furnaces idle,” Tanners explained. Related Link: Global Fossil Fuel Electricity Demand Will Peak In 2025 In addition to upping its steel price outlook, Bank of America has also upgraded United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) from Underperform to Neutral due in part to its recent balance sheet improvements.

2016-07-06,Mining The Metals Sector: Deutsche Bank Updates 3 Big Names,"With Metals and Mining [M&M] commodity prices rallying ~13 percent in 2Q16, the view on Steels had become “less negative,” although the preference remains for companies with gold exposure, Deutsche Bank’s Amy Tan said in a report. She added that China's stimulus had created a financing window, boosting balance sheets in the sector. Balance Sheets Improve Balance sheet activity during 2Q16 was particularly high, with around 9 percent of the M&M sector’s market cap being issued, refinanced or sold in 1H16. This suggests that “the capital markets “window” that opened in April, effectively allowing most NA M&M companies to either re-capitalize strained Balance Sheets or extend near-term debt maturities into future periods,” analyst Amy Tan mentioned. Outlook Improves Although the metals sector requires significant supply cuts, this could take longer given the recent rise in prices. Tan added that in the absence of the needed supply cuts, prices would likely not continue the upward trend. For steel, the US HRC estimates for 2016 and 2017 have been raised by about 13 percent to an average of $520/st and by about 11 percent to $500/st, respectively. The analyst noted that the NYMEX forward December 2016 contract was currently trading at $538/st and there could be correction from these peak levels. Upgrading Three Stocks Tan mentioned that the following stocks had been upgraded because of the improved steel price outlook and balance sheet refinancing: Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) – from Hold to Buy, with price target raised from $52 to $60. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) from Sell to Hold, with price target raised from $8 to $15. The analyst also upgraded the rating on Kinross Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE: KGC) from Sell to Hold, citing valuation as the reason. The price target has been raised from $3.10 to $4.50. She added that gold exposure through Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE: NEM) was recommended. The stock is rated Buy, while the price target has been raised from $38 to $44."

2016-07-12,"U.S. Steel, Other Metals And Mining Reviewed By Barclays","Heading into the 2Q earnings season, commodity price estimates for steel have been raised. This has improved the earnings outlooks for steel companies, and resulted in an increase in the price targets of four steel stocks, Barclays’ Matthew J. Korn said in a report. The performance of metal stocks has recently been strong, albeit highly volatile, with mixed macro data from China and uncertainly over the US interest rate policy. “Our sense is that investors are going into 2H pleased with metal companies' operations, anticipating upward estimate revisions, but still concerned with just how long current steel and copper prices can hold,” analyst Matthew Korn wrote. Updated Estimates And Price Targets AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) – Rating maintained at Equal-weight, while price target raised from $4 to $5. The EPS estimates for FY1 and FY2 have been raised from -$0.07 to $0.26 and from $0.23 to $0.54, respectively. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) - Rating maintained at Overweight, while price target raised from $52 to $55. The EPS estimates for FY1 and FY2 have been raised from $1.98 to $2.81 and from $2.84 to $2.88, respectively. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) - Rating maintained at Overweight, while price target raised from $27 to $28. The EPS estimates for FY1 and FY2 have been raised from $1.55 to $2.01 and from $1.93 to $1.99, respectively. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) - Rating maintained at Equal-weight, while price target raised from $15 to $16. The EPS estimates for FY1 and FY2 have been raised from -$2.86 to -$1.01 and from -$0.03 to $0.57, respectively. The price targets have been raised to reflect that domestic steel prices had held above $600 per ton. “Chinese steel prices have cycled up and down again, but in the U.S. reduced capacity, limited imports, and low inventories have kept sheet tags elevated,” Korn wrote. The analyst expects HRC to decline about 13 percent to an average of $545 per ton over 2017. He added that there were “some early signs of softening from weaker scrap, shrinking lead times, and a recent step up in imports.” Despite these factors, the mini-mills were gaining market share, achieving margin expansion, and growing via new projects and targeted M&A, Korn noted.

2016-07-20,"'As Good As It Gets' In Nucor, Bank Of America Says; Downgrades To Neutral","Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) to Neutral from Buy due to a more cautious view on second-half market conditions, fuller valuation and cautious comments from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) on long products. Justification The downgrade comes as Nucor is scheduled to report its second-quarter results on July 21. The Street expects EPS of $0.70 on revenue of $4.50 billion. We continue to think NUE represents a relatively attractive investment opportunity within our coverage, but expect limited catalysts on falling steel prices and more recent full valuation, analyst Timna Tanners wrote in a note. Related Link: Barclays Adjusts Price Targets On AK Steel, CONSOL Energy And Others On Thursday's second-quarter call, the analyst said investors will focus on how much spare capacity Nucor might be able to contribute to a relatively tight sheet market after the company reportedly operated at 105 percent of capacity at its sheet mills. We expect benign market commentary, similar to STLD, although our channel checks indicate gaps of $145–200/t on delivered sheet imports relative to domestic prices. We would be keen for an update on NUE's plans for cash use given its also substantial cash hoard of $2.3 billion as of Q116, Tanners noted. Meanwhile, the analyst added that Nucor has more long products exposure than Steel Dynamics, but less than Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) at about 39 percent of 2015 sales, and has also been growing volumes in its fabricated segment. Looking Forward NUE remains relatively defensive due to variable costs and LIFO earnings, which can help offset any hit from falling prices. It also tends to import scrap, so can benefit on the margin from a stronger dollar arbitrage on scrap costs, Tanners highlighted. That said, the analyst cut 2016 EPS view to reflect expected long product margin squeeze into the second quarter and lower volumes in the third. Tanners lowered 2016 EPS forecast to $2.40 from $2.45. The analyst also trimmed 2016 revenue estimate to $18.39 billion from $18.44 billion. Average selling prices can be supported for the near term from trailing contract prices, but we expect lower prices into Q4E on our view that lower global prices ultimately pressure a lofty U.S. premium lower, Tanners added. Tanners, however, maintained the stock's price objective of $56. At time of writing, Nucor shares were down 2.62 percent on the day, trading at $54.25. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

2016-07-21,Bank Of America Sours On Steel,"Bank of America Merrill Lynch has downgraded steel stocks such as Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc.

However, Tanners maintains a $56 price objective on Nucor shares. Related Link: As Good As It Gets In Nucor, Bank Of America Says; Downgrades To Neutral Tanners also downgraded Steel Dynamics to Neutral from Buy after a strong rise in share prices on the view that steel prices have run out of steam. The analyst also cut the price target on the stock by $1 to $28. Q2 results were a beat, but the outlook was softer than expected and we lowered estimates and see consensus at risk. We continue to like STLD on a relative basis, but expect discounted import tons to pressure sheet steel markets into Q4, Tanners wrote in a note. Tanners slashed 2016 EPS forecast to $1.90 from $2.00, compared with consensus of $2.13, and third-quarter EPS view fell to $0.57 from $0.66 versus consensus at $0.72.

2016-07-26,U.S. Steel Beats Estimates; Axiom's Johnson Fears Fundamentals Are Being Ignored In Steel Names,"After the close on Tuesday, United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) reported a Q2 adjusted loss of $0.32 per share versus estimates of a $0.53 loss. Revenues were $2.58 billion and the Street was looking for $2.67 billion. Steel names have reported better-than-consensus estimates this quarter, as many were expecting on the heels of surging steel prices: AK Steel (NYSE: AKS) beat by $0.10 Reliant Steel (NYSE: RS) beat by $0.08 Nucor (NYSE: NUE) beat by $0.03 Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) beat by $0.02 There's good reason for the recent slew of strong reports, according to Axiom's Gordon Johnson. Johnson spoke with Benzinga Tuesday and he said restructuring charges, which are backed out of Non-GAAP numbers and viewed as one-time charges (even though they are real costs), are showing that the business fundamentals are lacking for steel names in general as any benefits to the bottom line have been driven primarily through pent up spot price.

United States Steel wasn't alone in reporting a better-than-expected earnings report, and many of its peers also surprised to the upside. Benzinga reached out to Axiom's Gordon Johnson to discuss what is going on in the steel sector. Gordon Johnson On Steel According to Johnson, steel investors shouldn't hold on to an optimistic view moving forward. The analyst stated that the second quarter of a calendar year typically marks peak optimism in the steel space. Related Link: Credit Suisse Sees 26% Upside In U.S. Steel Meanwhile, auto demand (a key sector client of most steel clients) is weakening, imports are on the rise, oil prices are moving lower and there will be an impact from the Brexit vote — no matter how small. Johnson added that the market is ignoring all of these industry headwinds and it won't last forever. The analyst also suggested that the dividends offered by steel companies are not safe for the foreseeable future. Many steel companies are highly leveraged and operate with high fixed costs associated with plant maintenance. Finally, Johnson doesn't see any new regulation that could support steel prices. He stated that imported steel into the United States is now seen as on par with U.S. produced steel to the point where it is hard for steel mills not to buy imports. The US mills have went too far, and now there will be a flood of imports in 2H16 pushing steel prices lower yet again, the analyst concluded. Steel is a commodity, and the US is not the price setter. It is the price taker. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

2016-08-22,Citi Sees Little Upside In Nucor,"Citi’s Alexander Hacking noted Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) has “consistently generated industry leading ROIC over the business cycle while growing production capacity and adding more value added product offerings.” Hacking initiated coverage of the company with a Neutral rating and price target of $55. The Positives Due to its consistent above average ROIC, the company has traded at a premium to the rest of the industry. “NUE is the North American market leader in nearly every long steel product and many fabricated products, and also the third largest producer of sheet steel,” the analyst mentioned. Hacking also pointed out that Nucor is the only steel producer in North America with an investment grade rating of (A-), as well as sufficient cash and liquidity to continue to invest in improving its earnings power, which is the company’s top capital allocation priority. Related Link: Steel Dynamics Has 33% Upside, According To Citi ROIC However, since ROIC, the company’s ROIC gas averaged only 5.3 percent, driven by declining operating margins and meaningful investments in the raw material segment that are yet to pay off. “We expect some improvement in the Raw Materials segment but it will likely still under earing its cost of capital over the next several years,” Hacking stated. Dividend In addition, Nucor has a solid history of growing dividends, which has supported the shares. However, with payout ratios of more than 80 percent, the analyst believes there is little room for any significant increases in the medium term. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

2016-09-15,"Jefferies Staying Defensive On Steel Sector, Highlights Expectation For A Weak End To The Year","Steel valuation multiples would likely compress further in the near term, until pricing bottoms out, Jefferies’ Seth Rosenfeld said in a report. Although the rise in steel prices would result in solid Q3 earnings and guidance, steel shares could remain under pressure due to “the recent inflection in steel pricing and bearish survey outlook,” the analyst commented. Analyst Rosenfeld expects the derating of steel valuations to persist through the second half of 2016. Recovery Likely In 2017 US steel prices have been following a downward trajectory through Q3 due to lower raw material input costs, higher flat rolled imports and a seasonally weak demand environment. Rosenfeld expects the downturn to continue through yearend due to “incremental weakness in raw material input costs as well as supply-side pressures from ramping capacity.” A revised analysis of the flat rolled market indicates opportunity for producers to regain pricing power in the first half of 2017. Top Picks The analyst named Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) has the top and most defensive picks. He maintained Buy ratings on both stocks, although reducing their price targets from $31 to $28 for Steel Dynamics and from $60 to $55 for Nucor. The companies have lower cost operating structures and less levered balance sheets. “We concede shares will likely remain pressured near term, but expect better relative performance and ultimately absolute upside when pricing stabilizes,” Rosenfeld wrote. Worst Affected The analyst stated that integrated mills United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) were highly sensitive to absolute steel prices and faced margin risk from surging coking coal prices. Thus, these stocks would likely “face the brunt of the downside pressure.” Jefferies maintained Hold ratings on the companies, while reducing the price targets for US Steel from $24.50 to $18 and for AK Steel from $5.50 to $4.50. Other Ratings Rosenfeld maintained Hold ratings for these stocks, with the following price targets: Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) – Maintained at $16.50 Olympic Steel, Inc. (NASDAQ: ZEUS) – Lowered from $25 to $20 Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE: RS) - Maintained at $72 Ryerson Holding Corp (NYSE: RYI) – Cut from $14.50 to $12 Timkensteel Corp (NYSE: TMST) – Lowered from $11 to $9.75 Worthington Industries, Inc.

2016-09-20,The Current Environment In The Steel Space,"Steel stocks may not live up to the phrase steely nerves if recent indications from some top companies in the sector are anything to go by. As recently as Monday, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) pre-announced an earnings shortfall for the third quarter. Earlier in the month, Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) also projected an earnings shortfall despite the metric suggesting strong year-over-year growth. Jefferies Sees Price Weakness In a note published last week, Jefferies said valuation of steel stocks will compress further as unit prices bottom out. The bearish outlook and the recent inflection in steel pricing could pressure stocks in the sector despite expectations of solid third-quarter earnings and forward guidance due to higher steel prices. Steel prices in the United States have dived, pressured by higher flat-rolled imports in recent months, low raw material costs and seasonal weakness in demand. Jefferies sees the weakness facing the steel industry as persisting through the year, as there is pressure from supply side to ramp up capacity. Related Link: A Surprise Among Utilities ETFs CLSA Also Cribs On Price Weakness CLSA said it sees steel prices dropping further as lead times shrink, boosting output, and raw material prices remain soft. Risk Preference May Help However, KeyBanc raised the sector rating of the steel sector to Sector Weight from Underweight Monday. The firm said it remains cautious on the group but believes the risk-reward in the steel sector is finely balanced. Investor proclivity toward risk, according to the firm, has become a positive factor for the sector. The firm also indicated that the sector experiences seasonal momentum in the fourth quarter of the calendar year and early first quarter. Are Stocks Wilting Amid Muted Opinions? Nucor has not had much movement over the last week, although it did slip to a low of $45.35 in the aftermath of the earnings warning. Since then, the stock has recovered and is currently trading around $46. Steel Dynamics also traded in a $23–$24 range, and Monday's pre-announcement issued after the market open is pushing the stock down by close to 1 percent to $24.09. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) has pulled back from above $17 over last week and is currently down about 1 percent at $16.64. Meanwhile, AKS Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) has seen its shares a constant above $4 since the middle of August. Since September 9, the Arca Steel Index (NYSE:GIS:STEEL) has lost about 1.5 percent, while during the same period, the S&P 500 Index has gained about 0.50 percent.

2016-09-22,Barclays Maintains Overweight On Steel Dynamics As Q3 Guidance Largely Expected,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) guided to lower flat-rolled volumes and a sequentially worse recycling performance for Q3. The guidance overall was largely as anticipated, Barclays’ Matthew J. Korn said in a report. He maintained an Overweight rating on the company, with a price target of $30. Steel Dynamics projected its Q3 EPS at $0.63-$0.67, lower than Barclay’s estimate of $0.69 and the consensus expectation of $0.71. “Most of the language given in this update matches the outlook given in the 2Q release,” analyst Korn noted. Lower Volumes The company did indicate weaker flat-rolled volumes, which was similar to the recent guidance provided by Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE). Recycling Performance The main change was the guidance of a weaker performance in Recycling, Korn mentioned. He added that Steel Dynamics has been witnessing a decline in ferrous and nonferrous volumes in this business during the quarter, while lower scrap prices are adversely impacting ferrous Recycling margins. Other Guidance “For core steel ops STLD expects “meaningful spread expansion” offset by lower volumes, in line with our prior expectations. End market commentary was unchanged as energy, agriculture, and heavy equipment remain weak while relative strength in auto and construction markets continues,” the analyst wrote. Estimates Revised The near-term outlook for steel stocks appears “quite soft,” with steel prices declining, scrap prices not providing much support, imports rising, and signs of weakening end-market demand, Korn stated. He lowered the EPS estimates for Q3 and 2016 from $0.69 to $0.66 and from $2.07 to $2.05, respectively. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

2016-09-27,"10 Notable Stocks Trading Ex-Dividend Wednesday, September 28","It’s critical to know whether a stock you plan on buying has an ex-dividend status, because in case it does, the dividend would be paid out to the seller. The person who owns the stock on the ex-dividend date will be awarded the payment, which means that you’ll have to wait for the next dividend cycle to receive your first dividend payout from the company. On the other hand, share prices typically decline just after the ex-dividend date is declared, and usually by an amount equal to the expected dividend. So, this may give you the opportunity to identify a good entry point. If you’re planning on selling shares on or after the ex-dividend date, you'll receive the dividend payout from the company.

2016-11-18,Expect Nucor To Benefit From President-Elect Trump's Infrastructure Spending Plan,"Argus said in a note on Friday that it expects Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) to benefit from the Trump administration's plans to boost infrastructure spending as well as further actions to limit the dumping of imported steel. Election Result, Housing Market: Twin Catalysts Analyst David Coleman noted that the shares of Nucor, which declined in late October in reaction to its disappointing third quarter results, have rallied along with other steel stocks since the November 8 election. Additionally, the analyst sees the company benefiting from the strength in the U.S. housing market. Argus believes the company can counter the potential fourth-quarter weakness stemming from lower margins in the steel mills segment by the strength in the U.S. housing market, which accounts for 65 percent of the company's revenues. The company also expects a loss in its raw materials segment due to lower transfer prices at direct-reduced iron facilities, the firm noted. Accordingly, the company predicted a sequential decline in fourth-quarter earnings. Argus estimates earnings of $2.39 per share for 2016 and $2.99 per share for 2017. Maintaining Rating, Upping Price Target Argus maintains its Buy rating on the shares of the company, while it upped its price target to $65 from $58. The firm continues to view the company as a best-in-class steel manufacturer. At last check, Nucor was down 0.59 percent at $59.10."

2016-12-12,Steel Prices Should Rise Significantly Into First Half Of 2017,"Both U.S. and Euro steel prices will likely rise significantly into the first half of 2017, backed by a raw materials cost-push, seasonally stronger demand and lower imports, Jefferies’ Seth Rosenfeld said in a report. Rosenfeld commented that the steel markets seemed to be hitting “a cyclical sweet spot,” and prices were set to rise into H1 of 2017. The upturn would be driven mainly by: Virgin raw materials inflected in Q3, which supports Chinese and Euro steel prices. U.S. scrap has also recently “followed suit.” Moreover, cost-push steel price inflation seems to have more room to increase. The rise in Asian steel prices have been accompanied by a loss of import competitiveness, “while rising tariffs allow for expanded intra-regional price spreads,” Rosenfeld noted, adding that Trump could fill the emerging policy cracks in the United States, while the EC has launched a critical HDG (Hot-Dip Galvanizing) investigation. In the United States, steel inventories are sub-normal, and moderate in Europe. Thus, with a seasonal improvement in demand into Q1 and structurally growing in infrastructure, restocking is likely. “While 2H17 will see headwinds from growing US capacity and normalising raw materials, steel equities should continue to be supported in coming months by emerging price/vol momentum,” the analyst commented. Downgrades Rosenfeld downgraded the rating on Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC) from Buy to Hold, while raising the price target from $20 to $24. He downgraded Worthington Industries, Inc. (NYSE: WOR) from Hold Underperform, and raised the price target from $42 to $45. Despite the upward revision in estimates for U.S.-exposed mills and distributors, there seems to be “limited upside for some equities” and there is risk of near-term pullback in view of the recent sector rally. Although Commercial Metals offers attractive construction exposure, valuation seems stretched and margins could come under pressure. Worthington Industries is trading at peak multiples, and upside is limited by autos appearing poised to plateau and low construction/O&G exposure, the analyst mentioned. Top Picks Rosenfeld cited the following as the top picks in the sector, while maintaining their Buy ratings and raising their price targets: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS): from $7.50 to $13.00. ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE: MT): from €7.25 to €9.50. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE): from $55 to $77. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD): from $32 to $45."

2017-01-10,Analyst Explains Why AK Steel Was The Best Turnaround Story Of 2016,"AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) was one of 2016's hottest stocks, having gained around 125 percent over the past three months alone and more than 360 percent over the past year. Philip Gibbs of Keybanc was a guest on CNBC to explain what contributed to the extraordinary gains. According to Gibbs, AK Steel was one of the best turnaround stories of 2016 after the company's management team made some key changes, including cutting capacity and focusing on cost cutting. AK Steel also benefited in the first quarter of 2016 when it won key tariffs in the products it sells. Needless to say, after a triple-digit percentage return in 2016, investors shouldn't expect a similar performance in 2017. Gibbs stated that many of the catalysts that would have boosted AK Steel's stock have already played out. The initiatives also helped boost the company's balance sheet, which is key for long-term investors. On the other hand, the analyst noted he has become more positive on the company over the past few days given the manufacturing policies under President-elect Donald Trump's administration will be more favorable for the group as a whole and U.S. manufacturing. Gibbs did suggest that investors buy shares of Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) as a better source of alpha moving forward."
2017-01-11,"Freeport-McMoRan, Martin Marietta And Steel's Strength In The Trump Rally","The Trump rally has benefited certain sectors more than others. One of the strongest sectors that benefited is materials and metals stocks. CNBC's Dominic Chu explained that it's widely believed materials and metals stocks will benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's administration given his plans to invest $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over the coming years. The strong investor sentiment is most apparent in the exchange traded fund which trackers the materials sector, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) which is higher by more than 25 percent over the past year. In fact, among the 25 members of the S&P 500 materials sector, nine of the stocks have rallied to the point where it's trading at least 10 percent above its 200-day average trading price. Among the notables in Chu's list, the major gravel, stone and sand provider Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) is trading 15 percent above its 200-day moving average.

2017-01-12,"Credit Suisse Downgrades Steel Group, Shows Concern With Demand Side Fundamentals","With heightened supply-side concerns in the U.S. Steel Sector, there could be a steep decline in bulk material prices in H2 2017, while infrastructure stimulus is “unlikely to materially benefit US producers,” Credit Suisse’s Curt Woodworth said in a report. He downgraded the steel sector view to Market Weight, saying flat rolled prices could peak in Q1. Rating Changes Woodworth downgraded the rating on United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) from Outperform to Neutral. The price targets are at $30, $36 and $9.50, respectively. Neutral ratings are maintained for Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC), with price targets at $56 and $19. The analyst has an Underperform rating on Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF), with a price target of $6. Increased Supply Commenting on the supply side, Woodworth mentioned that Big River, US Steel Granite City and potentially Acero Junction would be ramping capacity by Q2 2017. Steel Dynamics and Novolipetsk Steel would also add to U.S. supply. There would also be higher higher production levels at Bedrock. Demand Side Woes “US steel fundamentals have been supported almost entirely by supply side benefits and cost push inflation in Asia during 2016,” the analyst noted. Despite some positives, US sheet volumes rose merely ~3 percent in 2016, while total US production declined 1 percent year-over-year, despite severe weakness in the back half of 2015. US hot rolled coil apparent consumption has remained negative for the past five months and import penetration has continued to be high relative to historical standards. Also, the MSCI index has remained weak. “We are concerned the Trump boost to equity valuations is overdone, as our analysis suggests limited benefits from infrastructure spending growth and the fact that the heavy lifting on U.S. steel trade policy has been largely finalized following changes to injury laws and successful trade case outcomes in 1H-16,” Woodworth added."
2017-01-16,Jim Cramer Gives His Opinion On L Brands And AK Steel,"Jim Cramer said on CNBC's Mad Money that he can't recommend a long position in the retail sector because it's challenged by the border tax and the mall problems.

Cramer believes that AK Steel dropped 1.62 percent on Friday, because it became overbought."
2017-01-18,Steel Expert: Wilbur Ross Comments Give Investors Unfounded Hope,"President-elect Donald Trump proved he can move the market with a word, and on Wednesday, his appointed cabinet member demonstrated a similar power. During his confirmation hearing before Congress, Wilbur Ross, the nominee for U.S. Commerce Secretary, remarked on the steel industry — and saw concurrent shifts in relevant stocks. In two separate comments, Ross identified overcapacity, particularly in China, as the industry’s primary problem, and he said tariffs may be required to stop steel and aluminum dumping. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) shot up 4.1 percent, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) rose 3.3 percent and Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) bounced 2.6 percent. But some in the industry claimed the market reactions were unfounded. Experts Assert Trade Tariffs Will Change Little In response to Ross’s comments, Axiom analyst Gordon Johnson told Benzinga that more restrictions on steel trade would have negligible impact on the industry given the many pre-existing restrictions on trade with China. “While there is a strong view that President-Elect Trump’s ‘getting hard on China’ stance will be a huge positive for the steel industry, based on the numbers, we would argue that this was accomplished during Obama’s two-term presidency,” said Johnson. Johnson, who has been negative on steel since early 2016, noted that steel imports from China plunged 63.4 percent over 2016. He expressed surprise that Ross and others in the market are now discussing the issue because it has long been a point of his concern. “We do not believe this dynamic is well understood by the lion’s share of market prognosticators at present,” he wrote. “To wit, unless more tariffs on Chinese imports are going to drive them into negative territory (at risk of stating the obvious, this is impossible), we see the market’s reaction today as misplaced.”"
2017-01-19,"Citi Steals The Thunder From Steel, Downgrades Sector","Citi in a note released on Thursday downgraded the U.S. steel sector to Neutral from Bullish, as it believes the 68 percent rally in the sector since mid-October captures the majority of the cyclical upside. The firm downgraded steel stocks AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE: AKS) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X). Steel Prices To Decline In 2H07; Citi Not Outrightly Bearish Analyst Alexander Hacking noted implied EBITDA per tons are close to peak 2007–08 levels in AK Steel and U.S. Steel. The analyst expects steel prices to decline in the second half of 2017 based on increased domestic supply, limited demand growth, lower raw materials and import parity. That said, the firm said it would not turn outright bearish due to potential structural positives such as Chinese supply side reform and U.S. government policy, having the potential to generate further upside. Raising Price Forecast Citi raised its 2017 average hot rolled coil steel price forecast to $567 per ton from $514 per ton. Nevertheless, the firm said it is cautious about buying into the last price increase, with $100 per ton downside in prices expected in the second half. Citi also noted that the import arbitrage with Turkey and Black Sea exports is now at over $150 per ton. Demand To Rise Modestly The firm expects U.S. steel demand to rise 3.5 percent in 2017, with current capacity, plus, new supply from Big River sufficient to absorb the demand, even with structurally low imports. Policy Support May Be Long Time Coming Citi sees support from new policies on trade, taxes and infrastructure. Given that details on policies are short, the firm said it is hesitant to overpay without more clarity. According to Citi, incremental demand from infrastructure would be 6 mtpy, although it is not expected at least until 2018. Ratings/Price Targets AK Steel: Downgraded to Sell from Neutral/price target raised to $8 from $5. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE: CMC): Downgraded to Neutral from Buy/price target raised to $21 from $20. Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE): Maintains at Neutral/price target raised to $65 from $50. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD): Maintains at Buy/price target raised to $43 from $30. U.S. Steel: Downgraded to Neutral from Buy/price target raised to $37 from $21. At Last Check United States Steel was down 1.66 percent at $34.35 in pre-market trading. Immediately prior to publication, the stock was down 4.71 percent at $33.28. AK Steel was slipping 3.57 percent in pre-market trading. At last check, it was down 4.87 percent at $9.58."

2017-03-14,Jim Cramer Gives His Opinion On Finisar And AK Steel,"On CNBC's Mad Money, Jim Cramer spoke about Finisar Corporation (NASDAQ:FNSR). He is worried about the stock and he doesn't like the last earnings report the company posted. He added that the sector has become overheated. Cramer thinks AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) has a chance, because the government wants to protect the U.S. market from the cheap Chinese steel. He also thinks there are some signs of bottoming on its chart. Cramer believes AK Steel is not the best stock in the sector. His favorite stock in the space is Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE)."
2017-03-31,Jim Cramer's 2 Picks For Trump's Infrastructure Project,"Despite being struck with a major defeat in healthcare, President Donald Trump remains dedicated toward overseeing a major infrastructure initiative as soon as this year. As such, investors are looking to capitalize on companies that will benefit from what could be an injection of $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over the coming decade. CNBC's Jim Cramer offered two stocks for investors to consider during Friday's Squawk on the Street segment. Marin Marietta Materials And Nucor Shares of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) were trading higher by more than 3 percent on Friday, likely as a result of Cramer naming the supplier of crushed stone, sand, and gravel as a suitable infrastructure play. Cramer's other pick, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) was trading lower by around 0.50 percent on Friday. Cramer explained that Martin Marietta is an obvious materials & aggregate play, and many infrastructure projects would need to use the company's products. Although not similar to Marin Marietta, Cramer emphasized the fact that Nucor invested billions of dollars in its business over the years which makes it a very in-expensive stock to own. Cramer also recommended investors remain cautious on Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) after the company was subject to an accounting investigation. Also, the stock is heavily shorted although at the end of the day Caterpillar remains a great American company and has strong prospects in China.

Cramer said investors are selling the steel companies because they believe the U.S. is going to have to sacrifice them in order to make a deal with China to stop supporting the government of North Korea. He would not buy United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). He added that Nucor Corporation(NYSE:NUE) is the only U.S. steel company that he can recommend as a buy."

2017-05-12,"Sympathy Moves, Explained: Unsympathetic Earnings Season Continues As Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices Diverge","Earnings season has always been a market-moving catalyst for stocks. Depending on the numbers and their quality, stocks could swing wildly in either direction and create volatility — not a palatable proposition for traders. The risk is always there. However, one can trade the volatility by understanding and identifying a few basics. One of the trends traders watch for is a sympathy move. Sympathy Moves: Sector Moving In Tandem Sympathy plays are stocks that move in sync with each other when there is news or developments that trigger movement in one stock, which could logically be played out in the other stock. The reciprocal stocks could either belong to the same sector/industry or be competitors or share a customer-supplier relationship. For example, when there is news impacting GoPro Inc (NASDAQ:GPRO), there could be some noise in Ambarella Inc (NASDAQ:AMBA) shares, as the latter supplies chips to GoPro's products. In January, when Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY) announced it was withdrawing its accelerated approval application for a combo of its immunotherapy Opdivo and Yervoy as a first-line treatment for lung cancer, the stock took a huge hit. Meanwhile, rival Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) began to take the opposite route after filing an early application for first-line approval of its lung cancer treatment candidate Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy. Source: Y Charts Diverging Toy Stories After moving in tandem for a long time, the fortunes of Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) and Mattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) have begun diverging since 2014. Both are consumer stocks operating in the toy industry, holding a virtual duopoly in the market. The prospects of these companies are tied to economic growth and the willingness of consumers to spend on discretionary toys. So, the direct relation between them is understandable, especially if the overall market is growing. However, with consumers turning more circumspect of the strength of the economic recovery, these companies are vying for their slice of the market, and a few strategic moves Mattel made backfired, resulting in the stocks' divergence. The divergence has been quite stark since the release of the first-quarter results in January. Source: Y Charts Sympathy Plays In The Chip Space Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) shares, which had a nice turnaround in 2016 was one of the high-fliers along with graphics chips maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Compared to AMD's 295-percent gain in 2016, Nvidia added 223 percent. Source: Y Charts Following the release of first-quarter results on May 1, AMD plunged roughly by 24 percent and wallowed around the $10.5 levels. The shares have staged a small recovery in the recent two sessions, although remaining off the pre-earnings level. Nvidia also saw weakness immediately after AMD's results, dropping around 3.5 percent to a low of $102.77 from a pre-AMD earnings high of $106.64. However, come D-Day, strong results reported by Nvidia sent its stock soaring on May 10. It rose further on May 11 and is now perched at an all-time high. Source: Y Charts United Steel's Brittleness United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), which was already struggling due to fundamental and company-specific concerns, saw the wind taken out its sails following the release of its first-quarter results on April 25. The company reported below-consensus first-quarter results, in fact reporting an unexpected quarterly loss. The company also significantly lowered its 2017 guidance. The stock lost a whopping 27 percent in reaction to the results and has not found its footing ever since, as negative headlines continue to come in, the latest being the pricing risk for its flat-rolled segment. Following first-quarter results out April 20, shares of peer Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) were broadly flat lining. Nucor did see a sympathy move on April 26, with a gap opening lower by about 2.5 percent. However, Nucor managed to wipe away the loss and end up 1.7 percent at $62 on the same day. Since then, the stock has been off color and is now down 5.4 percent from April 25. Source: Y Charts There is no denying of the fact that stocks are reciprocal, and these correlations are unstable. Since a stock move is a function of several factors, there cannot be a strict conclusion on the kind of correlation that exists. A wary investor would watch out for the several factors in play before making any investment decisions. Joel Elconin contributed to this article.

2017-05-23,Steel Stocks Outperform Ahead Of Wednesday's Commerce Department Hearing,"Steel stocks were up big on Tuesday ahead of the Department of Commerce hearing on the Section 232 probe. The DoC is set to come out with more details regarding the impact steel imports has on U.S. national security. Stock Movements United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X): Up 5.27 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS): Up 9.55 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Up 3.54 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD): Up 4.08 percent. Worthington Industries, Inc. (NYSE:WOR): Up 3.29 percent. A Jefferies research analyst suggested a high probability of the DoC institutes more incremental trade defense measures but noted most of the investigation remains unknown going into Wednesday. The report noted investors should expect “to garner a better understanding of the true breadth of the investigation with presenters likely to include domestic-international mills, industry groups, in addition to consumers/processors.” Ultimately, trade lawyers believe the hearing will offer steelmakers an opportunity to share what regulations they would like to see. Lawyers believe the final measures from this probe could involve tariffs, volume restrictions, quotas or license fees. The current administration is looking for a win, and signs are currently leaning towards a positive outcome according to the Jeffries report. Here’s what investors know so far: The DoC is taking a holistic view of “national security” This means they are looking at production/capacity, employment loss, displacement of domestic products by imports, etc. Secretary Wilbur Ross had indicated he is aiming for broad measures He has criticized antidumping/countervailing measures by calling them “porous” and stating that the measures could have more potential Section 232 is viewed as a probe that is meant to help steelmakers while also not permanently impacting other trade methods according to the Jefferies report How Has The Probe Impacted Buyer Behavior? Many participants expect the Trump administration to enact broader measures and have adjusted their buying patterns. Some foreign mills have already told “domestic buyers” they would be forced to pay the potential tariffs which has led to some cancellations. The DoC has 270 days to complete its investigation, but Ross has noted that the investigation could be finished by the middle of June. The hearing begins at 10:00 a.m. ET tomorrow.

2017-05-24,Section 232 Public Hearing Wednesday Is 'Unlikely To Affect Steel Equities',"The Department of Commerce (DOC) is set to hold the Section 232 Hearing at 10 a.m. ET. The meeting, which was extended due to unexpectedly high demand” from individuals wishing to speak, is unlikely to affect steel equities according to Alexander Hacking, an equities research analyst at Citi. However, it's interesting to note steel stocks did outperform on Tuesday and in Wednesday’s pre-market session. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) is up 2.06 percent in the pre-market. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) up 1.15 percent in the pre-market. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) up 1.21 percent in the pre-market. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD) up 1.33 percent in the pre-market. Hacking expects the meeting to provide individuals a chance to offer their arguments and commentary on the impact steel imports has on U.S. national security. It also provides the DOC a chance see the amount of pushback from steel consumers. He expects there will be some sort of action announced by Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. However, it's difficult to determine what impact this will have on steel equities, Hacking said. Steel equities have lost value since President Donald Trump’s win in November, but this meeting potentially could provide them with an upside. Thomas Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, told the NASDAQ, The probe could result in broader protections that solve a whack-a-mole problem of shutting out unfairly traded imports from China or India only to see shipments increase from elsewhere or transshipped through third countries.” The hearing will be live-streamed starting at 10 a.m., according to the DOC website."
2017-05-24,"Steel Analyst Says The Market's Become Too Bearish On China, Upgrades Entire Sector","Credit Suisse analyst Curt Woodworth upgraded the U.S. steel sector from Market Weight to Overweight, citing an overly bearish view of Chinese hot rolled coil and the pending results of the Department of Commerce’s investigation into the industry. The analyst also upgraded United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) from Neutral to Outperform. A Look At Chinese Steel The analyst reiterated his forecast that hot rolled coil (HRC) will bottom out this summer at $580 per ton, noting that Chinese HRC prices are reverting to normalized levels, but now expects prices to recover in Q3. Rebar prices are also at multi-year highs. This data along with solid demand lead Woodworth to believe “the market has become too bearish on China.” See Also: Section 232 Public Hearing Wednesday Is 'Unlikely To Affect Steel Equities' Section 232 The Department of Commerce has been looking into the effects of steel imports on national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. “We believe the DoC will find some interrelationship between the health of the US steel industry and US national security, paving the way for [President Donald] Trump to implement additional layers of trade support for the industry,” said Woodworth. The analyst believes the market is underestimating changes in foreign producer behavior for five reasons: Presidential executive orders in support of steel.

2017-05-31,Nucor: The Best Shining U.S. Steel Stock,"Recent History of Steel Stocks The U.S. steel industry has been in a downtrend since the 2008 global recession due, in large part, to China's dumping of cheap steal into the market. The chart below illustrates just how much the imbalance of China's imports and exports of steel has widened since 2009. Source: Steel Industry Executive Summary: May 2017 This supply and demand imbalance has pushed steel prices lower which has weighed heavily on producers such as U.S. Steel Corp (NYSE:X), Nucor (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ:STLD). However, sentiment for this sluggish industry changed following the election of President Donald Trump and his “America First” focus. What Makes Steel Stocks Shine Now? Just last month, President Trump ordered a probe of foreign steel’s impact on U.S. security. The potential outcomes of this Section 232 investigation could be additional tariffs and (or) limiting imports of foreign made steel. This could help inflate U.S. steel prices which would ultimately help U.S. steel manufactures. Global demand also appears to be on the uptrend. The World Steel Association reported in April that the global steel capacity utilization is up by 26%, its highest level in nearly two and half years. More recently on May 24th, Credit Suisse upgraded the entire steel sector highlighting that its channel checks with U.S. traders and OEMs indicate that a structural change is taking place with respect to U.S. trade… which the market is underestimating. Tailwinds appear to be building in the U.S. steel market. Why Nucor? Nucor Corporation is an American steel and related products producer. It is the largest steel producer in the U.S. and also the largest minimill steelmaker. The use of minimills in steel manufacturing rather than traditional methods of melting the scrap steel adds more value to Nucor when compared with traditional manufacturers such as U.S. Steel Corp and AK Steel (NYSE:AKS). Minimills are already experiencing a comeback and have been a bright spot in the industry. Bradford Research recently highlighted that profits for minimills are up 50% to 100% compared to this time a year ago. In addition, Nucor is a well diversified and well positioned U.S. steel company. Over the last several years, the company focused on expanding its business in new areas such as Canada and Mexico to help combat geographic specific downturns. These precautionary actions should pave the way for tremendous growth going forward in addition to any potential comeback in the U.S. steel market. The company's 2016 EBITDA and EBITDA margin of $2,116 and 13.1%, respectively, reached a level not seen since 2008. Furthermore, the company's unique profit sharing price structure helped Nucor stay profitable though the steel industry's downturn as shown below. Nucor summary financials source. Nucor’s profit and returns are also well above its industry peers and the materials sector as a whole as illustrated below. Peers include: X, CMC, AKS, WOR, RS, AP and HNH. Nucor peer chart source. Nucor's Quality Margin Of Safety Nucor shares also look attractive on a fundamental cash flow basis. When applying Wall Street projections to eleven separate valuation analyses, finbox.io calculates an intrinsic value estimate of $62.75 that implies 8% upside. View all 11 valuation models that derive NUE's fair value estimate. Nucor is a diversified, high-quality business with a consistent track record and looks to be trading at a discount. A potential increase in global demand coupled with President Trump's trillion dollar investment plan and section 232 investigation provide additional upside for Nucor shareholders. Value investors may want to take a closer look at this shining steel stock."

2017-06-16,"Nucor's Q2 Guidance Falls Short of Estimates, Shares Drop","Nucor Corporation NUE has provided its guidance for the second quarter of 2017. The steel giant expects earnings for the quarter in the band of $1.00–$1.05 per share. This is a decrease from $1.11 per share recorded in the previous quarter, but an increase from 76 cents a share it earned a year ago.The company's guidance for the quarter fell short of expectations. Analysts polled by Zacks currently expect earnings of $1.26 a share, on an average, for the quarter.The Charlotte-based company's shares fell around 7.6%, to close at $54.60 yesterday.Nucor said that the expected decrease in second-quarter performance on sequential basis is due to decreased performance of the steel mills segment, especially bar mills and sheet mills. The market condition for hot rolled steel products is also facing challenges due to aggressive competition. However, the company expects the profitability of plate mills to improve in second quarter of 2017.The company expects the performance of its downstream products segment to improve in the second quarter as compared with the first, but to decrease from the prior-year quarter.Nucor sees an overall positive trend in non-residential construction markets. The company expects performance of raw materials segment to improve in second quarter of 2017 on sequential basis due to profitable performance of direct reduced iron facilities.Nucor noted that the U.S. steel industry continues to be adversely affected by cheaper imports, which account for about 26% market share. Finished steel imports from foreign producers have increased about 14% year over year during the first five months of 2017. However, several ongoing and completed cases are slowing down the flood of subsidized steel products from foreign producers. Nucor also appreciated the government's initiative to restrict unfairly traded imports by imposing antidumping and countervailing duties, including Japan and Turkey.Nucor's shares fell 15.6% in the last three months, marginally outperforming the Zacks categorized Steel-Producers industry's decline of 16.6%. Nucor remains committed to expand its production capabilities. The company is investing an estimated $230 million to add an additional cold mill at its Nucor Steel Arkansas division. The additional cold mill (start-up expected in 2018) will give Nucor the capability to make new products.Nucor has also been focusing on growth through strategic acquisitions and is well positioned to gain from such efforts to expand business through mergers and acquisitions. Nucor, in early 2017, wrapped up its purchase of steel electrical conduit maker, Republic Conduit, from Luxembourg-based Tenaris S.A. for $335 million. The acquisition positioned Nucor as the market leader in steel conduits. Moreover, the company acquired Southland Tube for $130 million in Jan 2017. The buyout has strengthened Nucor's foothold in the hollow structural section (HSS) steel tubing segment.However, the steel industry is still under pressure owing to years of excess steel-making. Unfairly-traded, subsidized imports are still flowing into the American market due to foreign producers' overcapacity.

2017-07-11,"Citi Previews Steel Sector Earnings, Says US Steel May Outperform","With second-quarter North American steel earnings just around the corner, Citigroup analyst Alexander Hacking recently provided investors with a brief preview of what they should expect. While Citi isn’t anticipating industry-wide strength for steel stocks, Hacking said United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) could be a standout performer. U.S. Steel’s first-quarter results were weighed down by seasonable weakness and one-time charges that should have no impact on its Q2 results. U.S. Steel will also likely provide more details about its ongoing asset revitalization initiative, which Hacking said could be a positive for the stock. But while U.S. Steel could be on the upswing after it reports, Citi expects AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) earnings to decline in Q2, as higher maintenance and raw materials costs will weigh on the company’s bottom line. Iron ore and coking coal prices could also offset positive demand impacts for Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Hacking wrote. He said risk/reward is currently balanced for both stocks. A wildcard in the steel industry at the moment is President Donald Trump’s Section 232 investigation into steel and aluminum imports. However, Hacking cautioned investors about making assumptions about the impact of the investigation. “Section 232 could generate upside, but we are cautious about overpaying for this trade, which may have limited duration,” he wrote. Related Link: Catalysts On The Horizon For Metals & Mining Group; Deutsche Bank Upgrades, US Steel, AK Steel To Buy In June, Deutsche Bank upgraded U.S. Steel and AK Steel to Buy on expectations that Section 232 will help underlying U.S. steel demand and potentially limit imports.

2017-07-18,Morgan Stanley: Now Is The Time To Forge A Position In US Steel Names,"Wall Street got even more bullish on steel stocks on Tuesday when Morgan Stanley analyst Evan Kurtz recommended traders take the opportunity to buy a handful a steel stocks ahead of earnings season. Kurtz’s bullish note came after Morgan Stanley analysts met with steel and scrap buyers, traders and processors last week to discuss the outlook for the industry. According to Kurtz, U.S. steel prices will likely be on the rise in the second half of the year. “The key takeaways were that imports are likely to dip significantly in September/October since traders don’t want to take the risk of being an ‘importer of record’ with the threat of Section 232 penalties,” Kurtz wrote. Related Link: Citi Previews Steel Sector Earnings, Says US Steel May Outperform President Trump has ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, the groundwork for him potentially using his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. In light of the potential upcoming catalyst for domestic steel, Morgan Stanley has raised its forecast for hot rolled steel by about $55/st to around $625/st. Looking ahead to earnings season, Kurtz expects traders will be watching United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) closest since they haven’t provided updated Q2 guidance recently. For U.S. Steel, the critical issue will be whether or not Q1 headwinds carried over into the second quarter. For AK Steel, investors will be watching to see whether or not the company’s second have auto forecasts are adjusted to account for end-market weakness.

2017-07-27,"Trump Comments On Trade Caused This Analyst To Downgrade AK Steel, US Steel","United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) shares jumped 7.2 percent on Wednesday after the company’s second-quarter earnings topped Wall Street’s expectations. However, comments from President Donald Trump about his ongoing investigation into U.S. steel imports this week may have taken the wind out of U.S. Steel’s sails, according to Longbow Research analyst Chris Olin. On Thursday, Olin downgraded U.S. Steel and rival AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) from Buy to Neutral after Trump said potential restrictions on U.S. steel imports under his Section 232 authority would be put on the backburner for now while Republicans focus on higher-priority issues such as healthcare and tax reform. Olin now sees only a 50 percent probability of a positive outcome from Trump’s investigation, down from a 70 percent chance just a month ago. “The uncertainty on the Trump Administration steel import policy was reflected in modestly slower steel activity,” Olin wrote. “Over the past few days, industry contacts suggested the channel returned to ‘business as usual,’ with customer orders and price expectations turning flattish.” Related Link: What Moves US Steel Shares More, Earnings Or Trump Talk On Trade? With U.S. Steel already up 19 percent in the past month, Olin sees little room for upside unless Trump can provide a meaningful boost to domestic steel prices. In the meantime, Longbow suggests investors focus on mini-mill names, such as Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). Olin likes these two companies’ exposure to nonresidential construction, lower HRC cost structures, relative insulation from the auto industry and their strong balance sheets. Longbow maintains Buy ratings on both stocks with a $66 price target for Nucor and a $40 price target for Steel Dynamics. ______ Image Credit: By Jim Mattis - 170720-D-SV709-006, Public Domain, via Wikimedia Commons"

2017-09-05,"Predicting A Price Surge, Bank Of America Upgrades U.S. Steel","U.S. steel stocks have lagged the market so far in 2017, but the groundwork may be set for a strong finish to 2017. On Tuesday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners upgraded United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) to Buy and said steel prices are headed higher in the second half of the year. According to Tanners, reduction in Chinese production coupled with elevated demand will offset any pricing pressures that result from a disappointing resolution to the Section 232 investigation in the United States. After opening the investigation into steel imports earlier this year, President Trump recently said that a final decision on potential restrictions is not a priority for the administration at the moment. “We’re waiting till we get everything finished up between health care and taxes and maybe even infrastructure,” Trump said in July. Related Link: Morgan Stanley: Now Is The Time To Forge A Position In US Steel Names Tanners said some degree of trade protection should be possible for U.S. steel producers, even if it’s not as much as investors had initially hoped. Hurricane Harvey rebuilding could also provide a bit of a demand boost in the U.S., but Tanners said hurricanes have historically not moved the needle much. Bank of America has raised its year-end price forecast for hot rolled coil steel by about 5 percent to $700/st. “We think a rising steel price is not fully anticipated by steel buyers, with many holding off purchases, or investors, with the group underowned and still recovering from its wounds after Section 232 so far has disappointed,” Tanners wrote. In addition to the new Buy rating and $31 price target for U.S. Steel, Bank of America has Buy ratings on the following domestic steel stocks as well: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) ($9 price target) Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) ($73 price target) Steel Dynamics, Inc.

2017-09-15,Did Hurricanes Bend Steel Stocks' Strength This September?,"U.S. steel investors will be watching closely next week as two bellwethers for the domestic steel business are expected to release Q3 guidance. Jefferies analyst Seth Rosenfeld says Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) will likely disappoint Wall Street by guiding for Q3 EPS of around 80 cents, while Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) will come closer to consensus estimates by guiding for EPS of 65 cents. Update: On Friday morning, Nucor said it sees Q3 GAAP of 75 cents-80 cents, which doesn't compare to $1.02 estimates. Prior to hurricanes Harvey and Irma, the U.S. steel industry was demonstrating surprising seasonal strength in the third quarter. Through early September, weekly U.S. production was up 4 percent year-over-year and up 1 percent compared to Q2. However, Rosenfeld says Harvey and Irma likely had a negative impact on the Q3 production and shipments of Nucor, Steel Dynamics and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC), all of which operate in the South. “Both NUE/STLD 3Q17 guidance expected next week may come below sell-side expectations, but likely match already cautious buy-side, with downside risks from recent hurricanes unknown,” Rosenfeld wrote. Despite headwinds from the hurricanes, the potential for an expanding metal spread into Q4 makes any guidance-related sell-off a buying opportunity next week. Jefferies anticipates United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) to maintain its previous full-year 2017 EBITDA guidance of $1.1 billion. Jefferies estimates Q3 U.S. HRC prices to average $626/ton, up $10 from Q2. Iron ore prices are also expected to jump $10 to $73/ton. HRC spreads are expected to decrease by $6 per ton to $262.

Rating/Price Target Nucor: Downgraded to Neutral/Price target lowered from $62 to $56–$58. Steel Dynamics: Downgraded to Neutral/PT lowered from $40 to $35–$36. AK Steel: Maintained at Neutral. United States Steel: Maintained at Neutral. In Pre-Market Trading Monday Nucor was slipping 1.28 percent to $55.32. Steel Dynamics shares were losing 1.91 percent to $33.81. AKS Steel was adding 0.18 percent to $5.59. United States Steel was off 0.23 percent to $25.60. Demand, Pricing Weakness Analyst Chris Olin said he is cutting his fourth-quarter and 2018 earnings per share estimates for the entire steel coverage group, attributing the action to the incremental demand weakness evident in its latest carbon steel channel checks. The analyst noted that order activity slowed notably since the summer months, and industry contacts recently lowered the near-term pricing expectations on Hot Rolled Coil despite limited import availability. Accordingly, the firm noted that the year-end pricing forecast for HRC is down at $580–$590 per ton after holding in the $640 range for most of the summer months. See also: Did Hurricanes Bend Steel Stocks' Strength This September? Dissecting The Demand Weakness Giving anecdotes of demand weakness, Longbow Research said downstream volume growth fell 1–2 percent year over year, a reversal from the 2–3-percent positive comps performance in the second quarter. Additionally, the firm said 11 of the 15 individually-tracked end-markets are showing unfavorable comps versus the last quarter. The firm also noted that service inventories are balanced on the long product side but sheet distributors are aiming to cut holdings. Finally, the firm said speculation that hedge-buying created 2 million–3 million tons of excess invisible inventory is abounding, with about 20 percent of companies saying third-quarter volumes were coming in below plan. Supply-Side Dynamics On the supply-side, the firm noted there are very few lower prices imports, with 65 percent of sheet buyers seeing a pullback in foreign availability. The surveys also showed that 45 percent of contacts are sourcing imports, down from the normal 60-70 percent acceptance rate, the firm said. Also, the firm projects import market share loss over the next three to four months. Pricing Longbow Research noted that distributors have started to cut the near-term spot price expectations, which is down $40–$50 per ton from the estimate in late summer. The firm expects the excess scrap supply to pressure raw material prices in October/November. While noting that the past mill price increase attempts did not stick, the firm said the current quote for HRC is $610–$620 per ton, down $10–$20 per ton from the August level. Quoting the survey, the firm said, I think most people have gotten over their fears of supply drying up and that is why pricing has started to fall. All of the distributors we talk to really have no major concerns about the looming 232. Demand has definitely slowed. Fully Neutral The firm said it is now Fully Neutral on its steel coverage group, with 2017 and 2018 estimates at or below consensus estimates. The firm noted that downstream steel volumes are coming in below plan and most distributors are looking to liquidate inventories. While there has been investor speculation about potential benefits [associated] with cutbacks in global supply (and focus on Chinese reform), this impact is not evident within channel check data or distributor sentiment, the firm said.

2017-10-13,12 Stocks Moving Following China Import News,"Shares of American and other international-based companies who export metals and other commodities were mostly trading higher on Friday after China reported its total imports for the month of September had risen by 18.7 percent, Bloomberg reported. The improvement in imports is impressive, Tao Dong, vice chairman for Greater China at Credit Suisse in Hong Kong told Bloomberg. This seems to be a reflection of a modest picking up in China's growth led by the commodities and machinery sectors, on top of a robust IT industry. The economy is improving.

2017-10-18,Gordon Johnson Calls ArcelorMittal Out On Steel Price 'Manipulation',"When it comes to steel, traders know product price movement correlates with stock price movement. Steel mills know it, too. According to Axiom’s Gordon Johnson, this understanding drove ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE:MT) to announce a $40- to $50-ton price increase. “These guys announce price hikes when there’s either real demand or things are very weak and they’re trying to stop prices from falling further,” Johnson told Benzinga. “I think in this case it’s the latter.” The timing is certainly suspect. By Johnson’s analysis, demand is weak, iron ore is down, scrap is down and falling, and inventories are high based on winter demand. A price surge “doesn’t make sense.” “I don’t see how these guys haven’t been accused of price manipulation,” he said. Industry To Follow? But the poor state of demand won’t deter competitors from following suit. Johnson said the ArcelorMittal announcement will prompt similar hikes at United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF). The mere expectation for peers to imitate ArcelorMittal's price increases inspired a pop across industry stocks, Johnson said. But the spike will only last as long as investors assume strong demand, which Johnson said doesn't exist. He expects a cursory investigation into demand to diminish the market's support of steel. “This [announcement] will maybe delay the price decline by a week, but if there is no demand, prices will continue falling,” he said. “We believe demand is weak.” The analyst expects “bad” earnings reports — although not necessarily misses — from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Cliffs this week, which could reverse Wednesday’s trends.

2017-10-19,Steel Dynamics: The Steel Sector Pace Car For Q3 Earnings,"Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reported in-line earnings Wednesday, but Axiom’s Gordon Johnson expects a Thursday sell-off on weak guidance. Management announced fourth-quarter outlook for earnings before interest and taxes below Street expectations and cited “maintenance” for the anticipated miss (see Johnson's track record here). Johnson interpreted waning confidence as confirmation of lacking steel demand. “Why take maintenance if demand is robust?” he told Benzinga. This assessment — coupled with drops in iron ore and steel prices, high seasonal inventory, declines in U.S. construction spending and cuts to auto production — reinforced his negative industry sentiment. In a Thursday note, Johnson lowered Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) estimates ahead of Friday earnings and predicted a miss and cut to full-year guidance. He expects third-quarter revenue of $632 million and earnings per share of 24 cents against Street expectations of $676 million and 32 cents. The steel industry will wrap up its reports with: Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) on Oct. 19. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) on Oct. 26. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) on Oct. 31. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) on Oct. 31. ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE:MT) on Nov. 11. Heading into the season, the Street appears ambivalent on industry players, with TipRanks reporting a general balance of ratings. As of Thursday, analysts had three Buys, three Holds and two Sells on Cliffs.

2017-10-31,6 Stocks Dragged Down By AK Steel's Disappointing Q3 Report,"Shares of AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) fell more than 12 percent Tuesday morning after the company's third-quarter earnings report came in short of expectations. AK Steel reported a GAAP earnings per share loss of 2 cents on revenue of $1.49 billion. Wall Street analysts were expecting the company to earn 4 cents per share on revenue of $1.52 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter fell from $156.6 million, or 10.8 percent of net sales, a year ago to $69.2 million, or 4.6 percent of net sales. Total flat-rolled steel shipments fell 2 percent from a year ago to 1.3686 million tons due to softer demand from the automotive market, the company said. Average selling price per flat-rolled steel ton did rise 2 percent from a year ago to $1,021 due to the higher average selling price on contract and spot market sales and higher surcharges on specialty steels. Our financial results for the third quarter are in line with the guidance we provided in July. We are particularly pleased to have completed the acquisition of Precision Partners during the quarter as we execute on our downstream strategy, said Roger K. Newport, CEO of AK Steel. Our ongoing efforts to strengthen our balance sheet continued during the quarter with the successful refinancing of our 2022 senior notes and extension of our credit facility. These actions position us well for the future. Steel Stocks Lower AK Steel's poor earnings report was felt across nearly the entire steel and commodity sector although to various degrees.

2018-01-16,"Steel Industry Assures Of Its Importance In Autos, Sustainable Client Base At NAIAS","Regulations might be restricting targeted automakers, but the steel industry considers itself a beneficiary of heightened expectations. “With the stringent requirements for occupant protection and increasing fuel efficiency requirements and tailpipe emission regulations, the deployment of technology is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, and steel is at the forefront,” Steel Market Development Institute President Tom Gibson said at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. “...Use of advanced high-strength steel has grown tremendously in the last 15 years as a result of the increase in demand for vehicle crashworthiness, mass reduction and cost effectiveness.” Gibson also sees steel positioned to capitalize on the auto industry’s itch to innovate. With 200 steel grades of varying properties, the material is seen to expand automakers’ design optionality and enable heightened safety, weight reduction and related improvements in safety, affordability, fuel economy, emissions and recyclability. “What this means to the consumer is the cost of ownership, including purchase price, insurance and repair, are lower for steel-intensive vehicles than vehicles that are lightweighted with alternate materials,” Jody Hall, vice president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, said. Cross-Industry Collaborations Considering this client opportunity, the SMDI, whose investors include AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE:MT), collaborates with automotive companies to deliver lightweight steel solutions. Partners include Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), where the likes of ArcelorMittal embed resident engineers to foster coengineering and ensure “win-win” solutions for both industries. Finding Steel On The NAIAS Show Floor Steel executives claim their value is evident in current end products. Blake Zuidema, director of automotive product applications division at ArcelorMittal, said the strength of the steel industry is seen in this year’s new vehicle models, including the Chevrolet Bolt and Ram 1500. “Not only are these vehicles steel intensive vehicles but they showcase how carmakers are making innovative use in the latest of steel technology for car bodies,” Zuidema said, noting that different steel grades are used for different vehicle parts. “We’re now designing unique grades of steel for virtually every individual part of the car.” Related Links: NAIAS 2018: VW Works To Earn Back Trust; Toyota, Ram Introduce New Models Honda, Volvo, Lincoln Win Vehicle Of The Year Awards At NAIAS"

2018-02-12,KeyBanc Projects 17% Upside In Timkensteel Corp. Shares,"Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST) shares have pulled back about 26 percent since their Jan. 23 high, in contrast to a more modest 8-percent drop by the S&P 500 Index, prompting KeyBanc Capital Markets to upgrade the stock. The Analyst Analyst Philip Gibbs upgraded shares of Timkensteel from Sector Weight from Overweight with a $17 price target, suggesting about 17-percent upside from current levels. The Thesis An attractive valuation after the recent sell-off, modest incremental improvement in industry spot pricing and the emergence of a stronger free cash flow estimate were the drivers of the upgrade, Gibbs said in a Sunday note. The firm's 2018 HRC pricing estimate is now up from $655 per ton to $670 per ton, while the CRC view is maintained at $825 per ton, lowering the HRC-to-CRC spread to $155 per ton compared to $190 per ton in 2017, according to KeyBanc. The spread is now easing closer to the trailing 10-year average of $120 per ton, Gibbs said. The normalization is a function of positive HRC standard deviation and less relative tightness in downstream products amid new capacity and import persistence, the analyst said. We believe spot HRC mill spreads will grow strongly in 2018, while downstream products will be more muted, Gibbs said. KeyBanc modestly increased its estimates for Timkensteel, citing an improving U.S. SBQ, or special bar quality, pricing and mix backdrop. The firm sees Timkensteel and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) to be more affected relative to Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) if the Trump administration's infrastructure narrative becomes dragged or disappoints, Gibbs said. The Price Action Over the past year, Timkensteel shares are down about 13 percent, with a year-to-date drop of about 4 percent.

2018-02-12,Trump's Infrastructure Plan: What You Should Know,"President Donald Trump unveiled a much-anticipated, $1.5-trillion infrastructure plan intended to “address unmet rural infrastructure needs, empower state and local authorities and train the American workforce of the future, according to the White House. The Plan The infrastructure plan aims to address traditional infrastructure such as roads, bridges and airports, as well as water resources, rural infrastructure and energy in order to promote economic growth. “The reforms set out by my plan will strengthen the economy, make our country more competitive, reduce the costs of goods and services for American families, and enable Americans to build their lives on top of the best infrastructure in the world, Trump said in the announcement. One aspect of the plan is an infrastructure incentives program designed to “encourage increased state, local and private investment in infrastructure.” The administration plans to commit $100 billion to the program, aiming to stimulate spending at the state and local level. States and counties with infrastructure spending plans would be eligible to apply and receive partial funding through the program. Some are concerned that this will shift a heavy portion of the financial burden to state and local governments. What Analysts Are Saying Analysts at Height Securities were skeptical about the passing of the plan in its current form, maintaining 15-percent odds that Congress would OK infrastructure legislation. “The $200 billion in federal spending is expected to be offset by equal cuts to non-defense discretionary spending — a non-starter with most if not all Democrats, Height Securities said. Iinfrastructure legislation will require 60 Senate votes to pass, while Republicans hold 51 seats, leading Height analysts to be “highly skeptical” that the plan will garner the necessary support to pass. Stocks To Watch For While it remains unclear whether new infrastructure legislation will be passed, investors should keep an eye out for stocks that could stand to benefit from an infrastructure package. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (CBOE: PAVE), which is made up of 89 U.S. stocks, has already experienced upside from infrastructure projects in New York, California and Charlotte, North Carolina. Steel producer Nucor (NYSE:NUE) could benefit from the bridge and railroad efforts outlined in the plan. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a leader in construction machinery and offers a diverse portfolio of products that could be used in infrastructure and construction efforts.

2018-02-14,"Analyst: Steel Investors Need Action From Trump, Not Words","President Trump on Tuesday said he is considering a number of options for actions he could take to improve the struggling U.S. steel market, including imposing tariffs or quotas on imported steel. Trump said the U.S. steel industry is getting “decimated by dumping” of foreign steel into the market. I look at it two ways: I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry, and we do need that for national defense, Trump said. Trump has ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, the groundwork for him potentially using his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. In January, Trump made a similar decision to implement a 30 percent tariff on imported solar panels. Height Securities said on Wednesday that, despite Trump’s tough language, investors shouldn’t expect immediate action. Height said the potential for negative economic fallout from steel tariffs or alienation of key U.S. allies are two factors holding back the White House from making a move. “We expect that yesterday's meeting was intended primarily as a messaging tool by the White House and that the President's remarks, much like his threat of a ‘reciprocal tax’ from Monday, represents a return to campaign-style rhetoric rather than a clear indicator of immediate action,” Height said in a note. If Height is correct, the gains in steel stocks on Wednesday morning may be unwarranted, at least at this point: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 2.2 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) up 1.3 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) up 2.5 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) up 0.8 percent.

2018-02-16,"US Steel, Aluminum Stocks Rally After Commerce Dept. Calls For Tariffs","Steel and aluminum stocks moved sharply higher Friday after the U.S. Commerce Department issued a recommendation to President Donald Trump to enact steep tariffs or quotas on foreign companies. What You Need To Know Trump's administration looked into the topic of steel and aluminum imports and any potential impact on natural security, CNBC reported. Steel imports are weakening our internal economy and pose a threat to national security, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a Friday letter. Ross recommends the White House take immediate action by adjusting the level of imports through quotas or tariffs. Why It's Important The report calls for a global tariff of 24 percent on all steel imports, with another option calling for a tariff of at least 53 percent on steel coming from a dozen countries including Brazil and China, CNBC said. Ross recommended a 63-percent quota of the countries' 2017 imports. The report also calls for a 7.7-percent tariff on all imported aluminum for most countries, but a higher rate of 23.5 percent on aluminum products from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam. A higher quota of 86.7 percent was recommended in the aluminum report. What's Next? The White House would be able to exempt certain countries from a tariff or quota, and individual companies can seek an appeal if they have any U.S. production facilities. U.S. steel producers should be able to operate at 80-percent average capacity utilization rates or better based on the available capacity that existed in 2017 if action is taken against foreign companies, Ross said. Stock Reactions AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) gained more than 12 percent. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) gained more than 10 percent and hit a new 52-week high of $43.97. Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ:CENX) gained 8 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) gained 4 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) gained 4 percent. Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) gained 0.6 percent.

2018-02-20,Analysts Break Down The Sec. 232 Steel Investigation,"U.S. steel stocks are surging after the U.S. Commerce Department recommended that President Donald Trump enact a 24-percent tariff on all steel imports. Trump had ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, laying the groundwork for him to potentially use his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. The Commerce Dept. laid out three possible courses of action for the president: A blanket 24-percent tariff on all countries. A 50-percent tariff on the 12 largest U.S. importers and a quota equal to 100 percent of 2017 imports on all other countries. No tariff and a quota of 63 percent of 2017 imports on all countries. Investors clearly see the announcement as good news for domestic steel stocks. Here’s what analysts had to say. Voices From The Street Trump will likely opt for a tariff-and-quota scenario, said Morgan Stanley analyst Piyush Sood. “We think that the tariff-plus-quota scenario, with [a] 53-percent tariff against [the] selected 12 countries and [a] quota set to 100-percent (of 2017 import levels) is most likely to be adopted, the analyst said in a Monday note. Citigroup analyst Alexander Hacking said any of the three potential proposals the Commerce Dept. suggested would generate a significant tailwind for the domestic steel industry. “Prices would rise sharply, likely $150/ton, with [the] potential for shortages in the quota-limit scenarios,” Hacking said. Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen said the potential tariffs will be short-lived and may actually be designed to use as leverage in negotiations with exporting countries. “We still see significant problems with the structure of the Section 232 process and anticipate pushback from the Defense Dept. and other factions within the administration, which may hamper efforts to accelerate this process,” Allen said. Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Terry said quotas would have more immediate impact than tariffs. “Quotas on all countries will likely have the maximum impact as it would immediately support higher domestic utilization,” Terry said. BMO Capital Markets analyst David Gagliano said the major impact of the recommendation is that U.S. steel imports will likely drop. “We believe this will result in higher U.S. production, higher U.S. prices and lower unit costs,” he said. Credit Suisse analyst Curt Woodworth said Trump has plenty of motivation to act at this point. “In our view the president will likely follow through on some of these recommendations, given pressure from steel industry executives and the win it would serve up for his political base,” the analyst said. Price Action Here’s a rundown of how steel stocks are reacting to the news since Friday: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) is up 18.1 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) is up 12.9 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) is up 6.1 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is up 4.4 percent.

2018-03-01,"Height Securities: Concrete Proposal Unlikely To Emerge From Trump's Tariff Meeting With Steel, Aluminum Execs","President Donald Trump will meet with steel and aluminum executives Thursday, leading some to speculate an import tariff announcement is imminent, according to Reuters. But Height Securities considers a final proposal on rates or quotas unlikely to be released. “We expect that ongoing opposition from foreign partners, Congressional leaders, industry representatives from manufacturing industries and the Defense Department will push any final proposal further into March,” Height analysts said in a Thursday note. “ ... If we do receive any announcement today, it will likely be short on detail and may ignore aluminum altogether, as we understand the DoD has significant concerns with imposing any restrictions on aluminum imports.” More likely: a reiteration of Trump’s commitment to strong action, according to Height. Trump tweeted about the topic Thursday morning: Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2018 Headlines from the meeting are expected to bolster sentiment around the steel industry — but not necessarily around the U.S. economy. RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas said tariff talk should not be considered positive. The imposition of tariffs on steel & aluminum is not just bad policy but the worst form of crony capitalism. This will lead to higher consumer costs on autos & transportation.

2018-03-01,"Trump's Comments On Steel, Aluminum Tariffs Shake The Markets","Steel and aluminum stocks are popping on Thursday while the rest of the market crashes after President Donald Trump said he will be announcing new steel and aluminum tariffs as early as next week. What You Need To Know Trump said Thursday the U.S. will implement a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports, but didn't specify whether the tariffs will be applied to all imports or just imports from specific countries. “People have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,” Trump said. “By people representing up who didn’t have a clue.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 500 points Thursday afternoon, sitting around the 24,500 level at time of publication. The S&P 500 slid about 43 points. Why It’s Important The new metal tariffs are on the high end of what some analysts expected after the U.S. Commerce Department recommended a 24-percent tariff earlier this month. Back in January, Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on imported panels, most of which are coming from Asia. China, which is the largest international U.S. trade partner, is a major importer of both steel and solar panels. Politicians in both the EU and China have already threatened to retaliate against the U.S. if Trump implements import tariffs. The EU has said it's prepared to act “swiftly and appropriately” to restrictive U.S. trade measures by potentially implementing its own restrictions on U.S. exports such as bourbon, cheese, orange juice tomatoes and potatoes. EU officials could also reportedly target iconic American brands, such as Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). China is also reportedly already prepping for a trade war, investigating the possibility of restricting U.S. grain imports. What’s Next Investors will now be watching and waiting for further details on the new tariffs and any indication the market sell-off could soften Trump’s stance. In the meantime, Height Securities said on Thursday the steel tariffs are great news for U.S. steel stocks, potentially providing support for domestic prices and increasing profitability. “It is possible that Trump could use this meeting to confirm his commitment to taking strong action, especially on steel tariffs, and we expect that headlines will be positive for the affected steel companies,” Height said prior to Trump's announcement. Here’s a rundown of how steel and aluminum stocks reacted to the news on Thursday: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 7.6 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) was up 4.2 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) was up 10.9 percent. Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) was up 1.7 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) was up 2.4 percent.

The Analyst Longbow Research analyst Chris Olin reiterated Buy ratings for the following four steel stocks and adjusted the price targets as follows: Protectionist policies were already baked into steel stock prices and earnings outlooks, but Trump’s decision to opt for a 25-percent tariff was more aggressive than the market was anticipating, Olin said in a Friday note. Despite a recent run-up in steel stocks, the latest news leaves room for further upside, the analyst said. “We still expect steel mills to benefit from rapid upward spot price movement throughout 2018 with a higher-than-expected floor in 2019,” Olin said. As a result, he said Wall Street earnings estimates will need to be adjusted much higher in the coming days. Longbow is valuing U.S. steel stocks using a long-term HRC price range of between $750 and $775/ton. However, Olin expects prices to range between $850 and $875 per ton by the second quarter. Olin made the following adjustments to his 2019 EPS projections: Nucor raised from $1.75 to $7.33. Steel Dynamics raised from $1.03 to $5. U.S. Steel raised from $2.15 to $7.27. AK Steel raised from 24 cents to $1.25. Price Action The prices of all four steel stocks surged between 3 and 10 percent Thursday following Trump’s announcement.

Korn said copper is the most attractive metal for Goldman at the moment, and Feeport McMoRan has the most copper exposure of the names mentioned. In addition, Korn said U.S. steel mills are expanding capacity with the support of new trade policy and aluminum demand is strong driven by a booming transportation industry.

2018-06-19,"BofA Downgrades Commercial Metals On Supply, Valuation Concerns","Since hitting a low of $19.65 on April 5, shares of Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) have gained about 23 percent, prompting Bank of America Merrill Lynch to revisit its rating on the equity. The Analyst Analyst Timna Tanners downgraded Commercial Metals from Neutral to Underperform and lowered the price target from $24 to $23. The Thesis Commercial Metals' valuation already reflects its much better-than-normal earnings power and its proposed plan to acquire four Gerdau U.S. rebar mills that's scheduled to close by the end of the year, Tanners said in a Tuesday note. (See the analyst's track record here.) On the downside, the analyst projects potential antitrust challenges to the Gerdau deal due to excess concentration, as imports now face a 25-percent Section 232 tariff, Tanners said. Taking into account the weakness of the Turkish lira — which is down 24 percent year-to-date — the price of imported rebar has dropped, resulting in a $125/ton discount to U.S. prices even after tariffs were applied, the analyst said. BofA expects U.S. rebar imports to rebound in Q4 after a summer dip, along with additional volume from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). The U.S. rebar market was oversupplied before the Trump administration's tariffs, Tanners said. Utilization remains below 80 percent, indicating limited pricing power, the analyst said. In recent midquarter updates on peers NUE and STLD we revisit valuation to use 'normal' multiples on conservative benchmark hot rolled coil and still find upside. BofA prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics to Commercial Metals. The Price Action Commercial Metals shares were down 3.86 percent at $23.15 at the time of publication Tuesday afternoon.

2018-07-24,Nucor Upgraded On U.S. Infrastructure Spending Prospects,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) traded higher Tuesday after one Street analyst gave the stock his vote of approval. The Analyst KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Philip Gibbs upgraded Nucor from Sector Weight to Overweight and and set a $77 price target. The Thesis Self-help growth initiatives in fabrication and raw materials will provide Nucor with more of an earnings boost in 2019 than previously anticipated, Gibbs said in the upgrade note. (See the analyst's track record here.) KeyBanc raised its 2018 EPS forecast from $4.68 to $5.40. “Further, company-specific drivers could add 20 percent to our EPS power view over time, while visible FCFE momentum [$3.3 billion from the second half of 2018 to 2019] and optionality to any nascent pickup in infrastructure spending provide further upside potential, the analyst said. Steel growth projects, stock buybacks and other drivers could push 2019 EPS as high as $6.50 and KeyBanc’s price target as high as $85, Gibbs said. KeyBanc is targeting 2019 steel prices of $675/ton for HRC. Nucor’s pristine balance sheet is only getting stronger, Gibbs said. Attention will slowly shift away from trade war uncertainty back to Nucor’s organic growth pipeline and a potential boost from U.S. infrastructure spending, in KeyBanc's view. The Trump administration’s top priority is the trade war, but that attention could soon shift to domestic infrastructure, Gibbs said; roughly half of Nucor’s demand comes from nonresidential construction spending. KeyBanc is predicting that Nucor will top consensus EPS and revenue expectations in the second quarter. Price Action Nucor shares were trading 2.68 percent higher at $68.51 at the time of publication Tuesday.

2018-07-27,"A Running List Of The Companies Blaming Trade Policy For Stifled Earnings, Guidance","The Trump administration's trade decisions seem to be the theme of the quarter. Of the first 146 S&P 500 companies to report second-quarter earnings, more than 40 percent mentioned tariffs on their conference calls, according to CNBC. While Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) celebrated the positive impact of trade policy on finished steel and ore, most corporations lamented the tariffs. Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS), for example, warned of “just how terrible” a tariff or trade war would be. Here's a roundup of companies that attributed poor earnings, weak guidance or headwind expectations to the Trump trade approach. General Motors General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) missed earnings-per-share estimates while beating sales forecasts. Management said rising steel and aluminum prices most significantly challenged margins and forced a guidance cut. “We were very much on track to delivering that 10-percent [margin] expectation until some of these commodity price impacts started to build as we got into the second quarter and as we extrapolate that throughout the year,” CFO Chuck Stevens said on a media call, noting an indirect impact through suppliers. “ ... At least as we think about 2018, the primary drivers are index commodities, and about 30 to 35 percent of our raw materials index, so as prices go up, that's an automatic pass-through.” Stevens said that, in GM’s model, tariffs aren’t expected to impact the U.S. auto industry this year. Yet non-tariff actions could trickle down. China’s devaluation of the renminbi, seen to be a direct response to U.S. trade policy, was cited by GM as suppressive to China results. Fiat Chrysler Citing similar trouble in China, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) reported a year-over-year decline in its bottom line despite improving sales and shipments. It also trimmed full-year sales guidance. “[We're] not overly concerned today, but we obviously need to keep an eye on commodity prices as we move into 2019,” CFO Richard Palmer said in a conference call. FCA is developing contingency plans to diminish the impact of tariffs. Ford Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) missed bottom-line estimates despite a revenue beat. Duties hurt the automaker’s China business, and CFO Bob Shanks said on an analyst call that tariffs, particularly those on steel and aluminum imports, should cost Ford $1.6 billion in North America this year. Notably, immediately after the trio reported earnings, Trump struck a deal with the European Union not to raise tariffs on cars or trucks. Stanley Black & Decker Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) reported sizable beats in its top- and bottom-lines but predicted steel, aluminum and Chinese import tariffs would create a $35-million headwind in 2018. We have initiated price increases for these implemented tariffs and look to further mitigate the remaining impact via the formal exclusion process where applicable,” CFO Donald Allan Jr. said on the earnings call. “ ... Prior to mitigating actions, we estimate the annual impact to be approximately $70 million to $80 million. Therefore, if you assume, and it is an assumption, a Sept. 1 implementation, the 2018 impact could be approximately $25 million. 3M 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) missed revenue forecasts and lowered the upper end of its full-year bottom-line guidance, but exceeded EPS expectations. CFO Nick Gangestad said tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese imports, although a “fairly immaterial impact,” will cost the company about $10 million on an annualized basis. On the price of raw materials, we are likely seeing that our commodity prices and the increases we're seeing — they're likely at a peak level, Gangestad said. Our selling price projections are consistent with that, and that's part of our anticipation that, in a more stable world going forward with commodities, we'll continue to have our selling prices more than offset what we're now seeing for commodity price increases. PPG Industries PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) not only posted in-line EPS and a sales beat but also raised its dividend. Nonetheless, it conceded a cost impact from commodity price increases. “In particular, we are closely monitoring our business in China for any possible impacts,” CEO Michael McGarry said on the earnings call. “Currently, the new tariffs are starting to add some modest cost to our raw materials.” Alcoa Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) similarly beat estimates, no thanks to the $15-million in tariff costs imposed on imports from its Canadian and other foreign processing operations. Management cut annual EBITDA expectations, citing a $12 million to $14 million monthly cost impact from aluminum tariffs. ConocoPhillips ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) beat bottom-line estimates and raised 2018 production guidance, but management said steel tariffs are becoming a “fairly significant” cost that will impact capital spending next year. Danaher Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) surpassed second-quarter expectations and raised full-year EPS guidance, but management factored in a slight headwind from tariffs. “There is no one business at Danaher that has a significant impact, but it's a bunch of little impact across all the businesses and that adds up to that roughly sort of 1-cent-a-quarter impact,” CFO Daniel Comas said on the earnings call. General Electric General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) beat top- and bottom-line estimates but intimated that, with 10 percent of its $29 billion in imports coming from China, and $7 billion in revenue dependent on China, its exposure to the trade war could eventually cause harm. We don't see a major impact yet financially, certainly not on our 2018 guidance, CEO John Flannery said in his earnings call. We have a massively global business in every sense, both with the customers, supply chains, everything. W.W. Grainger W W Grainger Inc (NYSE:GWW) beat estimates and raised projections, but anticipates trade-related cost increases. We expect that we will see some supplier inflation related to tariffs in the second half, and we are confident in our ability to pass on price increases,” CFO Thomas Okray said on the earnings call. Kimberly Clark Kimberly Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB) beat EPS forecasts while missing revenue estimates and slicing its annual bottom-line and net sales guidance. Management blamed $200 million in higher raw material costs. “When you have a commodity impact as large and as significant as it is right now, I think our customers understand that,” CFO Maria Henry told analysts. Intuitive Surgical Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) beat top- and bottom-line estimates, although management qualitatively guided for a tariff-related hit that the company will absorb. “We think that the estimated impact will be modest in terms of the increase in product cost for our systems,” CFO Marshall Mohr said on the call. “That's not a cost or a level that we're going to pass any of those costs on to customers at this point in time. Coca-Cola The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) beat estimates but, partially due to increased metal prices, said it is raising prices on sodas in North America and foresees bottlers and retailers passing the increases to consumers. Illinois Tool Works Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) achieved in-line EPS but missed sales estimates and issued full-year guidance below expectations. Management said tariffs represent between 10 percent and 15 percent of total projected cost inflation for 2018. Union Pacific Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) exceeded earnings estimates but acknowledged tariffs as a hindrance. “We have seen some very specific impacts on us, but they're pretty granular, right?” CEO Lance Fritz said on the earnings call. “Inbound on some rail that we buy from Japan, there was a substantial 25-percent tariff on the last boat that was received. And then we've seen some other discrete impacts on customers. Harley-Davidson Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) beat revenue and EPS estimates but lowered its full-year operating-margin projections from between 9.5 and 10.5 percent to between 9 percent and 10 percent. The first half of the year saw 14.4-percent margins. As a result of the recently enacted tariffs, we expect to incur approximately $45 million to $55 million of increased costs,” CFO John Olin said on an analyst call. “This includes incremental costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million for steel and aluminum, and approximately $30 million to $35 million for EU tariffs.” McDonald’s Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) beat estimates and reported a 4-percent comps increase, but CEO Steve Easterbrook suggested that “uncertainty of trade discussions” is contributing to negative consumer counts in China restaurants. Whirlpool Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) missed both top- and bottom-line estimates and cut guidance well below forecasts. Tariffs were seen to weigh on margins and inspire an increase in 2018 guidance for raw material costs from $300 million to $350 million. Global steel cost has risen substantially and, particularly in the U.S., they have reached unexplainable levels, CEO Marc Bitzer said during the firm's earnings call. ... Uncertainty related to tariffs and global trade actions have also led to increased costs for certain strategic components and finished goods imports and exports.” United Tech United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) reported beats across the board and even raised guidance, but it also reported higher costs attributable to tariffs. Tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese imports stifled the firm’s EPS guidance raise by 5 cents. Anticipating an increase in steel and aluminum tariffs, CEO Gregory Hayes said 2019 will see a “much bigger impact” as the firm books commodities six to nine months in advance.

2018-10-11,Seaport Global Says The Steel Industry Is Due For A Bounce,"Steel stocks have been in focus in 2018 after the steel industry was one of the first to be dragged into the global trade war. Steel stocks have run out of steam in recent months, but one analyst says the steel industry is due for a bounce. The Analyst On Thursday, Seaport Global analyst Derek Hernandez initiated coverage of the following five steel stocks: Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) - Buy rating, $75 price target. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) - Buy rating, $55 price target. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) - Buy rating, $35 price target. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) - Neutral rating, $5 price target. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) - Neutral rating, $20 price target. The Thesis U.S. policy uncertainty and recent declines in forward steel pricing have outweighed the bullish outlook for long-term global steel demand as of late. “Despite elevated earnings in 2018, valuations have pulled back significantly in recent months as doubt and insecurity have followed the year’s early exuberance. We view this pullback as an opportunity to buy market leaders,” Hernandez wrote in the note. Hernandez expects the Trump administration to continue to support the U.S. steel industry via Section 232 tariffs through at least 2020, despite investor concerns that an end to the Section 232 tariffs are always only a tweet away. While Hernandez says the steel tariffs are certainly on the table as a trade war bargaining chip, Trump would likely replace the tariffs with quotas in the event he agrees to drop them. While Hernandez is bullish on the U.S. steel space overall, he said Nucor is his top stock pick given its strong balance sheet, organic growth initiatives and potential for acquisitions.

2018-10-15,"Credit Suisse Downgrades American Steel Sector On Supply, Interest Rate Concerns","The volatile steel sector has yet to obtain the stamp of approval from sell-side firms despite expectations that President Donald Trump's tariffs could lend support. Ahead of the third-quarter reporting season, Credit Suisse downgraded the U.S. steel sector from Overweight to Market Weight. The Analyst Analyst Curt Woodworth has the following ratings and price targets for some of the steel and mining stocks in Credit Suisse's coverage universe: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X): Maintained Outperform/price target reduced from $48 to $40. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target reduced from $77 to $74. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target reduced from $55 to $51. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target increased from $11 to $13. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS): Maintained Outperform/price target increased from $6 to $7. The Thesis Increasing supply into the sheet market and concerns over rising interest rates that are hurting demand are the twin reasons behind Credit Suisse's downgrade of the steel sector, Woodworth said in a Monday note. (See his track record here.) Even as additional capacity is expected to come online from U.S. Steel, ArcelorMittal SA (NYSE:MT) and others, domestic steel production recently hit a four-year high, the analyst said, citing AISI data. Production rates are up by an annualized 6 metric tons, he said. At the same time, HRC prices continued to slide, Woodworth said. Credit Suisse also sees risks stemming from a potential rollback of tariffs due to the likelihood of the U.S. and Canada's NAFTA deal winning approval in early 2019. Electric arc furnace capacity expansions are expected to flood the market by 2020-21, according to Credit Suisse. The firm also expects downstream rolling capacity to ramp up in 2019-20. Capital allocation by steel companies has disappointed relative to investors' wish lists, Woodworth said. The analyst noted a surge in capex in 2018 — with the possibility of more to come in 2019 — and an increase in M&A activity. Although the analyst is in favor of a higher internal rate of return growth spend, he said the companies should have more balanced capital returns. The pace of share buybacks could also disappoint, Woodworth said. These factors could temper investor excitement in the sector, limiting the potential for multiple expansion given the peak margins and cycle fears, the analyst said. Credit Suisse's upbeat stance on U.S. Steel and AK Steel is due to expectations for upside to Street estimates for those companies on the basis of better 2019 contract pricing and more attractive valuations relative to historical forward multiples, Woodworth said. The Price Action The VANECK VECTORS/STL ETF (NYSE:SLX) was up 0.38 percent at $44.37 at the time of publication Monday.

2018-11-27,Steel Stocks Have Wall Street's Attention,"The U.S. steel industry has had a volatile couple of years with fluctuations in steel prices and uncertainty surrounding the fate of steel tariffs in an ongoing trade war. This week, several Wall Street analysts weighed in on steel stocks ahead of the G20 summit of world leaders. New Steel Mill After Monday's market close, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) announced plans to build a new $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion electric-arc-furnace (EAF) carbon sheet steel mill in the U.S. KeyBanc analyst Philip Gibbs said Steel Dynamics investors may have mixed feelings about the new mill. “U.S. carbon sheet-based stocks will likely be weaker tomorrow on the potential for further U.S. supply growth, while STLD investors may be a bit disappointed via potential for less bandwidth to pursue full-out share buyback momentum ($729M left at September's end),” Gibbs wrote in a note. Gibbs said the prospect of more steel supply in the U.S. market will likely weigh on steel prices and maintains a Sector Weight rating for Steel Dynamics stock. Steel Price Forecast On Tuesday, Longbow Research lowered its 2019 HRC steel spot price target by $10 to $15/ton and is now calling for 2019 prices to range between $790 and $795/ton. The new target represents roughly 5 percent downside from 2018 average prices. Despite the bearish adjustment, Longbow analyst Chris Olin reiterated his Buy rating and $40 price target for U.S. Steel (NYSE:X). “We believe the shares are significantly undervalued, even after adjusting for potential market headwinds,” Olin said. Sentiment Falling UBS analyst Andreas Bokkenheuser said net sentiment for the steel group declined in the third quarter. “Average Net Sentiment for all producers remained above global peers (possibly on account of Section 232 support), but directionally still down. We note that Net Sentiment serves as a potential leading indicator for operational performance,” Bokkenheuser wrote in a note. He said U.S. Steel has the highest net sentiment in the quarter, followed by Steel Dynamics, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS). UBS has the following ratings and price targets for the U.S. steel group: Nucor: Neutral, $63 target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral, $48 target. U.S. Steel: Sell, $28 target. AK Steel: Sell, $3.25 target.

2018-12-13,"Jim Cramer Shares His Thoughts On CyrusOne, US Steel And More","On CNBC's Mad Money Lightning Round, Jim Cramer said he likes CyrusOne Inc (NASDAQ:CONE). He added that it has 3 percent yield, which isn't that high, but it has got a great growth and it's not slowing down. Cramer advised his viewer to sell United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) and keep Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), which has a very good balance sheet and a good dividend policy. Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV) acts badly and it is down 22 percent, said Cramer. He thinks that other people like United Continental Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:UAL) better. Cramer wouldn't buy a bank stock, so he can't allow his viewers to buy PacWest Bancorp (NASDAQ:PACW).

2018-12-18,Large 3PLs break into frothy Memphis headhaul market,"Long considered an asset stronghold, Memphis welcomes big brokerages Small and midsize brokers still find Memphis market difficult If you're a broker who wants to play in the Memphis freight market, you'd better come with capacity at scale and a willingness to feel some pain in order to build long-term, meaningful relationships. That's what we've been hearing from brokers at Trident, Avenger, Redwood, and Echo (NASDAQ:ECHO). There's a huge volume of freight outbound from Memphis, but until recently large asset-based carriers like JB Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT), Schneider (NYSE:SNDR), Werner (NASDAQ:WERN), and Knight-Swift Transportation (NYSE:KNX) have had the market locked up. Only in the past few years have major 3PLs made headway with high-volume shippers, and small brokerages still don't feel welcome. Memphis, Tennessee is one of the strongest headhaul markets in the country, consistently producing more outbound freight than it takes in. Even though it's not a major market in terms of absolute volume—Memphis tenders about a third of the loads that Atlanta does—the imbalance between inbound and outbound freight is roughly equivalent to Los Angeles. But why? SONAR's headhaul index measures the balance between outbound and inbound freight for any given market: it's calculated each day by simply subtracting inbound volume from outbound volume. Memphis (HAUL.MEM) scored a 63.08 last Friday; for reference, Los Angeles (HAUL.LAX) was at 63.51 and Chicago (HAUL.CHI) posted a 45.43. The higher the score, the more outbound freight a market has compared to inbound. Memphis is one of the most lopsided freight markets in the country. (Map: FreightWaves SONAR) The lopsided freight flows in and out of Memphis mean that shippers have to pay more to secure outbound capacity. You can see how Memphis' high headhaul score puts capacity at a premium by comparing it to another market like New Orleans (HAUL.MSY), which has a headhaul score of 12. According to DAT's RateView tool, over the past seven days dry vans from Memphis to Atlanta brought in $2.29/mile net of fuel, while the rate from New Orleans to Atlanta averaged only $1.71/mile net of fuel. Those lanes have maintained a fairly stable 50-60 ct/mile spread. What makes Memphis such an important source of trucking freight? There are two major factors: transportation infrastructure and large shippers. Five of North America's Class 1 railroads meet in Memphis: CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), BNSF (NYSE:BRK), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), and Canadian National (NYSE:CNI). That junction has made Memphis the third largest rail hub in the country after Chicago and St. Louis. There are also a number of very large shippers, from steel manufacturers like Nucor (NYSE:NUE) and Big River Steel to International Paper (NYSE:IP). FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) headquarters in Memphis also makes it a destination for e-commerce shippers who move high-value product and who need large quality carriers they can trust. Nike (NYSE:NKE) has 2.5M square feet of distribution center space in the market; Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) has more than 1M square feet in nearby Olive Branch. Those needs have tended to put a damper on small and midsize brokerages looking for an entry point into the market. There's so much freight coming out, but from a brokerage standpoint it's very difficult, admitted Carter Garret, VP at Trident Transport. We don't have a lot of leverage… at the end of the day Memphis is an asset stronghold due in part to the rail spur. You have a lot of trucking companies in the area, and they have good relationships with those shippers and dominate the freight going back in. We've never been able to establish a strong presence there, said Rush Feldhacker, VP of Sales at Trident. I've never seen anybody have a great brokerage set up of any size there. It's one of those areas where you don't try to compete that much because you're at a disadvantage; you're just not able to compete on price. Spot rates on outbound Memphis are inflated—it's difficult to get a truck for a reasonable price. Don't miss it. Register today. An executive at another Chattanooga-based brokerage agreed, and also said that working with the railroads was difficult for asset-light providers. The other challenge from a brokerage standpoint is the rail, said Jason Roberts, Director of Business Development at Avenger Logistics. In my experience, we have a big challenge trying to handle business coming in and out of the rail yards, because the rail has very specific requirements as to who can and cannot come into the yard. They want our MC number on the truck and there's extra registration involved for each yard. I had to get a truck driver to put a piece of cardboard with our MC number on the side of his truck just to get into the rail yard. Memphis has been a well-priced headhaul market for a long time, Roberts said, and carriers strategically allocated assets to the area. Price isn't what keeps us out, Roberts said. The previously established relationships with the current customer base that's there is what keeps us from really being able to put a dent in it. The challenge for the brokerage is how do you establish that same relationship and fill that value proposition to those customers who are already doing business with those carriers, Roberts said. It's about pushing out carriers who aren't based in Memphis into that area more often—and we have to rely on the business being there in order to sell the same piece to our trucks going into that market. Two larger Chicago-based brokerages said they have had more success convincing big shippers to give them freight. My view of Memphis is that it's an extremely strong secondary market, said Christopher Thornycroft, SVP of Operations at Redwood Logistics. It's not by volume the same as Chicago, Atlanta, or Los Angeles—it's different in that way, but it's so sustainable because it's the largest DC network in the country. Therefore you have carriers who have a heavy stream of regular freight, plus a just-in-time market that establishes itself. Redwood has more than 200 active carriers out of Memphis proper, Thornycroft said, and forty of those are designated as ‘strong relationships.' It's a market that gets impacted by produce, by retail, even by back-to-school, Thornycroft added. If there is a market out there, it touches Memphis. That does make it more difficult for some brokers to get involved, because you've got to have some skin in the game. A pricing algorithm is going to expose you to loss and you have to be able to hang on and grit your teeth, especially in the beginning years. It's a game of figuring out what don't [asset-based carriers] want, and if that's the case, it has its difficulties as well. But where there's pain, there's often opportunity, Thornycroft said. Adam Markman, Division VP at Echo Global Logistics, said that since about 2014 supply chain managers at large shippers have begun changing how they think about their transportation needs. Flexibility and creativity are now considered paramount, which has been a boon to 3PLs with access to lots of capacity. Supply chain managers say ‘this is how it was last year, not sure how it's gonna be this year,' Markman said. There can be multiple swings based on pricing and seasonality and some challenges based on shippers and relationships, but as the market has evolved over the last couple years, we've done well. There are larger corporations and shippers in Memphis who control a lot of the capacity, so you have to make adjustments based on that, Markman said, noting that 3PLs had a role to play on weekends and fulfilling otherwise difficult load/unload times.

2019-01-28,"Morgan Stanley Upgrades US Steel, Sees Near-Term Bounce In Steel Prices","Steel stocks have taken a beating in the past year, but one Wall Street analyst said Monday a seasonal ramp in U.S. steel demand should help boost prices in the near-term. The Analyst Morgan Stanley analyst Piyush Sood made the following changes to his steel coverage: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) downgraded from Overweight to Equal-Weight, price target cut from $5 to $3. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) upgraded from Underweight to Equal-Weight, price target cut from $30 to $21. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $10.50 to $10. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $26 to $21. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $73 to $62. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) reiterated at Underweight, price target cut from $26 to $22. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Overweight, price target cut from $52 to $42. The Thesis Market dynamics should stabilize steel prices and most steel stocks in the first half of 2019, Sood said. However, he wouldn’t be surprised to see downward pressure on steel prices resume in the second half of the year. “As tariffs are eased further in 2019 and supply/imports increase, steel prices will once again come under pressure, beginning in 2H19,” Sood wrote in a note. He said buyers have mostly stayed on the sidelines in recent in anticipation of lower prices down the road. That dynamic drove hot rolled coil steel prices down from a peak of $920/t in summer 2018 to recent levels of between $640/t and $690/t. Morgan Stanley forecasts late Q1 and Q2 HRC prices of around $700/t driven in part by China stimulus demand. In the longer term, the firm is forecasting 2020 and 2021 HRC prices of $660/t and $640/t, respectively. Price Action Here’s how the steel stocks mentioned reacted to the new commentary Monday: U.S. Steel was down 0.1 percent. Steel Dynamics was down 0.4 percent. Schnitzer Steel was down 2.4 percent. Nucor was down 1.2 percent. Commercial Metals was down 1.1 percent. Cleveland Cliffs was down 1.9 percent. A.K. Steel was down 6.4 percent.

2019-04-04,Major Steel Shipper To Build $1.35 Billion Facility In Kentucky,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) will build a $1.35 billion manufacturing facility in Brandenburg, Kentucky, the company announced. This steel mill will create 400 jobs in the rural town while expanding the Charlotte-based company's presence in the Midwest. The facility will be capable of producing approximately 1.2 million tons of steel plate products per year. Nucor expects the plant to be fully operational by 2022. Nucor Corporation primarily ships using flatbeds and railroads, moving hundreds of shipments per day between its subsidiary companies and customer locations. The company has three other steel plate mills operating in Alabama, North Carolina and Texas. Nucor President, CEO and Chairman John Ferrigola described the location of the new plate mill as strategic in a January 7 call with investors, noting its close proximity to scrap metal yards in the Midwest, as well as to a large portion of Nucor's customer base. This investment will enable us to build a clear market leadership position in the U.S. plate market, Ferriola said. Our acquisition of the Gallatin sheet mill in Ghent, Kentucky five years ago has been a tremendous success, and we are pleased to add a second mill in the state. According to Ferrigola, proximity to customers will allow for better service and better on-time delivery. In 2017, the midwestern United States accounted for the largest demand for steel at 1.8 million tons. The Southeast and South Central regions were close behind at 1.4 million tons and 1.25 million tons, respectively. The North Carolina and Alabama plate mills produce a combined 2.9 million tons of steel plate annually. The new Kentucky mill will be capable of producing 1.2 million tons of steel annually, while cutting down on shipping costs and capitalizing on an abundance of nearby scrap metal used in its recycling business. Nucor Corporation is North America's largest producer and recycler of steel and steel products and employs more than 25,000 throughout the United States and Canada. The company reported record net earnings of $2.36 billion and shipped record amounts of steel in 2018. The trend may very well continue after completion of the new Kentucky mill, as the new steel mill in Brandenburg will translate to hundreds of loads shipping per day from that facility, as well as loads of scrap metal shipping inbound to be melted down for recycling. It is difficult to estimate the load count per day that will ship from the new Brandenburg mill, according to a source at Nucor's Tuscaloosa, Alabama, site. Loads will ship via rail, barge and truckload daily. Load volumes will be consistent month-to-month. Though the location of the mill has been described as strategic, it is too soon to tell what challenges Nucor may experience in terms of truckload capacity in that area. The rust belt is tight enough, explained a flatbed expert at a Chattanooga brokerage. When you come that far south, what you're doing is extending the rust belt, stretching it into a bigger size. That's going to be tough on capacity. Though it's location on the Ohio River is ideal for transporting bulk shipments of scrap metal, sourcing flatbed capacity may prove to be difficult. Louisville is located between the Indianapolis and Nashville markets, both of which provide many options for flatbed drivers, especially in peak construction seasons. The mill will not be operational until 2022, but will likely provide plenty of job site freight during its construction. Nucor's new plate mill will produce cut-to-length, coiled, heat-treated and discrete plate ranging from 60 to 160 inches wide, and in gauges from 3/16 of an inch to 14 inches. The Brandenburg mill will strengthen Nucor's plate product portfolio significantly, and give the company the ability to produce speciality plate products that generate higher margins. Nucor's new mill will allow the company to produce 97 percent of the steel plate in demand in the United States, something only one other domestic steel producer has accomplished. Nucor acquired Gallatin Steel Co. from Gerdau SA and ArcelorMittal in 2014 for approximately $780 million. In 2018, Nucor announced a $165 million, 70-job expansion to the Ghent facility, planning to nearly double its capacity for rolled steel. The facility is undergoing two major investment projects, including a new galvanizing line and a project to increase its hot rolled coil capacity. The new galvanizing line is expected to be operational during the second quarter of 2019, and the plant's hot rolled capacity is expected to increase by 2021. The new Brandenburg facility, as well as the Gallatin expansions, represent over $2 billion in investments by Nucor in Kentucky. The new mill will also generate as many as 2,000 construction jobs before it is fully operational. Nucor was founded in 1955 by Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile, when he left his company following a stockholder dispute.

2019-04-11,Bank Of America Gives US Steel A Double Downgrade As Steel Prices Soften,"U.S. steel pricing is not where analysts had anticipated this spring, and one analyst says lower steel prices are bad news for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). The Analyst Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners downgraded U.S. Steel from Buy to Underperform and cut her price target from $31 to $18. The Thesis Steel prices typically peak during the spring season, but Bank of America’s latest pricing checks indicate hot rolled coil prices recently hit their lows for the year. Despite higher international iron ore prices, scrap prices dropped $25/t in April from March levels. Tanners says without a solid pricing environment, it will be very difficult for U.S. Steel to gain any traction in the market. “Our X downgrade reflects a view that without a near-term pricing catalyst, shares face headwinds from anticipated cash burn of $150-200M for 2019E-2021E amid elevated capex needs,” Tanners wrote in a note. U.S. steel typically prices between $50 and $100/t above landed import prices, but mills have recently been pricing sheets at or below import prices. After meeting with steel buyers, Tanners said U.S. mills are competing for market share by oversupplying the market and driving prices down. Bank of America cut its 2019 HRC price estimate from $730/t to $699/t, including a price forecast of $710/t in the second quarter. Tanners says given the difficult environment, she much prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD) over U.S. Steel given their near-term cash flow outlook. Price Action Following the downgrade and additional downgrade from Credit Suisse on Tuesday, U.S. Steel shares are down 15.8 percent on the week. The stock traded around $16.80 at time of publication.

2019-05-17,"Reports: US Set To Drop Steel And Aluminum Tariffs On Mexico, Canada","The United States is planning to lift steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada, clearing the way for ratification of the so-called United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, the replacement for NAFTA, according to a Bloomberg report. The industry reacted to the report with stocks spiking higher for several U.S. steel and aluminum producers. What To Know Bloomberg cited unnamed sources as saying the tariffs will be dropped, with federal officials instead taking a stronger stance on enforcement, opening the door to ratification of USMCA. According to the report, officials are still trying to work out a key issue of an effective date for removing the tariffs. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley of Iowa said in an Instagram Post earlier this week that if it was true that talks were closing in on lifting the tariffs, it would go a long way to opening the door to completion of the trade deal. Stocks Move While these stocks did trade higher after Bloomberg's report first hit, shares were still in the red for the day. Shares of U.S. aluminum company Alcoa Corp. (NYSE:AA) were down 1.12 percent to $24.70, while United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was down 1.78 percent to $14.60 and Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST) was down 3.38 percent to $8.58.

2019-05-31,Bank Of America Double Downgrades Nucor Ahead Of 'Steelmageddon',"On May 14, U.S. President Donald Trump credited hit tariffs on imported steel with rebuilding the U.S. steel industry, which he said is now “booming.” However, shares of North Carolina steel producer Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) are down 25.9 percent in the past year, and one analyst double downgraded the stock on Friday. The Analyst Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners downgraded Nucor from Buy to Underperform and lowered her price target from $68 to $50. Tanners also made the following price target changes to steel stocks under her coverage: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $1 to $1. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $18 to $13. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $98 to $90. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $40 to $30. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $12 to $8. The Thesis Tanners said Nucor will likely be one of the first victims of what she calls a “steelmageddon” supply glut that will persist through 2021. As a result of oversupply concerns, Bank of America cut its 2022 benchmark hot rolled coil steel price forecast from $590/ton to just $475/ton. “Given a worse 2019E price view, risks of peak demand, and a looming supply glut in 2020-2021E, we see limited catalysts for the group and expect little incrementally positive from its June 20 investor day,” Tanners wrote in the note. Tanners said the supply glut will hurt all U.S. steel companies, but Steel Dynamics will be most immune given its attractive valuation, strong balance sheet, and near-term expansion opportunities. Price Action Nucor shares traded lower by 2.7 percent to $47.94 on Friday.

2019-06-04,Goldman Sachs Downgrades US Steel To Sell,"For the second time in a week, a Wall Street analyst has downgraded a major U.S. steel stock. This time, it’s United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) on the chopping block. The Analyst Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Korn downgraded U.S. Steel from Neutral to Sell and lowered his price target from $17 to $11. Korn also made the following adjustments to his steel price targets: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) reiterated at Sell, target dropped from $2.25 to $1.50. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $96 to $93. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $44 to $36. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $70 to $59. Stelco Holdings Inc (OTC:STZHF) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from C$18 TO C$17. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $27 to $25. The Thesis Less than a week after Bank of America downgraded Nucor, Korn said Tuesday weakening demand and plentiful supply are creating a drag on steel prices that will weigh on the steel stock group. “Weakening demand crossed with stubbornly high output from domestic mills has dragged steel sheet prices down to their lowest levels since 2016, and recent moves by the Trump Administration to weaken the Section 232 tariffs have contributed to expectations of ample available supply in the US market,” Korn wrote in a note. For U.S. steel specifically, Korn said lower steel prices will likely lead to additional earnings cuts and could even put pressure on the company’s bloated balance sheet. U.S. Steel recently announced a $1.2 billion investment in its Mon Valley Works facility that is being funded almost entirely by new debt. Korn is projecting $1.5 billion per year in capex for U.S. Steel from 2019 through 2021 versus just $645 million per year in operating cash generation. Price Action U.S. Steel shares traded around $12.78 at time of publication.

2019-09-04,Bank Of America Cuts Steel Earnings Estimates Across The Board,"Bank of America has cut its forecast for U.S. steel prices and dialed back its earnings expectations for American steel stocks across the board. On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners cut her price target for U.S. hot-rolled coil in the second half of 2019 from $628 per short ton to $572. Tanners also issued the following 2019 EPS cuts for popular U.S. steel stocks: Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) cut from $2.05 to $1.95. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) cut from to $4.65 to $4.60. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) cut from $9.20 to $8.99. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) cut from $3.25 to $3.19. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) cut from 79 cents to 75 cents. “On Q2 calls, mills were constructive on demand improving in H2E, but we see risk of weaker volumes and prices, based on our channel checks and recent macro data,” Tanners wrote in a note. No Major Catalysts Ahead Fortunately, Tanners said steel prices could find some near-term support from planned maintenance outages at major mills in coming months. While lower imports would theoretically boost domestic demand, Tanners said many buyers loaded up on inventory after producers announced price hikes over the summer. She said slowing economic growth in China also runs the risk of flooding the market with excess steel given China increased its production by 10% in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, Tanners remains pessimistic about the steel group given more supply cuts are likely in the cards. Bank of America’s top picks in the group are Neutral-rated Reliance and Steel Dynamics. Benzinga’s Take A Neutral rating is far from a vote of confidence. Buying shares of Reliance or Steel Dynamics at this stage would be akin to buying the best house in a bad neighborhood. Investors may want to consider steering clear of steel until the market shows signs of improvement. Do you agree with this take? Email feedback@benzinga.com with your thoughts.

2019-09-16,"Nucor Lowers Q3 Earnings Guidance, Sees 'Softening' In Some Markets","Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) lowered its earnings guidance for the third quarter ending Sept. 28 on Monday and said it expects earnings to be in the range of 75 cents to 80 cents per diluted share. The news sent shares of steel companies trading lower. Nucor's second-quarter earnings were $1.26 per diluted share, and the guidance also represents a year-over-year decrease from earnings of $2.13 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. The performance of the steel mills segment in the third quarter of 2019 is expected to decrease compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower prices for sheet and plate steel. “Although we still see stability in most of the end use markets that we serve, there has been some softening in automotive, agricultural products and power transmission markets,” the company said in a statement. Outlook By Segment Nucor said it expects the profitability of the steel products segment to improve sequentially in the third quarter, as nonresidential construction market conditions remain strong. In addition, recently enacted efficiency initiatives in rebar fabrication and metal buildings are enhancing performance from those businesses, the company said. Nucor said the performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the third quarter due to further margin compression in the company's direct reduced iron businesses.

2019-09-19,US Steel Joins Chorus of Steelmakers Warning Of Q3 Underperformance,"The steel industry's cup of woes overflows, as evidenced by a string of warnings from a few of the biggest players in the sector. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) became the latest to warn of worsening fundamentals when it made a third-quarter pre-announcement late Wednesday. U.S. Steel shares were sinking 13.455 to $10.78 at the time of publication Thursday. Way Off The Mark The steelmaker said in a release it expects third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million, which excluded a $53-million impact from a fire at its Clairton coke making facility and estimated restructuring charges. The Pittsburg-based company now expects an adjusted third-quarter loss of 35 cents per share, notably wider than the 7-cent per share loss estimated by analysts, on average. Brittle Fundamentals After the strength witnessed in the summer, the flat-rolled steel market has softened, U.S. Steel said. The combination of falling steel prices through the second quarter and a bigger-than-expected drop in scrap prices will negatively impact flat-rolled earnings in the second half of the year, according to the company. U.S. Steel now expects full-year flat-rolled shipments to third-party customers to be 10.7 million tons, as it expects to idle two of its U.S. blast furnaces to match supply with demand forecasts. U.S. Steel also warned of a continued deterioration of market conditions in Europe, with the incongruence between steel selling prices and raw material costs pressuring margins. In line with its labor productivity strategy announced earlier, the company has thus far eliminated 1,800 positions of the planned 2,500 cuts planned by the end of 2021. Pressured by high import levels and weakening market conditions, the company's Tubular segment is expected to remain under pressure for the remainder of the year, U.S. Steel said. Not Alone In The Quagmire U.S. Steel's predicament is not company-specific, as two other big giants sounded the alarm in their guidance as well. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) pre-announced a third-quarter shortfall earlier this week, citing weakness in its steel mills and raw materials business. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) said Wednesday it expects third-quarter earnings of 68-70 cents per share, below the 71-cents-per-share consensus estimate, as shipments and average steel pricing of its sheet steel operations declined in the quarter.

2019-10-10,US Steel's Stronger-Than-Expected Preliminary Q3 Results Send Sector Higher,"United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) shares were trading higher Thursday after the company reported preliminary third-quarter results that outperformed gloomy guidance issued last month. The company expects a preliminary net loss in the range of $84 to $94 million, or a loss of 49-55 cents per diluted share. U.S. Steel reported a preliminary adjusted net loss of approximately $35 to $45 million, or a loss of 20-26 cents per share. Third-quarter preliminary adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $134 to $144 million. Stronger shipments and better than expected manufacturing performance in our flat-rolled segment, as well as a contingency gain from recovered claims arising out of the bankruptcy of a supplier drove better than expected results, the company said in a statement. The company had said on Sept. 18 it expected third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million and an adjusted third-quarter loss of 35 cents per share. U.S. Steel is set to report final third-quarter results Oct. 31. Price Action U.S. Steel shares were trading up 3.37% to $10.43 at the time of publication Thursday.

2019-10-22,15 Stocks Projected To Have The Biggest 5-Year EPS Declines,"Each earnings season, traders obsess over two numbers above all else: EPS and revenue. But seasoned traders know share prices often respond to the direction of EPS and revenue growth rather than their magnitude and size. A company with a low price-to-earnings ratio may look cheap to value investors at first glance. But if its EPS is declining over time, it could be a major red flag that something is fundamentally wrong with a company’s business model. Companies can milk earnings from businesses in secular decline for years, but those earnings declines almost always catch up to investors eventually. Largest Projected EPS Declines Many stocks experience short-term EPS fluctuations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. However, these 15 S&P 500 stocks are projected to have the largest EPS declines over the next five years, according to Finviz: Newell Co (NASDAQ:NWL), -14% growth. Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC), -13.8% growth. SL Green Realty Corp (NYSE:SLG), -10.8% growth. HollyFrontier Corp (NYSE:HFC), -10.3% growth. Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc (NYSE:DO), -10.1% growth. Delphi Technologies PLC (NYSE:DLPH), -9.8% growth. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), -9.6% growth. State Street Corp (NYSE:STT), -9.5% growth. Archer Daniels Midland Co (NYSE:ADM), -8.8% growth.

Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), -4.7% growth. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), -4.1% growth. Benzinga’s Take It may be tempting to buy some of these stocks give many of them trade at very attractive earnings multiples. However, unless they can stop the earnings bleeding in the near future, the heavy losses most of these stocks have endured in the past year will likely continue. Do you agree with this take?

2020-02-14,Carriers And Shippers Call For Long-Term Infrastructure Funding,"U.S. lawmakers negotiating new surface transportation legislation will need to include a long-term infrastructure funding plan if they're going to satisfy the nation's truck, rail and ocean carriers, as well as the carriers' customers. That theme was prevalent throughout roughly 75 comments submitted to the U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) in response to the agency's request for information on a National Freight Strategic Plan. While DOT has acknowledged that investment in freight infrastructure must be considered in transportation initiatives, users of the infrastructure assert that not enough attention or money is coming from the federal government. Lagging investment in critical infrastructure and inadequacy of long-term funding solutions is one of the three most important challenges facing the U.S. freight transportation system, asserted the Consumer Brands Association (CBA) in comments filed in response to DOT's request. CBA represents the $2 trillion consumer packaged goods industry. Its members include some of the country's largest private truck fleet operators. Eliminating freight pinch-points would be an easy way to evaluate progress on the most strategically important national freight system goals, the group noted, and evaluating long-term success may require the development of new KPIs [Key Performance Indicators], as a way of capturing overall impact and contribution to the national freight system. There's no national vision or strategy that evaluates how individual investments impact the overall safety and reliability of the goods movement system, Elaine Nessle, executive director for the Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors (CAGTC), told FreightWaves. Even though states have plans that have focused state investments on intrastate commerce, we haven't taken that systemwide approach needed to make those investments across the entire supply chain. In comments filed with DOT, Nessle and CAGTC, whose members include the nation's largest container ports, called for minimum annual federal funding of $12 billion for a multimodal competitive grant program. The current multimodal grant program, Infrastructure for Rebuilding America, made available $900 million for 2020. The American Trucking Associations (ATA) agreed, noting only the federal government is in a position to look at investment decisions in the context of national impacts and determine which investments can produce the greatest economic benefits regardless of jurisdictional considerations. While ATA ranked a shortage of labor as the No. 1 challenge in the trucking industry, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), which represents small-business trucking companies, ranked underinvestment in highway infrastructure as the country's most important freight challenge. Owner-operators and independent drivers must foot the bill for repair costs caused by inadequate infrastructure, the group emphasized, citing an internal study finding that OOIDA members spend roughly $5,000 a year on repairs due to highway damage or poor road conditions. For owner-operators, these costs result in less income and less investment for maintenance, equipment, and other critical safety upgrades. Nucor Steel (NYSE:NUE), one of a handful of shippers providing comments, placed infrastructure at the top of its main challenge list. Significant additional spending on transportation infrastructure is critically needed including, but not limited to, highways, bridges, rural connectors, locks and dams, the company stated. Additionally, with the growth of trade associated with the new USMCA, the nodes where the infrastructure of the US, Canada, and Mexico come together will need to be addressed. Even railroads, which compete with trucking for certain types of freight and frequently point out that they rely on their own profits to pay for their networks, acknowledged that a long-term funding plan is needed. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), one of the four largest U.S.-based railroads, maintained that DOT should institute policies that ensure long‐term viable funding sources for public and private transportation infrastructure, including highways, and that ensure that the primary users are paying for that infrastructure in some manner.

2020-07-06,What A Biden Victory Could Mean For US Steel Industry,"U.S. steel stocks have had a tough run under President Donald Trump, but Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners says things might not get much better for steel stocks if presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House in November. Biden now has a 20-point lead over Trump, according to the online prediction market PredictIt.org. While steel investors may assume a Democratic victory in November would result in the rollback of Trump’s Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, Tanners said tariffs have historically been a nonpartisan issue. Both sides of the political aisle voiced concerns about Trump’s steel tariffs. While the tariffs seemingly haven’t done much to improve steel prices and margins during the Trump presidency, Tanners said Monday that removal of the tariffs at this point would have a negative impact on prices during a critical period for the industry in which it is overbuilding capacity. Other Political Factors One potential partisan headwind for the steel industry could be the fate of Trump’s border wall with Mexico. Most of the pipe for the proposed border was expected to be delivered by the end of 2020. Tanners said Democrats would likely halt construction of the wall, but whether or not they would tear down and scrap what has already been built could have a major impact on near-term steel prices. Two additional major political catalysts could have a significant impact on the US steel industry, according to Tanners. First, Biden’s plan to raise corporate tax rates from 21% to 28% would hurt steel stocks is Democrats gain control in Washington. However, a clean sweep by Democrats could also improve the chances that an infrastructure spending bill will be passed, a potential positive tailwind for steel demand. How To Play It For now, Tanners said investors should be careful in the U.S. steel space. “Ultimately, a potential Democrat win would add to our already cautious thesis on most U.S. steel names,” Tanners wrote in a note. Bank of America has Underperform ratings on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Bank of America has a $34 target for Nucor, a $23 target for Steel Dynamics and a $3 target for U.S. Steel. Benzinga’s Take At this point, the U.S. steel group is a highly speculative space given the tremendous political risk and uncertainty regarding the election and the potential outlook in 2020 and beyond. Add in the uncertainty created from the COVID-19 outbreak and the trade war with China, and there are simply too many unknowns for investors to have much confidence in steel stocks these days.

2020-10-21,Nucor's Earnings Outlook,"On Thursday, October 22, Nucor (NYSE: NUE) will release its latest earnings report. Check out Benzinga's preview to understand the implications. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings, also known as net income, is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Based on management's projections, Nucor analysts model for earnings of $0.51 per share on sales of $4.54 billion. In the same quarter last year, Nucor reported EPS of $0.9 on revenue of $5.46 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the consensus estimates. A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an earnings surprise and may move the stock by a considerable margin. The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 43.33% decrease in the company's earnings. Revenue would be down 16.93% from the year-ago period. In comparison to analyst estimates in the past, here is how the company's reported EPS stacks up: Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019 EPS Estimate 0.13 0.95 0.31 0.84 EPS Actual 0.36 0.99 0.52 0.90 Revenue Estimate 4.46 B 5.38 B 4.94 B 5.56 B Revenue Actual 4.33 B 5.62 B 5.13 B 5.46 B Stock Performance Shares of Nucor were trading at $48.51 as of October 20. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 7.06%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are probably a little upset going into this earnings release."

2020-12-09,Price Over Earnings Overview: Nucor,"Looking into the current session, Nucor Inc. (NYSE:NUE) shares are trading at $57.01, after a 0.82% spike. Moreover, over the past month, the stock spiked by 12.18%, but in the past year, decreased by 1.91%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 107.12%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Metals & Mining stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company’s current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 27.16 in the Metals & Mining industry, Nucor Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 40.1. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Nucor Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It’s also possible that the stock is overvalued. There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings."

The Importance of Insider Transactions Insider transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however an insider transaction can be an important factor in the investing decision. Insiders buying stock after a notable sell off can indicate an insider's long-term belief in the success of the company; insiders buying stock at new highs can be an indication the exec doesn't feel the stock is overvalued. Insiders who sell stock at new lows could be anticipating some capitulation moment. If the insider sells at new highs, it could point to the intention to take some profit and lock in a gain. Important Transaction Codes Wall Street tends to focus on insider transactions which take place in the open market, viewed inside a Form 4 filing via codes P for purchase and S for sale. An open-market transaction means the insider went into the market of their own volition and made an active decision about the potential path for a company and its stock moving forward. Transaction codes other than P or S are often viewed with less conviction as they are often not tied to a decision by the exec. As an example, transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option. Transaction code A indicates the insider may have been forced to sell shares in order to receive compensation the exec was promised upon being hired by a company."

2021-01-08,Here's How The US Steel Industry Is Getting Greener,"The U.S. steel industry is leading the world in turning its business green. In a note out on Friday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said U.S. steel producers like United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) already produce some of the world’s greenest steel, and their shift to electric arc furnace (EAF) production will reduce their carbon footprints even further. Steel Emissions Targets: EAFs are about 75% more emissions-efficient than traditional blast furnace steel mills, according to Tanners. Today, only 28% of global steel production comes from EAFs. The International Energy Agency has said the global steel industry should aim to boost that percentage to 40% by 2030. Related Link: Cleveland-Cliffs' ArcelorMittal Asset Purchase Could Help Combat 'Steelmageddon' However, the U.S. steel industry is already paving the path to a greener future, on track to produce more than 80% of its total output via EAFs by 2023. In addition to lessening its impact on the planet, Tanners says public steel companies have major financial incentives to go green. “Our equity strategists in early 2020 estimated $20T of asset inflows would be directed into impact investing over the next few decades, with $3T of assets already using climate change in their investment decisions,” she wrote the note. How To Play It: Steel stocks are going green, but Tanners said that doesn’t necessarily mean steel stock investors will be seeing green in the near future given the pricing pressures the industry is facing. Bank of America has the following ratings and price targets for U.S. steel stocks: U.S. Steel: Underperform rating, $8 target. Commercial Metals: Neutral rating, $22 target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral rating, $40 target. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Underperform rating, $45 target. Benzinga’s Take: The best hope for U.S. steel stock investors in the near-term would be an aggressive infrastructure spending plan from the Biden administration. President-elect Joe Biden has floated the idea of a $2 trillion Build Back Better infrastructure plan that could provide a shot in the arm for steel industry demand."

2021-01-28,A Look Into Nucor's Debt,"Over the past three months, shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) increased by 3.88%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Nucor has. Nucor's Debt According to the Nucor's most recent balance sheet as reported on November 12, 2020, total debt is at $5.53 billion, with $5.45 billion in long-term debt and $74.25 million in current debt. Adjusting for $2.87 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $2.66 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Nucor's $19.52 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.28. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-02-23,Jim Cramer Says 'Not 'Too Late' To Bet On These Reopening Plays,"Jim Cramer said Monday it is not too late “to make a big bet” on reopening stocks. What Happened: “You’re no longer early with these names, but that doesn’t mean you’re late either,” the CNBC “Mad Money” host said. Cramer’s picks include Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS), Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV), and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL). The former hedge fund manager also foresees a rise in business for credit card companies such as Visa Inc (NYSE:V), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). Other favorites include Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL), Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), and Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG). “We all know the day will come, the day when we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. We knew the reopening stocks would jump ahead of time,” said Cramer. Why It Matters: The CNBC host advocated that investors latch on to the uptrend in economic recovery stocks but also advised that they should maintain exposure to growth stocks. “It is not too late to make a big bet on the reopening stocks, but remember to sock away a couple of the better growth names on the way down, too.” Cramer’s travel sector picks all ended the trading day in green on Monday. Royal Caribbean closed 9.33% higher in the regular session the same day to $86.23. The bounce in the shares came despite the cruise liner reporting a net loss of $5.8 billion in 2020 as against the income of $1.9 billion a year prior."

2021-03-09,Insider Sells Nucor's Shares,"Executive Vice President Query Kenneth Rex filed a Form 4 with the SEC on Tuesday, March 9. The insider sold 300 shares of Nucor Inc (NYSE:NUE)at an average price of $65.54. After the transaction, the executive's stake in Nucor Inc. moved to 63,510 shares. Nucor was trading 0.2% lower from the previous closing price. Why Insider Transactions Are Important? While transactions from an insider shouldn't be used as the sole item to make an investment or trading decision, an insider buying or selling stock in their company can be a good added factor that leads to more conviction in a decision. Insiders buying stock after a notable sell off can indicate an insider's long-term belief in the success of the company; insiders buying stock at new highs can be an indication the exec doesn't feel the stock is overvalued. Conversely, insiders who are selling stock at new lows can potentially indicate some kind of capitulation moment. Insiders selling at new highs can indicate that exec wants to take some profit and lock in a gain. Transaction Codes To Focus On Investors prefer focusing on transactions which take place in the open market, indicated in the Form 4 with codes P for purchase and S for sale. An open-market transaction means the insider went into the market of their own volition and made an active decision about the potential path for a company and its stock moving forward. Transaction codes besides P or S aren't relatively important as they are seldom tied to a decision by the executive. For example, transaction code A is indicative of an insider being forced to sell shares to attain compensation. Moreover, transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option."

2021-03-29,Understanding Nucor's Ex-Dividend Date,"On February 23, 2021, Nucor (NYSE:NUE) announced shareholders can expect to receive a dividend payable on May 11, 2021. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Nucor has an ex-dividend date set for for March 30, 2021. The company's current dividend payout is $0.41, which equates to a dividend yield of 2.71% at current price levels. What Are Ex-Dividend Dates? An ex-dividend date is when a company's shares stop trading with its current dividend payout in preparation for the company to announce a new one. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. Understanding Nucor's Dividend Payouts And Yields Over the past year, Nucor has seen its dividend payouts remain the same and its yields trend downward. Last year on March 30, 2020 the company's payout sat at $0.4, which has returned to its value today. Nucor's dividend yield last year was 3.41%, which has since decreased by 0.7%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more about Nucor click here."
2021-03-30,4 Infrastructure Stocks To Watch Ahead Of Biden's Trillion-Dollar Proposal,"Later this week, President Joe Biden is expected to unveil the details of a $3-trillion infrastructure package. While a great deal of early attention has been focused on new investments in cleantech solutions designed to address climate change, the package will also address the rebuilding of the nation's fraying transportation infrastructure including highways, bridges and rail lines. For investors who are considering the companies that will be active participants in the upgrades to physical infrastructure, here are four stocks that deserve an in-depth look. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT): It's safe to assume that the world's largest construction equipment manufacturer will have some type of involvement in any infrastructure endeavor. The company is in the right place at the right time. The U.S. manufacturing world is more than eager to move beyond the pandemic era, as witnessed in the Institute for Supply Management data from March 1 that found manufacturing activity in February on the rise, marking the ninth straight consecutive month of sector gains. Still, the economic residue from the pandemic needs to be considered. Caterpillar posted fourth-quarter revenue of $11.2 billion, a 15% decrease compared with $13.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The quarter's profit per share of $1.42 was down from $1.97 one year earlier. Chairman and CEO Donald James Umpleby is optimistic on this year, declaring that the company has been making investments over the last few years in our digital capabilities, in many of our processes and our models, and we're going to work hard to leverage those connected assets and those investments that we've made to grow services going forward, and we think that represents just an excellent opportunity for future profitable growth over the next few years. Caterpillar closed Monday at $230.22, slightly under its 52-week high of $237.78 and distant from its 52-week low of $100.22. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (NYSE:CP): Many infrastructure projects will rely on rail transportation for material shipments, and Canadian Pacific is in a great way to move materials. On March 21, the company announced it was buying Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) in a $25-billion transaction that creates a combined rail network connecting points throughout Canada and Mexico and points in the Midwest, Northeast and South Central U.S. This is Canadian Pacific's second acquisition within a year. Last June, it completed its today completed acquisition of the Central Maine & Quebec Railway U.S. Inc. We delivered fourth quarter revenues of C$2 billion, which was an all-time quarterly record, operating ratio of 53.9%, and adjusted EPS growth of 6%. An industry leading performance for the year, total revenues were down only 1%. We produced an all-time record operating ratio of 57.1%, operating income was up 6% to C$3.3 billion, which enabled a record adjusted EPS of C$17.67, an increase of 7% versus last year, truly an outstanding achievement across the board, President and CEO Keith Creek said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January. Canadian Pacific closed Monday at $364.25, closer to its 52-week high of $385.87 and distant from its 52-week low of $205.26. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) – This Charlotte, North Carolina-headquartered company holds the distinction of being the nation's largest steel producer, the largest mini-mill steelmaker and the largest scrap recycler. Any major infrastructure projects planned for the near-future will certainly have Nucor's involvement. To date, 2021 has been a very good year for Nucor. The stock has gained approximately 37% since New Year's Day, and on March 16 the company announced guidance for its first quarter ending April 3, with expected earnings in the range of $3 to $3.10 per diluted share, which would be the highest quarterly earnings in Nucor history. March is expected to be the strongest month of the quarter, the company said in a statement. Margins have expanded since the beginning of the year, a trend we expect to continue into the second quarter. We believe earnings in the second quarter of 2021 will likely set a new record for quarterly earnings. Nucor closed Monday at $78.75, closer to its 52-week high $82.76 and far from its 52-week low of $32.16. U.S. Concrete Inc. (NASDAQ:USCR): What's an infrastructure project without concrete, and what is the concrete sector without this Texas-based firm? Last year, the company sold approximately 8.2 million cubic yards of ready-mixed concrete and approximately 12.6 million tons of aggregates. While the pandemic's tumult still resonated with U.S. Concrete — its fourth quarter revenue of $334 million was down 9.43% year-over-year, which missed the estimate of $352,880,000 — it nonetheless continued to show resilience. Its earnings per share increased 17.02% year-over-year to 55 cents, which beat the estimate of 26 cents. CEO Ronnie Pruitt predicted a strong second half in 2021 led by robust residential activity across all of our markets, complemented by heavy industrial commercial projects, including warehouses, data centers, and other commercial work that supports the development of new neighborhoods. Our key markets all expect strong and resilient activity for infrastructure, including freeways, roads and streets, either with or without the federal infrastructure bill. U.S. Concrete closed Monday at $66.36, closer to its 52-week high of $71.19 and far from its 52-week low of $13.66. Photo by Daniele Longo/Pixabay."
2021-03-31,"3 Steel Stocks Heating Up This Week: US Steel, Steel Dynamics, Nucor Technical Levels","Steel stocks have been heating up this week, with bullish moves in a few tickers. United States Steel Corp. (NYSE:X), Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Nucor Corp. (NASDAQ:NUE) are three steel movers. These stocks may be potential long-term investments. Below is a daily chart analysis for each of the three stocks. US Steel Daily Chart Analysis: The daily chart above shows there are three potentially key levels on the U.S Steel chart. The stock may have broken out of a channel. The stock was previously trading in a channel between the price levels of $20 and $25 before the stock broke above the $25 level. This $25 level needs to hold for the stock to see higher moves. Below the $25 level, the stock may not find support until the $20 level, and below $20 not until $16. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support. Steel Dynamics Daily Chart Analysis: The chart shows the stock has been in an uptrend throughout the last year, which can be shown by connecting the lows with a line. The stock recently broke above $44, an area it struggled to get over in the past. The stock then found support at this level. This is an area the stock may stay above in the future. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support. Nucor Daily Chart Analysis: Nucor stock has taken off over the last week, making new highs. The chart recently broke above resistance of $67.50 and was able to retest it as support. This is an area where the stock may find support again in the future. If the stock were to fall below $67.50, it might not find support again until $57.50. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support."
2021-04-07,Record Steel Prices Create Investment Opportunities For These 4 Stocks,"U.S. hot-rolled coil steel prices recently hit all-time highs of $1,300 per short ton. Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said Wednesday that record prices will generate huge profits for steel mills in the first half of 2021. Heading into first-quarter earnings season, Tanners said investors will be watching closely for indications from management about how steel companies will be spending their excess cash. Excess Cash: Tanners said some companies will obviously use the near-term cash windfall to pay down debt and improve unhealthy balance sheets. However, she said companies with healthy balance sheets, such as Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) and Ternium SA (NYSE:TX), have several options for how to allocate that extra cash. Related Link: Gordon Johnson On 'Perfect Storm For The Steel Mills': Why He's Bullish On US Steel, Cleveland-Cliffs One likely scenario is they will use a significant portion of it to fund working capital growth for downstream operations, Tanner said. She added that management may be hesitant to spend the cash on buybacks given the steel market appears to be at or near a cyclical peak. That same line of reasoning could discourage M&A deals in the near future given the current steel environment is a seller’s market. “While we think M&A could heat up, aided by low interest rates and plentiful cash, we see limited options for mills and likely more downstream processing and bolt-on growth, such as NUE’s recent pipe mill or a new galvanizing or paint line, typically ~$250-300M,” Tanners said. How To Play It: Tanners is projecting steel prices will trend “sharply lower” in the second half of 2021. Bank of America has the following ratings and price targets for the steel stocks mentioned: Nucor: Underperform rating, $56 price target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral rating, price $49 target. Reliance Steel: Buy rating, $167 price target. Ternium: Buy rating, $44 price target. Benzinga’s Take: All four steel stocks mentioned are up at least 45% in the past six months, so the excess cash flow Tanners is expecting in the first half of 2021 may already be priced into the stocks to a large degree. The big question for steel stock investors is when steel prices start to pull back and how deep that pullback will be. (Photo: Ternium)"

2021-04-20,"BofA Upgrades Steel Dynamics, Nucor Amid Record Steel Prices","U.S. steel prices remain at record highs. One analyst says investors shouldn’t fight the trend and upgraded two steel stocks. The Analyst: Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners upgraded Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD) from Neutral to Buy and raised her price target from $49 to $61. Tanners also upgraded Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) from Underperform to Neutral and raised her price target from $56 to $80. In addition to the upgrades, Tanners reiterated ratings on the following steel stocks: Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS): Buy rating, price target raised from $167 to $182. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC): Underperform rating, price target raised from $24 to $25. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Underperform rating, price target raised from $12 to $14. Related Link: Record Steel Prices Create Investment Opportunities For These 4 Stocks The Thesis: Tanners said the U.S. steel market has bucked multi-decade downward pricing trends and set new record in 2021. Tanners said steel prices will normalize once the industry works through the current patch of temporary undersupply produced by COVID-19 related production disruptions. However, she said the near-term earnings windfall for steel companies as a result of the spike in steel prices could have a positive impact on the balance sheets of the top steel stocks through at least the first three quarters of 2021. “STLD and NUE not only have better balance sheets as a result of this unprecedented steel environment, but in our view are well positioned to continue to dominate and operate capacity even assuming oversupply down the road,” Tanners wrote in the note. She said U.S. Steel will likely get the least benefit from the near-term windfall profits given it needs more than $2 billion in major repairs to existing assets. Benzinga’s Take: Record steel prices may not last, but both Nucor and Steel Dynamics appear to already be pricing in a pullback in steel prices at some point. Nucor shares trade at just 18.8 times forward earnings, while Steel Dynamics has a forward earnings multiple of just 14.9."

Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability.

Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the consensus estimates. A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an earnings surprise and may move the stock by a considerable margin. If the company were to post earnings in line with the consensus estimate when it reports Thursday, EPS would be up 212.12%. Sales would be have grown 27.84% from the same quarter last year. The company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past like this: Quarter Q4 2021 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate 1.18 0.51 0.13 0.95 EPS Actual 1.30 0.67 0.36 0.99 Revenue Estimate 5.34 B 4.54 B 4.46 B 5.38 B Revenue Actual 5.26 B 4.93 B 4.33 B 5.62 B Stock Performance Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 109.41%.

2021-04-23,What Does Nucor's Debt Look Like?,"Shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) increased by 45.00% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Nucor has. Nucor's Debt Based on Nucor's balance sheet as of February 26, 2021, long-term debt is at $5.27 billion and current debt is at $68.79 million, amounting to $5.34 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $2.64 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $2.70 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Nucor has $20.13 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.27. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-04-28,'Unprecedented Steel Bubble': Here's How To Play It,"Record U.S. steel prices have steel stocks soaring, but Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said Wednesday the steel stock party won’t last forever. Tanners recently did a deep dive on past steel price peaks and found a history of sharp drops in steel prices and stocks. History Lesson: So far, Tanners has seen no evidence that U.S. steel prices have reached the current cycle’s peak given new capacity has been delayed until late 2021. Hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel prices recently ranged between $1,400 and $1,500 per ton, more than double their 10-year average of $641. Prior steel price peaks in 2004, 2008, 2016 and 2018 suggest steel stocks will peak roughly a month before steel prices do, suggesting investors should be watching stock prices more closely than steel prices. Related Link: BofA Upgrades Steel Dynamics, Nucor Amid Record Steel Prices How To Play It: Tanners said past steel market corrections have hit higher-levered stocks hardest, which doesn’t bode well for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Instead, she prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), both of which should be able to offset the negative impact of falling steel prices by ramping up capacity. No matter what, Tanners said investors need to understand the risks in the steel space these days. “A cautious and nimble approach is best navigating cyclicals late in the price cycle amid an unprecedented steel bubble, in our opinion,” she wrote in a note. Benzinga’s Take: Record steel prices may not last, but both Nucor and Steel Dynamics appear to already be pricing in a pullback in steel prices at some point. Nucor shares trade at just 17.6 times forward earnings, while Steel Dynamics has a forward earnings multiple of just 13.7."

2021-05-18,MAGA ETF Is Outperforming S&P 500 Months After Trump Left Office,"An ETF named after a popular Donald Trump phrase is outperforming the market after the president was voted out of office. What Happened: One question asked by those following the ETF market around the time of the 2020 Presidential Election was what would happen to an ETF that tied itself to Donald Trump. The Point Bridge GOP Stock Tracker ETF (BATS:MAGA) tracks companies in the S&P 500 that make donations to the Republican party. The ETF had assets of $8.6 million when Benzinga last wrote about it prior to the election. The ETF was launched in September 2017. Hal Lambert, the man behind the MAGA ETF, said the ETF would continue if Trump lost and the ETF would keep the MAGA symbol. “The goal for this ETF was the have something for conservatives to invest in that hasn’t been out there,” Lambert said at the time. The S&P 500 was up 16.3% in 2020 and averaged annual returns of 14.5% during Trump's time in office. Related Link: What Happens To The MAGA ETF If Trump Loses The Presidential Election? The MAGA ETF Today: The Point Bridge GOP Stock Tracker ETF holds 152 different stocks in the ETF. None of the individual stocks make up more than 0.9% of assets. The ETF has risen in assets under management with $11.2 million at the time of writing. Here is a look at the top 10 holdings in the MAGA ETF: Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) United Parcel Services (NYSE:UPS) Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE:TAP) Textron Inc (NYSE:TXT) PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG) Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) D.R. Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI) Year to date, the MAGA ETF is up 25.5% compared to an 11.5% increase for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY). Over the last 52 weeks, the MAGA ETF is up 79% compared to the 48% increase in the SPY. Part of the outperformance could have to do with sector weightings. One flaw before for the MAGA ETF was it didn’t have as many technology companies in the ETF as many of them didn’t donate to the Republican party. The MAGA ETF is heavier on defense and materials names and light on technology. The shift in investors looking for value stocks instead of high growth technology has helped MAGA outperform. Could a Republican-themed ETF continue to make ETFs great again? Time will tell. Photo Credit: Public image via Wikimedia."
2021-05-20,Mike Khouw Advises Viewer On Nucor,"On CNBC's Options Action, Mike Khouw advised a viewer who bought the October $100 calls in Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) how to proceed with the position. He initiated the trade when the stock was trading at $79, so it has done very well since the purchase, even after the recent decline in Nucor.

He wouldn't change the expiration because there is still a lot of time left. Khouw added that the viewer should consider selling calls with a higher strike and shorter expiry against the position if he feels that gains are going to be more modest than we have seen so far."

2021-06-16,The 'Great Steel Squeeze Of 2021' Continues: What's Next?,"The 2021 surge in steel prices has once again prompted Bank of America to raise its earnings outlook for U.S. steel stocks. EPS Adjustments: On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners raised her 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates for steel stocks across the board and is now expecting significant earnings beats from all the steel stocks she covers in 2021. Here’s a rundown of the 2021 EPS changes: Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC), EPS estimate raised from 78 cents to 87 cents. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), EPS estimate raised from $4.40 to $5.38. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS), EPS estimate cut from $4.43 to $4.35. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD), EPS estimate raised from $2.96 to $3.62. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), EPS estimate raised from $2.53 to $2.80. Related Link: 'Unprecedented Steel Bubble': Here's How To Play It Despite the near-term tailwinds in steel prices, Tanners said the current pricing environment is unsustainable and investors should be prepared for the fallout. U.S. benchmark hot rolled coil spot prices recently reached near $1,700 per ton, about 2.5 times higher than their historical level. How To Play It: Tanners is projecting HRC steel prices will fall to an average of $1,075 in the second half of 2021 and all the way back down to $600 in 2022. “Our conviction of falling prices is supported by our Steelmageddon oversupply thesis, which was delayed to 2022E due to 2021’s COVID-inspired supply squeeze and some delayed capacity startups,” Tanners said. The analyst said steel stocks typically correct before steel prices do in past bubbles, making timing the trade very difficult. For now, she said investors need to be selective within the steel group. Her top stock picks include Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF), Reliance and Steel Dynamics. Benzinga’s Take: The VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX) is already up 38.3% year-to-date, so the excess cash flow Tanners is expecting in coming quarters may already be priced into the stocks to a large degree. The big question for steel stock investors is when steel prices start to pull back and how deep that pullback will be."
2021-06-16,Where Nucor Stands With Analysts,"Nucor (NYSE:NUE) has observed the following analyst ratings within the last quarter: Last 30 Days 1 Month Ago 2 Months Ago 3 Months Ago Bullish 0 0 0 2 Somewhat Bullish 0 0 0 0 Indifferent 1 1 2 0 Somewhat Bearish 0 0 0 0 Bearish 0 0 0 0 In the last 3 months, 7 analysts have offered 12-month price targets for Nucor. The company has an average price target of $90.29 with a high of $114.00 and a low of $71.00. This current average represents a 28.07% increase from the previous average price target of $70.5. How Are Analyst Ratings Determined? Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Analysts may suggest actions like buy, sell, hold, or similar verbage for each stock based on research compiled from the corresponding company. Analysts who suggest buy are telling traders to purchase the stock based on forecasted growth. On the flip side, analysts who suggest sell are telling traders to dump the stock because of a similarly forecasted decline. Analysts who suggest hold are telling investors that they see short-term or mid-term stagnation and to maintain their positions on the stock. Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders."

Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Analysts may suggest actions like buy, sell, hold, or similar verbage for each stock based on research compiled from the corresponding company. Analysts who suggest buy are telling traders to purchase the stock based on forecasted growth. On the flip side, analysts who suggest sell are telling traders to dump the stock because of a similarly forecasted decline. Analysts who suggest hold are telling investors that they see short-term or mid-term stagnation and to maintain their positions on the stock. Some analysts will also offer forecasts for metrics like growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide further guidance on stocks. Investors who use analyst ratings should note that this specialized advice comes from humans and may be subject to error."

2021-07-12,Analyzing Nucor's Unusual Options Activity,"Nucor (NYSE:NUE) shares experienced unusual options activity on Monday. The stock price moved up to $97.88 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-07-16 Strike Price: $98.00 Volume: 468 Open Interest: 163 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-07-15,Unusual Options Activity Insight: Nucor,"Nucor (NYSE:NUE) shares experienced unusual options activity on Thursday. The stock price moved up to $95.9 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-10-15 Strike Price: $100.00 Volume: 250 Open Interest: 4993 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.

2021-07-29,Understanding Nucor's Unusual Options Activity,"Shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) saw some unusual options activity on Thursday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $103.7. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-10-15 Strike Price: $90.00 Volume: 345 Open Interest: 629 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-08-06,"Cramer Says Forget AMC, Robinhood In This Frothy Market And Buy These Old-School Undervalued Stocks","CNBC host Jim Cramer is advising investors to forget the craziness around Reddit-favorite stocks such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC), GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), and instead focus on “cheap stocks” in a market trading at record highs. What Happened: “Focus on the cheap stocks that have done nothing and sell for peanuts. They’re a lot more plentiful than you might think,” the “Mad Money” host said. Cramer believes Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is undervalued, noting that the Dow component was actually down for the year until Wells Fargo upgraded the stock on Thursday. Cramer is also bullish on Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and steelmaking stocks such as Nucor Corp. (NYSE:NUE). Nucor is the best-run steelmaker in the world, according to the CNBC host. Further, Cramer pointed to home builders such as Toll Brothers Inc. (NYSE:TOL), Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN), D R Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) and KB Home (NYSE:KBH) as good bargains as these stocks do not reflect the relentless demand for new homes. See Also: If You Invested $1,000 In Walmart Stock One Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Why It Matters: Shares of Reddit-favorite stocks such as Robinhood, AMC Entertainment and GameStop are seeing high volatility in recent days. Robinhood's shares fell more than 27% on Thursday after surging 50% in the previous session. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is seeing success with its e-commerce business in recent years. The company reported 37% online sales growth in the first quarter of this year. Ford reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter last week and said it plans to spend more on electric vehicles than traditional internal combustion vehicles starting in 2023. Price Action: Walmart shares closed almost 1.9% higher in Thursday’s trading at $145.49, while Ford shares closed 2.9% higher at $13.71.

2021-08-10,"Why Alcoa, Nucor Shares Are Trading Higher Today","Shares of metals and building materials companies including Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) and Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) are trading higher Tuesday after the U.S. Senate voted to pass a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which has lifted demand outlook for materials.

The company also produces direct reduced iron for use in its steel mills. Price Action: At last check Tuesday, Alcoa was up 8.33% at $43.91 and Nucor was up 9.24% at $117.74."
2021-08-11,Inflation Slowing On The Consumer End As Market Awaits Tomorrow's Report On Producer Costs,"These days, monthly inflation reports carry almost as much weight in the market as monthly job reports. Today’s consumer price index for July came in around expectations, meaning the impact on Wall Street might not be too heavy. Consumer prices rose 0.5%, right on target with the average analyst consensus and down from 0.9% a month early. Year-over-year, the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4%. A couple of years ago, that would have sounded like a pretty far-out number, but today it might ease some fears by suggesting inflation hasn’t moved much higher than where it was a month ago. The core inflation number that strips out food and energy rose 4.3%, and may be worth a closer look because it’s a little less likely to get blown around by the ups and downs of the gasoline market. The key question out there now, which we’ll address lower down, is whether today’s inflation print might give the Fed more ammunition in any attempt to start tapering its stimulus program. That remains to be seen, but there’s nothing in the CPI that looks too dramatic. Producer Prices Up Next CPI was the highlight this morning, and that’s followed quickly by July producer prices tomorrow. That report is expected to show 0.5% overall growth from June, which would be slower than 1% growth the previous month. In normal times, the 0.5% Wall Street consensus would appear pretty high, but in the current era where prices have been pushing higher almost all year, 0.5% sounds relatively tame. Last time out, final services demand accounted for most of the gains, so we’ll see if there was follow-through In July. Remember, producer prices often can be even more of a barometer than consumer prices. Companies that face higher prices in the wholesale market can either pass those along to customers—which can hurt demand—or absorb the higher costs, which can hurt company margins. The Fed has said current inflation is “transitory” but also acknowledged it’s been a stronger wave than the central bank had expected. While most of the focus today is probably going to be on inflation, crude is also worth keeping an eye on. It’s been all over the place this week and this morning it’s back below $67 a barrel after topping $68 yesterday. The headlines today say one contributing factor to the drop is the White House telling OPEC to boost production. Whatever the reason for today’s losses, for the moment crude seems to be our Delta variant barometer. When fears of Delta rise, crude goes down, and vice versa. Speaking of barometers, airlines have been a virus barometer for a long time. Today, they might come under pressure amid news that Southwest (NYSE:LUV) has had a lot of cancellations. The company also said it’s seen a slowdown in near-term bookings and that operating revenue for August will be lower than it previously thought. It sounds like Delta (the virus, not the airline competitor) could be taking a bite out of travel plans. Fed Becoming Life Of The Party? There’s a bit of a buzz on Wall Street we haven’t seen in a while. It’s not just that major indices keep posting new highs or excitement over bitcoin’s recent gains. It also reflects growing sentiment that the Fed could be on the verge of announcing a policy change. Now having said that, it’s nothing they’re going to surprise investors with. At least not if Fed Chairman Jerome Powell keeps his promise to provide a long runway in announcing any changes in the central bank’s approach. Instead, it’s more like a long glide into the airport, where landing means the Fed announces a start date to taper some of its stimulus. The talk began last week when Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan called for a gradual, balanced bond purchase tapering sooner rather than later. Since then, the dollar index has steadily risen, gold has been on the run, and the benchmark 10-year yield clawed back above 1.3% after falling as low as 1.12% just a week ago. No single Fed governor can set policy, obviously, but Kaplan isn’t the only reason there’s a buzz. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) came out with a report early this week suggesting the Fed might announce tapering by the end of this year, begin tapering Jan. 1, and then raise rates in Q2 2023. That’s a bit earlier than many analysts had expected, and it remains to be seen if MS has it right. There may be clues later this month when Powell delivers his Jackson Hole speech or in the Fed minutes from its late July meeting that are scheduled for release a week from today. MS says its estimates are based on progress in the labor market following two straight months of huge job gains. The Fed is focused more on the labor situation than inflation, MS said, and there’s optimism that jobs could continue getting filled as the school year begins (see more below) and Covid-related unemployment benefits expire. By the end of the year, MS said, the job losses from Covid could be closing the gap and be about halfway back to pre-Covid levels. The Fed has said it wants to see actual progress toward its unemployment goals ahead of any policy move. It’s a “show me the money” type of approach where instead of trying to anticipate, the Fed actually wants a bird in hand before pulling any levers. There’s more thought on the Street that despite Delta, that bird may be coming in for a landing sometime this fall. This all makes the next six weeks—highlighted by Fed minutes next week, the Jackson Hole speech late this month, and the next Fed meeting in just over a month—stand out in terms of policy focus. We should know a lot more by late September than we do now. CHART OF THE DAY: GREEN MACHINE. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY—candlestick) is on a roll, though to be fair some of its strength is more a reflection of current weakness in the Euro and worries about the European economy instead of bullishness over the dollar itself. The $DXY has now spent more consecutive days above its 200-day moving average (blue line) than at any point since the pandemic hit in the spring of last year. Some of the dollar strength might reflect impressions that the Fed could get more hawkish. Data source: ICE. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Blue Chip Bump Thanks To Rates, Congress: Rapidly rising Treasury yields appeared to help breathe some life into blue-chip cyclical like the big banks and Energy firms this week. Those improved yields could indicate improvement in the U.S. economy, which tends to help stocks in sectors that often depend on a tailwind from the macro environment. Meanwhile, steel and mining firms got a nice jolt Tuesday from the Senate passing the infrastructure bill, though as we said yesterday, that one still has a long path to becoming the law of the land. For now, it’s not fair to steal the thunder from stocks like U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) and Nucor (NYSE:NUE), which lifted off in a big way on the news. So who’s on the other side of the ledger as cyclical and steel pick up steam? Technology. Most of the big tech firms were in the red Tuesday, making the tech-heavy Nasdaq (COMP: GIDS) the weakest performer of the big-three indices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), which is packed with banks and energy firms, had the best day of the three. Crude Future: You often hear about how crude prices can help or hurt stocks. The focus is usually on front-month crude futures, which bounced back nicely from Monday’s lows. What we don’t often hear about but could be worth monitoring is what the market projects crude prices to be moving forward. At this point, the market is in “backwardation,” which means prices of contracts expiring in coming months and years trade below the front month. A “backwardation” market is one where traders expect prices to fall over time. You don’t have to dig too deep into the CME crude futures complex to see that. By the end of the year, the market trades about 75 cents below today’s price. The price falls below $65 by next February and below $64 by next April. Trading gets much thinner the farther out you go, but it’s interesting to note that the December 2024 contract has had some action lately at a price below $55. You have to go back to early February 2021 to find a price that low. While that contract has many years of trading ahead and certainly could move higher, its current discount could indicate that investors expect crude production to eventually begin catching up with demand. Or it could mean people are worried the economic recovery won’t last. Retail Investing Trends To Watch? This week’s Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM) showed a couple of interesting trends in the retail investor world. First, it looks like people are learning about using rising prices as possible selling points for at least some of their shares. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit a 52-week high in July, and investors tracked by IMX reduced their positions in the stock. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also saw some selling as prices rose from a near-term trough. Another interesting thing was investors’ apparent willingness to buy stocks like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) despite concerns over the regulatory environment in China. One month is never a trend, but if this continues it may suggest investors aren’t as fearful about putting money into Chinese stocks as some may have thought. Speaking of China, U.S. car companies have big markets there, and Ford (NYSE:F) was another stock that attracted retail investors tracked by IMX. Both F and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are getting more involved in the electric vehicle market, a reminder that TSLA isn’t the only game in town here. As you may know, F and GM have pretty decent experience with vehicle distribution.

In fact, over that time, the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB) has a negative total return of 2.8% compared to a positive total return of 7.2% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). Assuming the economic reopening will once again get back on track at some point, there could be some attractive value opportunities within the materials sector to buy on the dip. Here are the six S&P 500 materials sector stocks with the lowest forward earnings multiples, according to Finviz. LyondellBasell Industries NV (NYSE:LYB) LyondellBasell is a major U.S. producer of petrochemicals, including Olefins & Polyolefins. LyondellBasell’s costs are linked to natural gas prices, and its selling prices are correlated to oil prices. The stock’s total return in 2021 is just 9.2%, lagging both the S&P 500 and the materials sector as a whole. Its forward earnings multiple is just 6.5, lowest in the entire S&P 500 materials sector. Analysts have high hopes for a rebound in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 22 analysts covering LyondellBasell is $118, suggesting 18.1% upside from current levels. See Also: Expert Panel Talks China, Inflation And The Importance Of A Stock Selection Process Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) Mosaic produces and distributes crop nutrients, including phosphates and potash. Mosaic has actually bucked the trend in the materials sector this year and has generated a total return of 34% year-to-date. Even after its strong performance, the stock still has one of the lowest forward earnings multiples in the sector at just 7.8. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting even more upside for Mosaic in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 19 analysts covering the stock is $39, suggesting 23.8% upside from current levels. Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) Freeport-McMoRan is the world’s largest public copper producer. Like Mosaic, a strong copper market has helped Freeport generate an impressive 26.5% total return year-to-date. However, the stock’s 9.1 forward earnings multiple suggests there is still plenty of potential valuation upside for investors. Analysts covering the stock certainly seem optimistic the rally can continue. The average price target among the 15 analysts covering Freeport is $44, suggesting 28.8% upside from current levels. Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) Dow is a global chemical company that has lagged its materials peers and the S&P 500 so far in 2021, generating a 12% total return year-to-date. Value investors may like the stock’s forward earnings multiple of 10 and its attractive 4.5% dividend. The 20 analysts covering the stock have an average price target of $68.5, suggesting 10% upside for Down over the next 12 months. CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) CF Industries is another materials sector stock with significant exposure to the agricultural industries. The company is the largest North American producer of nitrogen fertilizers. CF shares have generated a total return of around 17% this year-roughly in line with the materials sector as a whole. The stock’s forward earnings multiple of just 10.1 might make the stock an attractive buy for value investors. The 17 analysts covering CF have an average price target of $60, suggesting 33.4% upside over the next 12 months. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) Supply shortages have sent steel prices soaring in 2021, and steel producer Nucor has been along for the ride. Nucor shares have generated a total return of 120.9% year-to-date leaving all the other materials stocks mentioned in the dust. Still, analysts are expecting big earnings numbers to continue for Nucor in coming quarters, and its forward earnings multiple remains just 10.6. The nine analysts covering Nucor are expecting some consolidation following the big move. Their average price target is just $110, suggesting 9% downside from current levels."

2021-09-20,Ripple Effect Pressuring Global Stock Markets,"The orderly selloff we’ve been having just got a bit disorderly. The markets started the week feeling like it was a Manic Monday with stock futures sharply lower on extended concerns regarding China’s real estate sector. Of particular interest is Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer Evergrande Group and whether Beijing will let the debt-laden firm fail. A default could mean potentially billions in losses for shareholders and bondholders around the world. This is on top of continued concerns that there could be ripple effects for the rest of the global economy as the Chinese government continues to tap down on its real estate and other industries that are considered in need of reining in. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Washington continued debating an increase to the government’s borrowing limits. The House is set to vote this week on the debt ceiling and a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating past the end of the fiscal year, which ends on September 30. The upshot was a clear risk-off tone to the market. Following sell-offs on Friday and this morning, the question now is will this become a prolonged number of sell-off days or will this signal a buying opportunity. Stuck In The September Doldrums Monday morning’s sell-off is a continuation to last week’s action, which ended on a down note as the major indices hit a roadblock following a rebound on Thursday. Selling was pretty widespread across the S&P 500 Index (SPX), with only Health Care and Consumer Staples even coming close to the unchanged mark. Those two sectors tend to be more defensive in nature. Overall, September continues to live up to its bad reputation as historically the weakest month of the year. But that doesn’t mean it can’t rebound. One thing we continued to see even during Friday’s worst moments was some “buying the dip” down near the 50-day moving average for the SPX. That level was near 4436 going into the end of last week and the SPX closed just below it at 4432.76. This morning the E-mini S&P 500 Index futures (/ES) are trading lower which could mean the SPX could start the week below the 50-day MA. The SPX has generally bounced every time it’s fallen to the 50-day MA so far this year. Hopefully, this means after two days of selloffs, there’s a chance we’ll rebuild from there. If the 50-day MA gets taken out in a major way (meaning several closes in a row below it), then it might be harder to find enthusiastic buyers and perhaps there could be a test of the 100-day MA down near 4326. That kind of move, interestingly enough, would get the SPX into basically a 5% downturn from its all-time high of 4545 set in early September. Many analysts have noted how long it’s been since the market had a 5% move lower. There hasn’t been one this year, which is kind of weird considering it’s something experienced nearly every year at some point. For the market to avoid that, it would probably help if it got some support from the mega-caps, but that didn’t happen late last week. The recent stretch has been a very tough one for the “trillion-dollar-plus” club, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) taking a hit almost every day lately despite last week’s Apple Event where the company introduced new products. Shares are down about 7% from the all-time high. When the mega-caps are suffering, the SPX tends to get hurt, too, because the Apples and Microsofts (NASDAQ:MSFT) of the world have a massive weighting in the index. AAPL has been under pressure ever since a judge’s recent ruling appeared to threaten the company’s revenue from apps. Fed Ahead It seems like we just got through the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium and now there’s another Fed meeting straight ahead. The Fed gathers tomorrow, and it was interesting to see the benchmark 10-year yield climb toward recent highs Friday, although it has pulled back a bit today. The 10-year yield peaked Friday at a two-month high up near 1.39%. You have to go back to late June to find a time when the yield is regularly traded higher. Could this be a sign of some traders building in a little caution just in case Fed Chair Jerome Powell and company say anything hawkish this Wednesday in their statement and news conference? That might be the easy answer, though it’s hard to say for sure. Before the meeting approached, a lot of analysts were rolling back their expectations for a taper timing, with some now saying the November Fed meeting is a more likely time for that announcement. The Fed has made clear that it plans to “taper” its $120 billion a month in bond buying soon, but the market lacks clarity on when. It may be hard to see much direction until that riddle is solved. The Fed might have gotten a bit more breathing room thanks in part to last week’s relatively tame reading from the government on August consumer prices. Friday’s soft read on sentiment from the University of Michigan (up just barely from the August low) also provided evidence that people might be in a cautious mode. If consumers feel cautious, that could suggest anything from a weakening jobs market (August jobs growth was much lower than expected due in part to the Delta variant) to worries about inflation. For the Fed, consumer caution could mean pressure to stay dovish and not make borrowing conditions any tougher. Of course, the European Central Bank (ECB) recently said it was going to trim its bond purchases, and central banks often act in concert, so to speak. The main thing for investors to keep in mind going into the Fed meeting is that trading often slows as the Fed meets, so perhaps expect less exciting markets over the next two days. While trading might be slow for a day or two, volatility could be higher over the next month if you pay attention to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). While it moved above the long-term average of 20 on Friday, it went higher than 26 this morning. This move might raise some eyebrows and be a warning sign of more stock market trouble ahead. Time And Materials Some of the weakest performers on Friday included Materials companies in the mining and metals sub-sectors (see more below). Even before Monday’s open, U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) saw shares melt down 7% or more during Friday’s session. This pain for investors in the steel giant came despite the company delivering what looked like strong guidance earlier in the week and talking about possibilities of a record Q3. Some of the pressure, research firm Briefing.com said, could reflect construction plans for new capacity that might weigh on prices, along with worries about the progress of the infrastructure bill in Congress. Failure to pass it would probably hurt the entire Materials sector, which might explain wider pressure in Materials on Friday. Nucor (NYSE:NUE), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), and Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) were other Materials stocks taking a dive late last week. CHART OF THE DAY: DOLLAR’S MOVE. After a series of higher lows since late June, the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY—candlestick) looks like it could be trying to break above its resistance level (upper yellow line). On Friday it closed just above that level and has moved sharply higher this morning. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. A Taxing Question: If you’ve watched the financial news media lately, you probably know about the capital gains tax debate in Washington. House Democrats propose a 25% tax on dividends and capital gains, while the White House wants to slap a 39.6% tax on those for the highest earners. It’s unclear which (if either) proposal will be in the ultimate legislation, but either could mean a significantly higher tax bill for wealthy investors, who currently pay 20% on both capital gains and dividends. Earlier this year when the tax talk surfaced, we discussed its possible implications on the markets. Investors mostly seemed to consider that issue “out of sight, out of mind” over the summer, but now it’s back on speed dial. As an investor, these things are pretty much outside of your hands (though you could write to your congressperson if you really feel concerned). Analysts say some of the recent pressure on stocks could reflect investors taking profit so they can pay the current tax, not a higher one down the road (though some proposals would tax gains retroactively back to April 2021). The important thing is to keep your head and not overreact by selling or buying without doing your homework. First of all, make sure you’re even going to be affected by these proposed higher taxes. Remember, Democrats have said that any higher taxes won’t affect people making less than $400,000 a year. Second, understand that capital gains and dividend taxes are moving targets that go up and down over the years. Higher rates could conceivably hurt the market and some investors, or maybe not. The maximum capital gains tax rate was 28% between 1986 and 1997, and it corresponded with a huge market rally that lasted most of those years—the SPX quadrupled over that time span. Midas Metals Losing The Midas Touch? If you’ve been hedging your portfolio with gold and silver exposure via mining stocks, then last Thursday might have been a huge upset. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) and Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) were down 4.39% and 3.95% respectively. While these two took a good beating, many among the “smaller” billionaire market cappers got absolutely clobbered, like Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE) and Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL), down 13.5% and 9% respectively. So, what’s with the Thursday beat-down? Considering the so-called “safe haven” status of precious metals and their miners, the industry tends to get a bit jumpy on economic data, and that’s likely what happened. While analysts expected an August Retail sales report of -0.8%, the +0.7% surprise was enough to make optimism jump, and precious metals (and their miners) plummet. Can we say there’s not enough “fear” in the market to seek safety? If so, that can be a good or bad thing. Plus, the anticipation of a stronger dollar can be enough to keep the gold and silver industry down. But don’t discount King Midas just yet. If anything, he’s known for exhibiting near-infinite patience. Well, maybe not infinite, but enough to have lasted a few millennia. It’s A Roll Of The Dice. That old expression about dice may be true for casino patrons, but now for casino owners and shareholders with exposure to China as well. Already smarting from the pandemic that kept global gamblers away from the Blackjack tables, now comes the wide-ranging crackdown in China, this time with gaming-mecca Macau in its crosshairs. Last week Chinese officials said they would change casino regulations to tighten restrictions on operators, as well as appoint government representatives to supervise companies. Casino Operator Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) has made a big bet on China. Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ:MLCO) also relies on operations in Macau for revenue. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) operates two casinos in Macau and also has a lot to lose if Macau’s gambling business declines. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), maybe not so much. Most of its revenue still comes from its US-based gambling operations. Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) has no exposure to Macau, ditto for casino operator Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR). This year has seen China crack down on industries including education, ride-hailing services, gaming, and more. Analysts are expecting more to come.

2021-09-20,Major Indices Fall On Chinese Real Estate Debt: Eyes Are On Fed,"It was “manic Monday” on Wall Street. In a blunt and unpleasant reminder of how crises thousands of miles away can puncture the heart of the U.S. markets, a real estate crisis in Hong Kong took much of the blame for the sharpest daily losses in more than two months for the major U.S. indices. The so-called “horsemen of risk” like bonds, volatility, the U.S. dollar, and “defensive” stock sectors climbed back into the saddle after months of lazing around the corral. While analysts mainly cited the issues around Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer Evergrande Group and whether Beijing will let the debt-laden firm fail, that wasn’t the only issue sending a shudder around the world today. Though it should be noted that a default could mean potentially billions in losses for shareholders and bondholders not just in Asia but throughout the globe. Reuters reported that Evergrande bonds were trading for 29 cents on the dollar on Monday. The Spillover Effect The news came on top of continued concerns that there could be ripple effects for the rest of the global economy as the Chinese government continues to tap down on its real estate and other industries that it’s been trying to rein in. This includes technology, gambling, and video games. Remember, markets in China were closed on Monday for a holiday, so we could see increased action and volatility overnight when the market opens tonight. Worries about the default and its possible side effects could help explain why Financial stocks in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) were among those taking the most heat Monday. Also, Energy got clobbered as crude sank amid global growth fears. Crude oil futures (/CL) tested the $70 level before moving a little higher on a down day. And the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) traded above 28 but fell to just below 25 at the close. Materials took a major punch, with stocks like Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), Nucor (NYSE:NUE) among the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks amid concerns about possible slower global growth and what that might do to the price of raw materials. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) were some of the Energy sector victims in Monday’s downturn. Meanwhile, In Washington ... Back at home, worries keep growing in Washington, D.C., as the House prepares to vote this week on the debt ceiling and a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating past the end of the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. Along with that, the Fed starts its two-day meeting tomorrow. Last month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made clear that the central bank plans to start easing its stimulative bond-buying sometime soon, perhaps this year. Following that, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it would lower the amount of its own stimulus. The prospect of central banks starting to pull back the punch bowl even as global economic fears loom larger could be a factor not just in today’s selloff, but in the overall weakness that we’ve seen through much of September. It’s less likely we’ll hear taper talk any time soon as the Fed tries to determine if the Evergrande event is simply flushing out speculators or is a launching pad for something bigger. Talking Technicals From a technical perspective, a lot of damage got done on the charts today. The SPX took out its 50-day moving average pretty quickly, and that’s a level that had been holding firm for months. It takes more than a single day’s close below a key moving average to determine if the technical pattern is changing. Back in May, the SPX had several closes in a row below the 50-day but managed to claw back and resume its rally. We’ll have to watch closely to see if that level—which was 4436 coming into Monday—comes back into play over the next day or two. “Buy the dip” has been the rally call on Wall Street all year, and analysts say there’s plenty of cash still on the sidelines. You can’t assume one day of weakness, or even weakness for half a month like we’ve seen means anything about the longer-term trend. One level that was being watched Monday was near 4370, which the SPX brushed against twice in August during a short weak period before beginning to rally again later that month. By the end of the day, the SPX had fallen below 4370 to post its weakest levels since mid-July. The July low of 4233 is still a way lower. But the 100-day moving average is near 4330, and the SPX fell well below that in intraday trade before popping back toward the end of the day. It’s important after a day like this to watch the overnight trading and get a sense of whether buyers come in and try to make a stand. Sometimes weakness begets weakness, so to speak, and early the day after a selloff you see more selling in the first half-hour. It’s what happens after that, really, that might matter more. To buy the dip or not buy the dip is the question anyone active in the market could be contemplating. In a development that may be favors the bulls, major indices closed well off their lows Monday, scrambling back in the last half hour. It was still a really ugly day, but maybe the slight rebound suggests some positive sentiment that could give things a little more zip tomorrow. CHART OF THE DAY: S&P 500 DIPS. The S&P 500 Index (SPX—candlestick) has experienced consistent buying on the dips over the last year, but a new low suggests a long, overdue correction. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.

2021-09-23,"5 Covered Call Trade Ideas - Targets 5%+ By Oct 8, 2021","Are you a dividend investor? What if I told you there was a way to double, or even triple your income without incurring much risk. In this article, I’ll introduce you to 5 covered call trade ideas on quality companies - dividend aristocrats that will do just that. I've organized the trade ideas from the smallest annualized return to the highest. Also, the call options expire soon - on Oct 8st, 2021. So, double-check the numbers, and commissions, before making any trade. Finally, these covered call trade ideas all have at least a 90% chance of expiring worthless. I also made sure that there’s no earnings release or dividend payout up to and including the expiration. Now you might be wondering, what do I know about selling covered calls? Well, I’m not a financial advisor or licensed in any way to provide investment advice. Rather, I’m an active trader and have sold covered call options profitably, for nearly 20 years. And the trade ideas in this article are for informational purposes only, so they are not a suggestion to buy or sell. What Is A Covered Call? A covered call is a contract that you can sell, and collect a premium on. The option premium is the income you get to keep. The call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation to BUY a specific underlying security from you, at a specific price - known as the strike price, at ANY point until the option expires. So, if the stock trades above the strike price at expiration, you’ll have to sell your stocks. And if it doesn’t, you get to keep the income and the stocks. Also, each call option contract is good for 100 shares of the underlying security. So, if you sell 1 contract, you’ll need to have at least 100 shares of the stock for the call option to be covered. 5 Covered Call Trade Ideas The covered call trade ideas in this article all have Dividend Aristocrats as their underlying security. Dividend aristocrats are a group of 65 stocks in the S&P 500 Index that have raised their dividends for more than 25 consecutive years. They are among the best dividend stocks investors can buy, and hold over the long term. They also have a number of key characteristics in common. First, they are leaders in their industry. Next, they have shareholder-friendly management teams that prioritize raising dividends. And finally, they have long-term growth potential due to their competitive advantages. Covered Call Trade Idea #1: Exxon Mobile (NYSE:XOM) Alright, so let’s begin with Exxon Mobile - the largest oil company in the US. Exxon operates three large business segments. First is the Upstream segment which includes oil and gas exploration and production. Second, are downstream activities that include refining and marketing. And last, manufactured chemicals which include aromatics, polyethylene, and polypropylene plastics. For this trade idea, if you own at least 100 shares in XOM, the call option with a $59 strike price could be interesting. It’ll give you $13 in covered call income at the midpoint, which represents a 5.19% annual return, and it has more than a 92% of expiring worthless. To make the trade, open your brokerage account and sell to open 1 or more contracts of XOM with a $59 strike and October 8, 2021 expiry. Set a limit price of $0.13 a share. And since 1 contract is for 100 shares, it means you’ll collect $13, minus commissions when the order fills. Covered Call Trade Idea #2: Nucor (NYSE:NUE) The next covered call trade idea in this article is on Nucor - the largest steel producer in North America. Nucor’s headquarters are in Charlotte, North Carolina, and has a market cap of $17 billion. The company currently operates in three segments: Steel Mills - the largest segment by revenue, Steel Products, and Raw Materials. For this trade idea, the call option with a $119 strike could be interesting. It’ll give you $23 in covered call income at the midpoint, which represents a 5.21% annual return, and has more than a 95% of expiring worthless. To make the trade, open your brokerage account and sell to open 1 or more contracts of NUE with a $119 strike and October 8th, 2021 expiry. Set a limit price of $0.23 so that you’ll collect $23 minus commissions when the order fills. Covered Call Trade Idea #3: V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) V.F. Corporation (VFC) is next on the list and is a Dividend Aristocrat as it has increased its dividend for 48 years in a row. V.F. Corp increases its dividend each year, including 2020 which was a very difficult year for the company, and the broader economy, due to the coronavirus pandemic. They are also a giant in the clothing industry. The company’s annual sales exceed $10 billion and has a market cap of over $26 Billion. So, for this trade idea, if you own at least 100 shares in VF Corporation, a call option with a $73 strike price could be interesting. It’ll give you $18 in covered call income at the midpoint, which represents a 5.89% annual return, and has more than a 91% of expiring worthless. To make the trade, open your brokerage account and sell to open 1 or more contracts of VFC with a $73 strike price, that expires on October 8, 2021. You can set a limit price of $0.18 a share and since 1 contract is for 100 shares. And, it means you’ll collect $18 minus commissions when the order fills. Covered Call Trade Idea #4: Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) The next trade is on Caterpillar Inc. - a company that got founded in 1925 and joined the Dividend Aristocrats list in 2019. It’s impressive because Caterpillar operates in a highly cyclical industry, which normally prevents companies from having long histories of annual dividend increases. Not so with Caterpillar, as their management team has proven its commitment to returning cash to shareholders even when times are tough. Caterpillar also has incredibly competitive advantages that allow it to raise its dividend each year, even through downturns in the global economy. So, for this trade idea, if you own at least 100 shares in Caterpillar, the call option with a $207.50 strike price could be interesting. It’ll give you $51 in covered call income at the midpoint, which represents a 5.99% annual return, and has more than a 90% of expiring worthless. To make the trade, open your brokerage account and sell to open 1 or more contracts of CAT with the $207.50 strike price, that expires on October 8, 2021. You can set a limit price of $0.51 a share. And since 1 contract is for 100 shares, it means you’ll collect $51 minus commissions when the order is filled. Covered Call Trade Idea #5: IBM (NYSE:IBM) The last and highest yielding trade idea is IBM - a global tech company that provides integrated enterprise solutions for software, hardware, and services. In the services business, IBM is the world’s largest IT provider with a 5.5% market share. In software, IBM’s software business connects applications and devices to each other. And, In hardware, IBM sells the z15 mainframes, storage, and Power-based servers. For this trade idea, the call option with a $146 strike could be interesting.

To make the trade, open your brokerage account and sell to open 1 or more contracts of IBM with a $146 strike and October 8, 2021 expiry. And as always, set a limit price of $0.38 so that you’ll collect $38 minus commissions when the order is filled.

2021-10-06,"Goldman Sachs Downgrades US Steel, Upgrades Cleveland-Cliffs Ahead Of Steel Market Mean Reversion","U.S. steel prices have skyrocketed in 2021, and steel stocks have mostly followed suit. One major Wall Street firm adjusted its coverage of steel stocks on Wednesday ahead of an anticipated correction in the steel market in the months ahead. The Steel Analyst: Goldman Sachs analyst Emily Chieng made the following adjustments to her steel stock coverage: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) downgraded from Neutral to Sell, price target cut from $34 to $21. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) downgraded from Buy to Neutral, price target cut from $123 to $108. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) upgraded from Sell to Neutral, price target raised from $31 to $33. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) upgraded from Neutral to Buy, price target cut from $26 to $24. Related Link: 2 Copper Stocks To Buy Right Now The Steel Thesis: In the new note, Goldman raised its 2021/2022 hot rolled coil (HRC) steep price forecasts from $1,399/$950 per ton to $1,572/$1,013 per ton. In the longer-term Goldman reiterated its $700-per-ton price forecast for 2023 and beyond. “In spite of our positive longer term outlook relative to historical levels, we note that the path towards our higher normalized price forecast must trend lower at some point,” Chieng said. Given expectations of a softening in steel prices, Chieng recommended investors take a more defensive approach to steel stocks heading into the fourth quarter. She is bearish on U.S. Steel largely due to its negative free cash flow. For Nucor, Chieng said the stock’s additional upside is limited following its 105.9% gain in the past year. Commercial Metals shares have lagged steel stock peers, and Chieng said the company has relatively low HRC exposure. In addition, she said auto contract repricing, accelerated deleveraging and a discounted valuation make Cleveland-Cliffs an attractive buy at current levels. Benzinga’s Take: Benzinga’s Take: The VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX) is already up 65% in the past year, so the excess cash flow generated from higher prices in the industry may already be priced into the stocks to a large degree. The big question for steel stock investors is when steel prices start to pull back and how deep that pullback will be."
2021-10-12,Cramer Says Macy's Could Reach $30 If This Happens,"On CNBC’s “Mad Money Lightning Round, Jim Cramer said he liked Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) very much, but that it was not a highflyer. CEO Jeff Gennette was doing a phenomenal job and the stock could reach $30 if the vaccination drive picks up the pace and reaches where it should have, he added. Although the stock has moved, the rally isn’t over. Noodles & Company (NASDAQ:NDLS) has been around. Although it seems like the company is making a comeback, it’s been “two steps forward, two steps back,” Cramer said. “I’m not going there,” he added. Cramer noted Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) had “fallen out of favor.” Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is stiff competition for the company. Chewy offers specialized treatment and it’s a good stock, he said. “I’m not going to back away from Chewy,” Cramer commented. ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) is out of favor, Cramer said. He recommended owning the stock “strictly as a speculation, nothing else.” For those seeking to invest in infrastructure, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is better than Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Cramer said. However, he added that he liked Caterpillar."
2021-10-19,Nucor's Debt Overview,"Shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) increased by 9.46% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Nucor has. Nucor's Debt Based on Nucor's balance sheet as of August 11, 2021, long-term debt is at $5.28 billion and current debt is at $112.71 million, amounting to $5.39 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $2.72 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $2.67 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Nucor has $23.00 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.23. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

Nucor expects fourth-quarter earnings to be in a range of $7.65 to $7.75 per share versus the estimate of $7.95 per share. However, if the company meets guidance, the fourth quarter will mark the highest quarterly earnings in Nucor history. Nucor said steel mills earnings remain robust and are expected to be comparable to the third quarter despite lower volumes caused by year-end seasonality. The company said raw materials earnings are expected to decrease in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter primarily due to margin compression at its direct reduced iron facilities. As we approach the end of the most profitable year in Nucor's history, demand continues to be strong in most of the end markets we serve. We are confident that 2022 will be another year of strong profitability for Nucor, the company said. See Also: Why Eli Lilly Shares Are Rising Today Nucor manufactures steel and steel products.

2022-01-03,"5 ETFs To With Major Growth Potential In January And Beyond, From Sports Betting To The Metaverse","The year 2021 left behind some huge storylines for investors. The investment themes may carry over into 2022, which could make some thematic ETFs worth considering in January and further into the year. Here is a look at five ETFs for investors to consider in 2022. Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF (NYSE:BETZ) Launched: June 2020 Assets Under management: $287 million Price: $24.82 52-Week Range: $22.55 to $33.26 Year-to-date: -4% The Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF offers pure-play exposure to a high growth, well publicized storyline for investors and sports fans. More states are legalizing sports betting and more sports and teams are partnering with betting companies. After a strong 2020, this ETF ended 2021 down on the year. The company counts many international names in the top 10 holdings including Kindred Group, Kambi Group, Flutter Entertainment (OTC:PDYPY) and Entain. Rush Street Interactive (NYSE:RSI), Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) and DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) also rank in the top 10 holdings. While there is some risk of sports pausing their seasons or delaying their games, sometimes a schedule change can work out as a positive with more dates for bettors to wager on. The ETF and its holdings should get plenty of headlines in early January, with the NCAA Football Championship Game coming on Jan. 10, 2022. The ETF could also benefit from the NFL’s Super Bowl, which will be played on Feb. 13, 2022. Last year’s Super Bowl set a sports betting handle record and saw heavy customer acquisition promotions by company’s to boost user totals. Related Link: Exclusive: BETZ ETF Co-Founder Talks Sports Betting Market, DraftKings, Barstool Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (BATS:PAVE) Launched: March 2017 Assets Under Management: $5.5 billion Price: $28.60 52-Week Range: $20.70 to $29.26 Year-to-date: +33.7% A strong performer in 2021, the infrastructure themed ETF could be set up for a strong 2022 with increased government spending and contract wins likely coming to many of its top holdings. The ETF is up 121% over the last three years and has been a strong performer. Top holdings include Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE), Eaton Corp (NYSE:ETN), Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC), Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) and Trane Technologies (NYSE:TT). Defiance Digital Revolution ETF (NYSE:NFTZ) Launched: December 2021 Assets Under Management: $10 million Price: $20.18 52-Week Range: $17.90 to $20.32 Year-to-date: N/A The relatively new Digital Revolution ETF from Defiance is likely to get some attention heading into the new year. The pure play ETF holds a basket of stocks of companies that have entered the non-fungible token space or announced plans to enter the sector. The ETF will also hold cryptocurrency mining and cryptocurrency banking related companies. The ETF will rebalance on a quarterly basis. The fund’s initial makeup was broken down as 32.5% NFT stocks, 25.9% cryptocurrency mining stocks, 21.9% cryptocurrency asset management and trading stocks, 15.2% crypto banking, payments and services stocks and 4.6% blockchain technology stocks. Top holdings in the ETF include Plby Group (NASDAQ:PLBY), Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF), Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) and Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). Until investors have the opportunity to put money into an ETF that holds NFTs directly similar to a DAO, this could be the next best option for pure-play exposure. ProShares Online Retail ETF (NYSE:ONLN) Launched: July 2018 Assets Under Management: $709 million Price: $57.31 52-Week Range: $54.59 to $93.45 Year-to-date: -24.1% January will likely be the time investors and retailers find out exactly how good the holiday shopping quarter was. One trend that hasn’t seemed to go away is the shift to buying and selling items online instead of venturing to physical stores. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated growth for online retailers and showed just how easy and convenient it could be to buy items like groceries online and holiday shopping as well. This ETF counts Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) as its two largest holdings at 26.4% and 10.7%, making the fund a big bet on two top global ecommerce companies. Other top holdings include eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Sea Ltd (NYSE:SE). While Amazon had a strong 2021, Alibaba shares have been hit hard by concerns over Chinese public companies. The ETF could have several storylines in 2022 with the strength of the 2021 holiday shopping season among the largest. Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSE:META) Launched: June 2021 Assets Under Management: $897 million Price: $15.60 52-Week Range: $13.75 to $17.11 Year-to-date: N/A In half a year, the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF has generated almost $1 billion in assets under management. The ETF is the first pure play ETF with exposure to the growth of the metaverse, a term that has increased in search results and implied long-term valuation. Top holdings of the ETF include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Unity Software (NYSE:U). As interest in the metaverse continues, the companies that are considered winners of the sector's growth could be in for a strong 2022 and benefit this pure-play ETF."
2022-01-05,Why Joe Terranova Bought Nucor Stock Today,"Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) looks like it's breaking out of a technical formation following about two months of consolidation. Virtus Investment Partners' Joe Terranova initiated a position Wednesday as he expects the stock to perform well in 2022.

Terranova's Thesis: When the company released its earnings expectations for the fourth quarter of 2021, the stock sold off and that was the time to buy it, Terranova said. However, he still thinks it should be bought at current levels because of the liquidation of pessimism.

2022-02-22,15 Stocks To Watch During Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"President Joe Biden is expected to announce a new set of sanctions Tuesday against Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into two separatist pro-Moscow regions in eastern Ukraine after recognizing their independence on Monday. Biden has indicated that the United States will take action if necessary, leaving American investors worried about the potential fallout. What Happened: Tensions between Russia and Ukraine are soaring, causing global markets to sink — most notably the Russian MOEX, the main exchange in Moscow. The MOEX is down 19.93% year-to-date. The S&P 500 is down 9.67%, while China’s SSE Composite Index is down 4.82% year-to-date. Russia and Ukraine are known for producing wheat and grain. If sanctions are imposed, both countries will suffer supply chain disruptions, causing the prices of agricultural exports to rise further than their current levels. Why It's Important: The disruptions in the supply chain can present a unique opportunity for American companies who provide farmers with equipment to sell more products domestically. As an example, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) can benefit from its grain trading. The following are agricultural, material, defense, cybersecurity and crypto stocks to watch if the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues. Agriculture: John Deere (NYSE:DE) Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) Calavo Growers (NASDAQ:CVGW) Materials: United States Steel (NYSE:X) Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) Defense: Lockheed-Martin (NYSE:LMT) Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) Cyber Security: CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) Crypto: Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) HIVE Blockchain Technologies (NASDAQ:HIVE)"

2022-03-02,36 Stocks To Watch After Biden's First State of The Union Address,"President Joe Biden hosted his first State of the Union Address Tuesday in front of members of Congress. In the speech, Biden discussed several items that he has already helped pass along with more future initiatives. Here is a look at stocks to watch after the State of the Union address. Pharmaceutical Companies: In 2016, then- Vice President Biden launched the Cancer Moonshot program the help boost spending on medical research to take on various types of cancer. In 2022, Biden announced plans to boost spending and reduce the death rate from cancer by 50% over the next 25 years. The Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies includes 11 companies working to boost treatments for various types of cancers. The companies are AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Amgen Inc (NASDAQ:AMGN), Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY), Celgene (owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb), Genetech (owned by Roche), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Janssen Research (owned by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)), Novartis (NYSE:NVS), Sanofi SA (NASDAQ:SNY) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE). Biden announced his Unity Agenda, which included ending cancer as we know it as one of four bipartisan issues that can be passed. Social Media: Biden took aim at social media platforms and the data collected from children. “It’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, and demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.” The comment could be aimed at companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR). A push to change data collection and advertising could hurt advertising revenue down the road for the companies. Gun Stocks: Biden used the State of the Union address to address gun control. Biden called on Congress to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and repeal a law that protects gun manufacturers from being sued. The comments could be good and bad for gun stocks as any hint of banning weapons could lead to increased sales, while the potential right to sue gun manufacturers could also increase the need for more insurance paid by gun companies and the potential to pay out millions in lawsuit settlements. Gun stocks include Smith & Wesson Brands (NASDAQ:SWBI), Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO) and Sturm, Ruger & Co (NYSE:RGR). Increased gun sales could also boost retailers that sell them, such as American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ:AOUT). Related Link: 5 Things You Might Not Know About Joe Biden Body Cameras: Biden praised the Justice Department for requiring police body cameras. Body camera companies include Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) and Motorola Solutions Inc (NYSE:MSI). COVID-19 Tests: Following up on a plan to provide free at-home COVID-19 tests, Biden shared plans for Americans to once again receive free tests from the U.S. government. Companies that make COVID-19 tests include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Quidel Corp (NASDAQ:QDEL) and Orasure Technologies (NASDAQ:OSUR). Pharmacies: Along with at-home COVID-19 tests, Biden announced the launch of “test to treat,” an initiative that will allow Americans to get tested at a pharmacy. If they test positive they will receive antiviral pills “on the spot at no costs.” This initiative could provide a traffic and sales boost to pharmacy companies that include CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Rite Aid Corp (NYSE:RAD). Pfizer’s Paxlovid, an antiviral oral treatment for COVID-19, was also singled out during the speech. Insulin Costs: Biden said he wants to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month, making it more affordable for consumers. The leading insulin providers are Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), Sanofi and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). Electric Vehicles: Biden used a portion of the State of the Union to discuss his plan to combat climate change, which includes lowering the price of electric vehicles. Biden shouted out automotive companies Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and General Motors Corp (NYSE:GM) during his speech. “Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles — creating 11,000 jobs across the country. General Motors is making the largest investment in its history, $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan,” Biden said. The exclusion of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) from the speech prompted a response from CEO Elon Musk, as Tesla remains the leading producer of electric vehicles in the U.S. Infrastructure: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is on the path to fix over 65,000 miles of highway and help “rebuild America.” Biden highlighted the recent announcement that 1,500 bridges will be repaired across the U.S. this year. Companies that could benefit from increased infrastructure spending include Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT), Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), Vulcan Materials Co (NYSE:VMC), United States Steel (NYSE:X), Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc (NYSE:J). Intel Shoutout: Semiconductor company Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) got a shout out from Biden during the State of the Union speech. Intel is building two factories in Ohio, as part of the largest economic development in Ohio history. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was in attendance at the State of Union. Biden praised the plan as a way to help America from supply disruptions from other countries. The president called on Congress to provide billions of dollars in support for domestic semiconductor production for companies like Intel. Mental Health: Another pillar of the “Unity Agenda” was to better mental health care. One pure-play company in the mental health space is Talkspace Inc (NASDAQ:TALK), which provides virtual offerings with licensed mental health providers.

The company recently reported that it has 8.91 million shares sold short, which is 3.34% of all regular shares that are available for trading.

Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

2022-07-06,Analyzing Nucor's Short Interest,"Nucor's (NYSE:NUE) short percent of float has fallen 9.97% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 8.36 million shares sold short, which is 3.16% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.8 days to cover their short positions on average. Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish. See Also: List of the most shorted stocks Nucor Short Interest Graph (3 Months) As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Nucor has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted. Comparing Nucor's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro, Nucor's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.96%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers. Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it..

2022-07-07,Why Jim Cramer Prefers This Home Builder Stock To Skyline Champion,"On CNBC’s Mad Money Lightning Round, Jim Cramer said Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) can go higher, but he is not recommending any Chinese shares.

He added, The one you would buy is Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), and it has to come down a little bit more. Cramer said he would be careful with Tenneco Inc (NYSE:TEN).

2022-07-14,Death Cross Looms Over Nucor Investors,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Nucor, which is trading around $107.74 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at Nucor's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q1 2022 Q4 2021 Q3 2021 Q2 2021 EPS Estimate 7.29 7.89 7.19 4.74 EPS Actual 7.67 7.97 7.28 5.15 Revenue Estimate 10.48B 10.55B 10.15B 8.31B Revenue Actual 10.49B 10.36B 10.31B 8.79B Also consider this overview of Nucor analyst ratings: Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2022-07-15,5 Value Stocks In The Basic Materials Sector,"What is a Value Stock? A value stock is traditionally defined in terms of how investors in the marketplace are valuing that company's future growth prospects. Low P/E multiples are good base indicators that the company is undervalued and can most likely be labelled as a value stock. Benzinga Insights has compiled a list of value stocks in the basic materials sector that may be worth watching: Huntsman (NYSE:HUN) - P/E: 5.3 Nucor (NYSE:NUE) - P/E: 3.91 Dow (NYSE:DOW) - P/E: 5.33 Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) - P/E: 6.19 Equinox Gold (AMEX:EQX) - P/E: 2.65 Huntsman's earnings per share for Q1 sits at $1.19, whereas in Q4, they were at 0.95. The company's most recent dividend yield sits at 2.39%, which has increased by 0.08% from 2.31% last quarter. This quarter, Nucor experienced a decrease in earnings per share, which was $7.97 in Q4 and is now $7.67. Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 1.54%, which has decreased by 0.09% from last quarter's yield of 1.63%. Most recently, Dow reported earnings per share at $2.34, whereas in Q4 earnings per share sat at $2.15.

Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 0.98%, which has decreased by 0.25% from last quarter's yield of 1.23%. Equinox Gold's earnings per share for Q1 sits at $-0.08, whereas in Q4, they were at 0.25. The Significance: A value stock may need some time to rebound from its undervalued position. The risk of investing in a value stock is that this emergence may never materialize."
2022-07-20,Nucor (NUE) Gears Up For Q2 Earnings: What's In The Cards?,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is set to release second-quarter 2022 results ahead of the bell on Jul 21. The U.S. steel giant surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missed once. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.2%, on average. It posted an earnings surprise of around 4.4% in the last reported quarter. The company is likely to have benefited in the second quarter from strong end-market demand and higher year-over-year sales prices. Nucor's shares are up 26.2% over a year, compared with the industry's 22.4% decline. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. What do the Estimates Say? Nucor, last month, issued its earnings guidance for the second quarter. It anticipates a new record second-quarter earnings of between $8.75 and $8.85 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter consolidated revenues for Nucor is currently pegged at $11,420.9 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 29.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter average sales price per ton for the company's steel mills unit stands at $1,466, suggesting a 32.4% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for average sales price per ton for the company's steel products unit is pegged at $2,672, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 56.4%. A Few Factors to Watch The company's second-quarter results are likely to reflect strong end-market demand, especially in the non-residential construction market. Strong end-use market demand for steel and steel products is likely to have supported its results. Its steel products segment is expected to have benefited from strong demand in non-residential construction markets. Nucor, in June, said that it expects earnings in the steel mills segment to strengthen mainly due to higher profitability at its bar, sheet and plate mills. Its raw materials segment is also projected to generate increased profits in the second quarter due to relatively higher selling prices for raw materials. U.S. steel prices witnessed a significant downward correction during the second quarter. After surging to nearly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war, the benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices are on a downward trend and have retreated to levels before the conflict. HRC prices have fallen below the $1,000 per short ton level. The downward drift partly reflects shorter lead times. Mills are also negotiating lower prices for new orders. Fears of a recession have also impacted prices. Nevertheless, higher year-over-year selling prices are likely to have aided Nucor's revenues and margins in the to-be-reported quarter.

Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

2022-09-24,"Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur? Revisiting The Market Adage In Turbulent 2022","One old market adage that is commonly mentioned just ahead of the Jewish holidays is Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur. With the holidays commencing Sunday at sundown, it is time for this year's investment interpretation of the adage from the perspective of this investor. And boy, it is not easy. The 2022 holiday is certainly taking place during turbulent times in the U.S. and the world, and Friday’s price action is certainly not conjuring many bullish scenarios. Historical Origin: The rule's origin is based on the concept that followers of the Jewish faith want to be free from material possessions during the most sacred period of the calendar year. During the 10 days between the two major holidays, Jews reflect on their actions from the previous year and atone for their sins while setting a new agenda for the upcoming year. Upon completion of the cleansing process, they're free to return to the markets and evaluate investments for the upcoming year. Those who are ultra-religious may abstain from the markets altogether during this period. Mixed Results Over The Long-Term: No trading adage or strategy is 100% accurate over time. In 2021, following the original adage was a winning strategy. There was a rare occurrence last year when the market was closed for the Labor Day holiday. With Rosh Hashanah beginning at sundown on Monday, Sept. 6, the markets were closed. Therefore, the last trading day before the commencement of the holiday was Friday, Sept. 3, 2021. On that day, the S&P 500 cash index settled at 4,535.43. Following the 10 trading days and the conclusion of Yom Kippur on Thursday, Sept. 16, the first day to rebuy the index would have been on Friday, Sept. 17 at the opening price of 4,469.74. That marks a decline of 65.69 points or 1.5%, proving to be a winning strategy if employed in the aforementioned sequence. Of course, the index did go on to much higher prices until the beginning of the year, but if one was still holding the bag from that positioning, they would be deep in the red. With the cash index at 3,695, that makes for a decline of 774.74 points or 17%. Sell Rosh Hashanah Working Like A Charm: 2022 has been one of those rare years when “selling the rip” has been the right thing to do time and time again. Beginning with the first trading day of the year and until the late June low, the bears were in command. The bear market rally off that low took the cash index back to 4,325.28 in mid-August, but nearly all of those gains have withered away. A vast majority of the retreat has taken place following the worse-than-expected August CPI report that revealed inflation has not peaked. From the closing price (4,110.41) on Monday, Sept. 12 ahead of the report on Sept. 13 to its closing price (3,693.23), the index has skidded 417.18 points or 10.1%. The cash index is still roughly 26 points above its low close for the year at 3,666.77 Buy Yom Kippur? With the velocity with which the index has been falling, it could easily breach the June low on Monday. That is much sooner than the end of Yom Kippur, which is on Oct. 5. The next opportunity to repurchase the index according to the adage is on Oct. 6. At this time, it would take a brave soul to blindly initiate longs in a volatile bear market. The number of factors working against the market are numerous. Of course, the overbearing one is still increasing inflation, resulting in more interest rate hikes. The third-quarter earnings season is getting off to a rough start, even though it has not truly begun yet. This is evidenced by several companies already warning that earnings are going to come in below estimates. In the last week, the warnings have come from bellwethers for the economy FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). Before that it was Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), which has been hammered since its guidance cut, falling from $140 to $104. The macroeconomic environment is in disarray with the war in Ukraine and tensions between Taiwan and China that may drag the U.S. into the conflict. Finally, the relentless move higher of the U.S. dollar is punishing other countries that depend on U.S. products, Last but not least, the TINA trade (There Is No Alternative) to the market is dead. The constantly rising interest is draining trillions of dollars out of the stock market in search of some kind of yield, even if it is well below the rate of inflation. Moving Forward: For those investors that were waiting to redeploy their assets at a test of the June low, Friday was pretty darn close to that for the S&P 500. The solid rebound into the close will have investors pondering if this was another “buy the dip” opportunity. From an overly optimistic viewpoint, the latter part of the old adage, Buy Yom Kippur may present investors with a lower-risk entry into the markets. Photo via Shutterstock."

2022-11-15,Jim Cramer Lists 6 'Cyclical Smokestack' Stocks Worth Owning: 'Customers Have No Choice But To Turn To Them',"The equity market is beginning to see a “fits-and-starts” recovery amid hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon start to pivot or at least pause in light of a thaw down in inflationary pressure. What Happened: CNBC’s “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer on Monday noted that a few cyclical stocks have “caught fire” recently, and these “cyclical smokestack” stocks could be worth owning. Cyclical stocks are those whose prices vary depending on the macroeconomic conditions and business cycles. Given the earnings of cyclical companies are tied to the fortunes of the economy, conventional wisdom dictates that investors should stay away from them in a recessionary environment, Cramer said. However, this time around, the Fed’s rate hikes are impacting tech stocks and speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies, he added. See Also: Jim Cramer Says Get Out Of Cloud Sector On This Rally, But These 3 Stocks Are Worth Keeping “That means it’s possible the central bank doesn’t need to raise rates enough for industrial stocks to also get crushed,” the stock picker said. He also sees secular trends such as the travel boom and favorable legislation pushing these stocks higher. “These are great companies that have positioned themselves in some terrific end markets and dominated their industries to the point where potential customers have no choice but to turn to them,” Cramer said. Cramer’s Cyclical Stock Picks: he CNBC host recommended buying the following cyclical stocks: Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE:CAT) Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) Dow, Inc. (NYSE:DOW) Honeywell International, Inc. (NYSE:HON) Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) Boeing and Honeywell have exposure to aerospace and could be beneficiaries of the travel boom, Cramer said. He expects Caterpillar, Deere and Nucor to capitalize on the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill.

2022-12-07,Congressional Trading Report: Rep. Virginia Foxx Sold Over $50K In Nucor Stock,"Representative Virginia Foxx from North Carolina reported a sale of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) stock, according to a December filing. The transaction took place on December 6, 2022. What Happened: A recent report from the House of Representatives Clerk's Office on December 6, 2022 reveals that Foxx made a sale of Nucor stock valued between $50,001 - $100,000. Nucor shares are trading down 0.69% at $151.93 at the time of writing. The Importance of Congressional Transactions Congressional transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however, they can be an important factor for an investor to consider. A Congressional transaction is when any Representative or Senator either buys or sells an individual stock. Anyone working in Congress must file a Periodic Transaction Report to inform the public of their recent transaction within 30 days of being notified of the transaction and within 45 days of the transaction date. When a Senator or Representative makes a new purchase, that could be an indication that they expect the stock to rise. A sale, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean that the seller thinks the stock will go down. In April 2012, Former President Barack Obama signed the STOCK Act into law. The act prohibits members of Congress from using private information given to them by their position for personal gain such as buying or selling a stock. The act also expanded disclosure requirements for members of Congress by requiring them to file a monthly disclosure. Trade Recap A December filing states that North Carolina Representative Virginia Foxx sold shares of Nucor. The exact amount of the transaction remained unknown but the filing states a range of $50,001 - $100,000. This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor."

Following are his two picks: 1. Corteva Inc (NYSE:CTVA): Cramer advised investors should buy the seeds and agricultural chemical company stock on its next pullback. He believes that strong crop prices this year have left farmers flush with cash and they are more likely to invest in efficient farming. “Plus, even though the stock’s up 23% for the year, it still sells for less than 19 times next year’s earnings estimates — far from expensive,” he said. 2. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Cramer terms Nucor the “best steelmaker in America.” The expert said he is certain the stock will have an up year in 2023 as it continues posting strong earnings despite the Federal Reserve’s tightening. Nucor will also be a huge beneficiary of the over $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, Cramer predicted according to the report. “Remember, a year ago the analysts thought Nucor could only make $16 in 2022 and they ended up trouncing those estimates. I wouldn’t be surprised if they put on a repeat performance,” he said.

2023-04-13,This Senator Just Sold Up To $100K In Nucor Stock,"The Office of Senator Gary C Peters has reported a sale of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) stock on April 12, 2023. According to the April filing, the transaction was made on April 12, 2023. What Happened: A recent report from the U.S. Senate's Office on April 12, 2023 reveals that Peters made a sale of Nucor stock valued between $50,001 - $100,000. Nucor shares are trading down 0.45% at $146.99 at the time of writing. Why Congressional Transactions Matter Congressional transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however, they can be an important factor for an investor to consider. A Congressional transaction is when any Representative or Senator either buys or sells an individual stock. Anyone working in Congress must file a Periodic Transaction Report to inform the public of their recent transaction within 30 days of being notified of the transaction and within 45 days of the transaction date. When a Senator or Representative makes a new purchase, that could be an indication that they expect the stock to rise. A sale, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean that the seller thinks the stock will go down. In April 2012, Former President Barack Obama signed the STOCK Act into law. The act prohibits members of Congress from using private information given to them by their position for personal gain such as buying or selling a stock. The act also expanded disclosure requirements for members of Congress by requiring them to file a monthly disclosure. Trade Recap A April filing states that Senator Gary C Peters sold shares of Nucor. The exact amount of the transaction remained unknown but the filing states a range of $50,001 - $100,000.

2023-04-20,"Mortgage Rates Up, Mortgage Demand Down","The US Treasury has $252 billion in cash on hand to fund government operations. Google, Microsoft, and Apple combined had more cash on hand at the end of last year. Market Prices as of 4 pm EST, 4/19/23 Macro House Speaker Kevin McCarthy proposed a bill to raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion for a year. The plan calls for a $130 billion reduction in federal spending, including cuts to Covid funds, tougher work requirements for anti-poverty benefits, easier regulations for energy projects, and an end to some tax breaks for clean-energy projects (like EVs). McCarthy says the bill would save taxpayers $4.5 billion over 10 years. Democrats immediately rejected the plan. The Fed’s latest anecdotal Beige Book report showed little change in overall economic activity in recent weeks. It revealed slight easing in the labor market as wages moderate from admittedly elevated levels. Overall price rose during the period but the pace of increases has slowed. The report also showed tightening lending standards and declining lending volumes and loan demand. US mortgage rates increased by the most in 2 months last week, rising to 6.43%. Demand for mortgage applications fell 10% from the previous week, the biggest drop since February. Meanwhile, a new Redfin report reveals median US home sale prices experienced their biggest YoY drop since 2012, falling 3.3% in March from a year earlier. Redfin Stocks Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ vendetta with Disney rages on. A DeSantis-appointed oversight board plans to cancel agreements made under previous leadership allowing the company to control land near its theme parks. If canceled, the +60-year agreement would hinder Disney’s ability to expand its resort. A legal fight is likely as experts argue voiding the contract could violate state contract and zoning laws."

2023-09-05,P/E Ratio Insights for Nucor,"In the current market session, Nucor Inc. (NYSE:NUE) stock price is at $170.24, after a 1.36% drop. However, over the past month, the company's stock increased by 0.19%, and in the past year, by 25.54%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Nucor P/E Ratio Analysis in Relation to Industry Peers The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Nucor has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 111.94 of the Metals & Mining industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions."
2023-09-07,"US, EU Join Forces To Tackle China's Steel Surplus, Reshaping Trump-Era Tariffs","The U.S. and the EU are on the verge of a groundbreaking partnership aimed at countering China’s burgeoning steel surplus. This audacious move not only seeks to curb excess steel production, but also aims to bury the hatchet on a long-standing trade dispute that traces its roots back to the Trump administration. Taking on China’s Steel Overproduction At the heart of this agreement lies the intent to introduce fresh tariffs, primarily targeting imports from China that have thrived due to non-market practices, as Bloomberg reported Thursday. Negotiations are still underway. Crucial details such as the scope of these tariffs and potential targets in other countries were not immediately unclear. Furthermore, this accord is designed to set a framework that invites other nations to join in the future, potentially reshaping the landscape of global steel trade. This new pact is an integral part of the broader Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum, a negotiation that commenced in 2021 between the EU and the Biden administration. This negotiation aims to settle a dispute that first flared up when former President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on metal imports from Europe, citing national security concerns. Steelmakers Rallied in 2023 The most widely recognized exchange-traded fund (ETF) focusing on stocks from various sectors, including materials, metals, and mining, particularly steel, is the VanEck Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX). Over the past year, this fund has displayed impressive performance, delivering a remarkable 35% return, with a significant 16% increase year-to-date. The standout contributor to this outstanding performance has been POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX), which has surged by more than 100% year-to-date. Within the realm of U.S. steel producers, notable performances have been observed. U.S. Steel Corp. (NYSE:X) has seen a robust increase of 22% year-to-date, while Nucor Corp. (NYSE:NUE) has posted a substantial gain of 28% in the same period. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. (NYSE:RS) has outperformed with an impressive 32% year-to-date growth. Current Tariffs and Potential Implications Since 2018, the U.S. has imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports, with the EU implementing a similar duty on a range of steel imports under its safeguard measures. In 2021, both sides temporarily suspended punitive measures on each other’s goods, setting a deadline for finding a permanent solution by Oct. 31, 2023. Failure to reach an agreement would automatically resurrect Trump-era tariffs and EU retaliatory measures, impacting over $10 billion in exports. What Lies Ahead Talks regarding the Global Sustainable Agreement aim to prepare for a US-EU summit slated for late October, offering hope for a mutually beneficial understanding. This could have significant implications for Chinese steelmakers, who have been increasing their exports due to weak domestic demand and a depreciating yuan, making their exports more attractive.

2023-09-27,Pioneering Fusion Power Plant Collaboration - Nucor Partners With Helion Energy: Report,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), a leading steelmaker, has reportedly unveiled plans to collaborate with fusion startup Helion Energy on establishing a 500-megawatt fusion power plant at one of its U.S. steel mills by 2030. This venture could generate enough electricity to supply hundreds of thousands of residences, comparable to a standard power station. Nucor is investing $35 million in Helion, which is backed by OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman, the WSJ reported. The report noted that the deal is a bet on fusion, a technology that hasn't yet produced electricity. Nucor is reportedly accelerating its green energy initiatives because it faces increasing demands for green steel, especially from major clients like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and cooling equipment manufacturer Trane Technologies Plc (NYSE:TT). We don't want to sit on the sidelines and wait for all these technologies and hope they get developed, the report quoted an interview by Leon Topalian, Nucor's chief executive. Recent advancements in fusion technology, particularly from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, have rekindled optimism in fusion's commercial viability. The proposed fusion plant by Nucor and Helion is slated to have ten times the capacity of another Helion project aimed at supplying fusion-based electricity to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) by 2028, the report said. Helion's fundraising feats have raked in approximately $630 million, including the Nucor investment. Altman has invested $375 million in Helion, the report noted.

Also Read: U.S. Steel Brushes Off Cleveland-Cliffs’ $35 Per Share Offer: Analyst Says Deal Less Likely To Close Without ‘Meaningful Concessions’ US Steel Q3 Earnings: What Analysts Would Watch Closely The company is the second largest U.S.-based steel producer, after Nucor (NYSE:NUE), and is undergoing a rapid transformation, having invested into mini mills, EAFs (electric arc furnaces) and downstream capabilities. The EAFs produce less carbon dioxide and are thus expected to benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA is the catalyst that could potentially boost EBITDA growth and free cash flow for the company. The Street knows that major capital investments such as these take time to translate into value, so analysts will be eager to get any hints of progress at these early stages. X stock is trading at attractive valuations currently among competitors such as NUE, CLF, Reliance Steel & Aluminum (NYSE:RS), Ternium (NYSE:TX), Carpenter Tech (NYSE:CRS), Vale (NYSE:VALE) and Ramaco Resources (NASDAQ:METCB). Earnings Estimates: Wall Street analysts expect X to report $1.15 in EPS for the quarter and $4.39 billion in revenue, per earnings data available on Benzinga Pro. Given US Steel's history of beating estimates, the Street expects X to record a beat on EPS and revenue this time as well. Over the last eight quarters, X stock has delivered six positive EPS surprises and six positive revenue surprises. Analysts project that US Steel will report $4.12 in EPS for the fiscal year ending December 2023. Revenue estimates for that period are currently expected to come in at $17.9 billion. Analyst Ratings & Price Targets: Wall Street analyst ratings (based on a pool of 120 analyst firms over the last 3 years) currently rate the stock Neutral. Consensus price target stands at $27.02 a share. Price Action: US Steel shares have been range bound between $31.50 and $33.50 over the past month, and closed at $32.40 on Wednesday. The 52-week range is a low of $18.92 and a high of $33.65. Read Next: US Steel Transformation Will Lead To Major Value Creation, Says Bullish Analyst Photo: Unsplash"
