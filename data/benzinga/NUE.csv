2018-01-16,"Steel Industry Assures Of Its Importance In Autos, Sustainable Client Base At NAIAS","Regulations might be restricting targeted automakers, but the steel industry considers itself a beneficiary of heightened expectations. “With the stringent requirements for occupant protection and increasing fuel efficiency requirements and tailpipe emission regulations, the deployment of technology is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, and steel is at the forefront,” Steel Market Development Institute President Tom Gibson said at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. “...Use of advanced high-strength steel has grown tremendously in the last 15 years as a result of the increase in demand for vehicle crashworthiness, mass reduction and cost effectiveness.” Gibson also sees steel positioned to capitalize on the auto industry’s itch to innovate. With 200 steel grades of varying properties, the material is seen to expand automakers’ design optionality and enable heightened safety, weight reduction and related improvements in safety, affordability, fuel economy, emissions and recyclability. “What this means to the consumer is the cost of ownership, including purchase price, insurance and repair, are lower for steel-intensive vehicles than vehicles that are lightweighted with alternate materials,” Jody Hall, vice president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, said. Cross-Industry Collaborations Considering this client opportunity, the SMDI, whose investors include AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and ArcelorMittal SA (ADR) (NYSE:MT), collaborates with automotive companies to deliver lightweight steel solutions. Partners include Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU), General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), where the likes of ArcelorMittal embed resident engineers to foster coengineering and ensure “win-win” solutions for both industries. Finding Steel On The NAIAS Show Floor Steel executives claim their value is evident in current end products. Blake Zuidema, director of automotive product applications division at ArcelorMittal, said the strength of the steel industry is seen in this year’s new vehicle models, including the Chevrolet Bolt and Ram 1500. “Not only are these vehicles steel intensive vehicles but they showcase how carmakers are making innovative use in the latest of steel technology for car bodies,” Zuidema said, noting that different steel grades are used for different vehicle parts. “We’re now designing unique grades of steel for virtually every individual part of the car.” Related Links: NAIAS 2018: VW Works To Earn Back Trust; Toyota, Ram Introduce New Models Honda, Volvo, Lincoln Win Vehicle Of The Year Awards At NAIAS"

2018-02-12,KeyBanc Projects 17% Upside In Timkensteel Corp. Shares,"Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST) shares have pulled back about 26 percent since their Jan. 23 high, in contrast to a more modest 8-percent drop by the S&P 500 Index, prompting KeyBanc Capital Markets to upgrade the stock. The Analyst Analyst Philip Gibbs upgraded shares of Timkensteel from Sector Weight from Overweight with a $17 price target, suggesting about 17-percent upside from current levels. The Thesis An attractive valuation after the recent sell-off, modest incremental improvement in industry spot pricing and the emergence of a stronger free cash flow estimate were the drivers of the upgrade, Gibbs said in a Sunday note. The firm's 2018 HRC pricing estimate is now up from $655 per ton to $670 per ton, while the CRC view is maintained at $825 per ton, lowering the HRC-to-CRC spread to $155 per ton compared to $190 per ton in 2017, according to KeyBanc. The spread is now easing closer to the trailing 10-year average of $120 per ton, Gibbs said. The normalization is a function of positive HRC standard deviation and less relative tightness in downstream products amid new capacity and import persistence, the analyst said. We believe spot HRC mill spreads will grow strongly in 2018, while downstream products will be more muted, Gibbs said. KeyBanc modestly increased its estimates for Timkensteel, citing an improving U.S. SBQ, or special bar quality, pricing and mix backdrop. The firm sees Timkensteel and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) to be more affected relative to Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) if the Trump administration's infrastructure narrative becomes dragged or disappoints, Gibbs said. The Price Action Over the past year, Timkensteel shares are down about 13 percent, with a year-to-date drop of about 4 percent.

2018-02-12,Trump's Infrastructure Plan: What You Should Know,"President Donald Trump unveiled a much-anticipated, $1.5-trillion infrastructure plan intended to “address unmet rural infrastructure needs, empower state and local authorities and train the American workforce of the future, according to the White House. The Plan The infrastructure plan aims to address traditional infrastructure such as roads, bridges and airports, as well as water resources, rural infrastructure and energy in order to promote economic growth. “The reforms set out by my plan will strengthen the economy, make our country more competitive, reduce the costs of goods and services for American families, and enable Americans to build their lives on top of the best infrastructure in the world, Trump said in the announcement. One aspect of the plan is an infrastructure incentives program designed to “encourage increased state, local and private investment in infrastructure.” The administration plans to commit $100 billion to the program, aiming to stimulate spending at the state and local level. States and counties with infrastructure spending plans would be eligible to apply and receive partial funding through the program. Some are concerned that this will shift a heavy portion of the financial burden to state and local governments. What Analysts Are Saying Analysts at Height Securities were skeptical about the passing of the plan in its current form, maintaining 15-percent odds that Congress would OK infrastructure legislation. “The $200 billion in federal spending is expected to be offset by equal cuts to non-defense discretionary spending — a non-starter with most if not all Democrats, Height Securities said. Iinfrastructure legislation will require 60 Senate votes to pass, while Republicans hold 51 seats, leading Height analysts to be “highly skeptical” that the plan will garner the necessary support to pass. Stocks To Watch For While it remains unclear whether new infrastructure legislation will be passed, investors should keep an eye out for stocks that could stand to benefit from an infrastructure package. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (CBOE: PAVE), which is made up of 89 U.S. stocks, has already experienced upside from infrastructure projects in New York, California and Charlotte, North Carolina. Steel producer Nucor (NYSE:NUE) could benefit from the bridge and railroad efforts outlined in the plan. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) is a leader in construction machinery and offers a diverse portfolio of products that could be used in infrastructure and construction efforts.

2018-02-14,"Analyst: Steel Investors Need Action From Trump, Not Words","President Trump on Tuesday said he is considering a number of options for actions he could take to improve the struggling U.S. steel market, including imposing tariffs or quotas on imported steel. Trump said the U.S. steel industry is getting “decimated by dumping” of foreign steel into the market. I look at it two ways: I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry, and we do need that for national defense, Trump said. Trump has ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, the groundwork for him potentially using his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. In January, Trump made a similar decision to implement a 30 percent tariff on imported solar panels. Height Securities said on Wednesday that, despite Trump’s tough language, investors shouldn’t expect immediate action. Height said the potential for negative economic fallout from steel tariffs or alienation of key U.S. allies are two factors holding back the White House from making a move. “We expect that yesterday's meeting was intended primarily as a messaging tool by the White House and that the President's remarks, much like his threat of a ‘reciprocal tax’ from Monday, represents a return to campaign-style rhetoric rather than a clear indicator of immediate action,” Height said in a note. If Height is correct, the gains in steel stocks on Wednesday morning may be unwarranted, at least at this point: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 2.2 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) up 1.3 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) up 2.5 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) up 0.8 percent.

2018-02-16,"US Steel, Aluminum Stocks Rally After Commerce Dept. Calls For Tariffs","Steel and aluminum stocks moved sharply higher Friday after the U.S. Commerce Department issued a recommendation to President Donald Trump to enact steep tariffs or quotas on foreign companies. What You Need To Know Trump's administration looked into the topic of steel and aluminum imports and any potential impact on natural security, CNBC reported. Steel imports are weakening our internal economy and pose a threat to national security, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a Friday letter. Ross recommends the White House take immediate action by adjusting the level of imports through quotas or tariffs. Why It's Important The report calls for a global tariff of 24 percent on all steel imports, with another option calling for a tariff of at least 53 percent on steel coming from a dozen countries including Brazil and China, CNBC said. Ross recommended a 63-percent quota of the countries' 2017 imports. The report also calls for a 7.7-percent tariff on all imported aluminum for most countries, but a higher rate of 23.5 percent on aluminum products from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela and Vietnam. A higher quota of 86.7 percent was recommended in the aluminum report. What's Next? The White House would be able to exempt certain countries from a tariff or quota, and individual companies can seek an appeal if they have any U.S. production facilities. U.S. steel producers should be able to operate at 80-percent average capacity utilization rates or better based on the available capacity that existed in 2017 if action is taken against foreign companies, Ross said. Stock Reactions AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) gained more than 12 percent. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) gained more than 10 percent and hit a new 52-week high of $43.97. Century Aluminum Co (NASDAQ:CENX) gained 8 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) gained 4 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) gained 4 percent. Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) gained 0.6 percent.

2018-02-20,Analysts Break Down The Sec. 232 Steel Investigation,"U.S. steel stocks are surging after the U.S. Commerce Department recommended that President Donald Trump enact a 24-percent tariff on all steel imports. Trump had ordered an investigation into the potential risk that U.S. steel imports pose to national security, laying the groundwork for him to potentially use his Section 232 powers to restrict steel imports. The Commerce Dept. laid out three possible courses of action for the president: A blanket 24-percent tariff on all countries. A 50-percent tariff on the 12 largest U.S. importers and a quota equal to 100 percent of 2017 imports on all other countries. No tariff and a quota of 63 percent of 2017 imports on all countries. Investors clearly see the announcement as good news for domestic steel stocks. Here’s what analysts had to say. Voices From The Street Trump will likely opt for a tariff-and-quota scenario, said Morgan Stanley analyst Piyush Sood. “We think that the tariff-plus-quota scenario, with [a] 53-percent tariff against [the] selected 12 countries and [a] quota set to 100-percent (of 2017 import levels) is most likely to be adopted, the analyst said in a Monday note. Citigroup analyst Alexander Hacking said any of the three potential proposals the Commerce Dept. suggested would generate a significant tailwind for the domestic steel industry. “Prices would rise sharply, likely $150/ton, with [the] potential for shortages in the quota-limit scenarios,” Hacking said. Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen said the potential tariffs will be short-lived and may actually be designed to use as leverage in negotiations with exporting countries. “We still see significant problems with the structure of the Section 232 process and anticipate pushback from the Defense Dept. and other factions within the administration, which may hamper efforts to accelerate this process,” Allen said. Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Terry said quotas would have more immediate impact than tariffs. “Quotas on all countries will likely have the maximum impact as it would immediately support higher domestic utilization,” Terry said. BMO Capital Markets analyst David Gagliano said the major impact of the recommendation is that U.S. steel imports will likely drop. “We believe this will result in higher U.S. production, higher U.S. prices and lower unit costs,” he said. Credit Suisse analyst Curt Woodworth said Trump has plenty of motivation to act at this point. “In our view the president will likely follow through on some of these recommendations, given pressure from steel industry executives and the win it would serve up for his political base,” the analyst said. Price Action Here’s a rundown of how steel stocks are reacting to the news since Friday: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) is up 18.1 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) is up 12.9 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) is up 6.1 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is up 4.4 percent. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) is up 6.8 percent. Related Links: US Steel Shares Drop After Gordon Johnson Issues Sell Rating Analyst: Steel Investors Need Action From Trump, Not Words"
2018-03-01,"Height Securities: Concrete Proposal Unlikely To Emerge From Trump's Tariff Meeting With Steel, Aluminum Execs","President Donald Trump will meet with steel and aluminum executives Thursday, leading some to speculate an import tariff announcement is imminent, according to Reuters. But Height Securities considers a final proposal on rates or quotas unlikely to be released. “We expect that ongoing opposition from foreign partners, Congressional leaders, industry representatives from manufacturing industries and the Defense Department will push any final proposal further into March,” Height analysts said in a Thursday note. “ ... If we do receive any announcement today, it will likely be short on detail and may ignore aluminum altogether, as we understand the DoD has significant concerns with imposing any restrictions on aluminum imports.” More likely: a reiteration of Trump’s commitment to strong action, according to Height. Trump tweeted about the topic Thursday morning: Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2018 Headlines from the meeting are expected to bolster sentiment around the steel industry — but not necessarily around the U.S. economy. RSM Chief Economist Joe Brusuelas said tariff talk should not be considered positive. The imposition of tariffs on steel & aluminum is not just bad policy but the worst form of crony capitalism. This will lead to higher consumer costs on autos & transportation. Why protection for firms that just got large tax cuts? — Joseph Brusuelas (@joebrusuelas) March 1, 2018 Height asserted that no meeting outcomes or policy perspectives are certain, considering the president’s mercurial mindset amid the Mueller investigation, staff turnover and “infighting among his closest advisers.” At the time of publication, U.S. steel stocks were trading higher off the open. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 5.3 percent, AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) 8.3 percent, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) 2 percent and Steel Dynamics, Inc.

2018-03-01,"Trump's Comments On Steel, Aluminum Tariffs Shake The Markets","Steel and aluminum stocks are popping on Thursday while the rest of the market crashes after President Donald Trump said he will be announcing new steel and aluminum tariffs as early as next week. What You Need To Know Trump said Thursday the U.S. will implement a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports, but didn't specify whether the tariffs will be applied to all imports or just imports from specific countries. “People have no idea how badly our country has been treated by other countries,” Trump said. “By people representing up who didn’t have a clue.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 500 points Thursday afternoon, sitting around the 24,500 level at time of publication. The S&P 500 slid about 43 points. Why It’s Important The new metal tariffs are on the high end of what some analysts expected after the U.S. Commerce Department recommended a 24-percent tariff earlier this month. Back in January, Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on imported panels, most of which are coming from Asia. China, which is the largest international U.S. trade partner, is a major importer of both steel and solar panels. Politicians in both the EU and China have already threatened to retaliate against the U.S. if Trump implements import tariffs. The EU has said it's prepared to act “swiftly and appropriately” to restrictive U.S. trade measures by potentially implementing its own restrictions on U.S. exports such as bourbon, cheese, orange juice tomatoes and potatoes. EU officials could also reportedly target iconic American brands, such as Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG). China is also reportedly already prepping for a trade war, investigating the possibility of restricting U.S. grain imports. What’s Next Investors will now be watching and waiting for further details on the new tariffs and any indication the market sell-off could soften Trump’s stance. In the meantime, Height Securities said on Thursday the steel tariffs are great news for U.S. steel stocks, potentially providing support for domestic prices and increasing profitability. “It is possible that Trump could use this meeting to confirm his commitment to taking strong action, especially on steel tariffs, and we expect that headlines will be positive for the affected steel companies,” Height said prior to Trump's announcement. Here’s a rundown of how steel and aluminum stocks reacted to the news on Thursday: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was up 7.6 percent. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) was up 4.2 percent. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) was up 10.9 percent. Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) was up 1.7 percent. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) was up 2.4 percent. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was down 1.0 percent.

2018-03-02,"Trump's Steel Tariffs Are Stronger Than The Market Expected, Says Longbow Analyst","President Donald Trump’s decision to enact a 25-percent tariff on imported steel took the market by surprise Thursday and left analysts scrambling to update their outlook for U.S. steel stocks. The Analyst Longbow Research analyst Chris Olin reiterated Buy ratings for the following four steel stocks and adjusted the price targets as follows: Protectionist policies were already baked into steel stock prices and earnings outlooks, but Trump’s decision to opt for a 25-percent tariff was more aggressive than the market was anticipating, Olin said in a Friday note. Despite a recent run-up in steel stocks, the latest news leaves room for further upside, the analyst said. “We still expect steel mills to benefit from rapid upward spot price movement throughout 2018 with a higher-than-expected floor in 2019,” Olin said. As a result, he said Wall Street earnings estimates will need to be adjusted much higher in the coming days. Longbow is valuing U.S. steel stocks using a long-term HRC price range of between $750 and $775/ton. However, Olin expects prices to range between $850 and $875 per ton by the second quarter. Olin made the following adjustments to his 2019 EPS projections: Nucor raised from $1.75 to $7.33. Steel Dynamics raised from $1.03 to $5. U.S. Steel raised from $2.15 to $7.27. AK Steel raised from 24 cents to $1.25. Price Action The prices of all four steel stocks surged between 3 and 10 percent Thursday following Trump’s announcement.

2018-03-20,Goldman Sachs Initiates On A Slew Of Metal and Mining Stocks,"Goldman Sachs initiated bullish coverage on the metals and mining space, but the firm said investors still need to be selective about which stocks to buy. The Analyst Goldman analyst Matthew Korn set the following ratings and price targets for metals and mining stocks: Initiated Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) with a Buy rating and $23 target. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) with a Buy rating and $78 target. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) with a Buy rating and $59 target. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) with a Buy rating and $42 target. Constellium NV (NYSE:CSTM) with a Buy rating and $16 target. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) with a Sell rating and $25 target. Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:ATI) with a Sell rating and $26 target. The Thesis Overall fundamentals in the North American mining and metals markets are very strong, Korn said. “Commodity prices are high, the supply side for metals and bulks looks more rational than it has been in years, M&M balance sheets are healthy (or at least healthier), and consumption has momentum from coordinated global growth, even as China gradually slows,” Korn said in the note. Korn said copper is the most attractive metal for Goldman at the moment, and Feeport McMoRan has the most copper exposure of the names mentioned. In addition, Korn said U.S. steel mills are expanding capacity with the support of new trade policy and aluminum demand is strong driven by a booming transportation industry. Price Action Here’s a look at how the stocks now covered by Goldman were following the initiation Tuesday: Freeport McMoRan was up 2.1 percent. Nucor was up 0.6 percent. Steel Dynamics was up 0.2 percent. Schnitzer was up 1.3 percent. Constellium was up 1.9 percent. Commercial Metals was down 0.4 percent. Allegheny Technologies was down 1.2 percent.

2018-06-19,"BofA Downgrades Commercial Metals On Supply, Valuation Concerns","Since hitting a low of $19.65 on April 5, shares of Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) have gained about 23 percent, prompting Bank of America Merrill Lynch to revisit its rating on the equity. The Analyst Analyst Timna Tanners downgraded Commercial Metals from Neutral to Underperform and lowered the price target from $24 to $23. The Thesis Commercial Metals' valuation already reflects its much better-than-normal earnings power and its proposed plan to acquire four Gerdau U.S. rebar mills that's scheduled to close by the end of the year, Tanners said in a Tuesday note. (See the analyst's track record here.) On the downside, the analyst projects potential antitrust challenges to the Gerdau deal due to excess concentration, as imports now face a 25-percent Section 232 tariff, Tanners said. Taking into account the weakness of the Turkish lira — which is down 24 percent year-to-date — the price of imported rebar has dropped, resulting in a $125/ton discount to U.S. prices even after tariffs were applied, the analyst said. BofA expects U.S. rebar imports to rebound in Q4 after a summer dip, along with additional volume from Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD). The U.S. rebar market was oversupplied before the Trump administration's tariffs, Tanners said. Utilization remains below 80 percent, indicating limited pricing power, the analyst said. In recent midquarter updates on peers NUE and STLD we revisit valuation to use 'normal' multiples on conservative benchmark hot rolled coil and still find upside. BofA prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics to Commercial Metals. The Price Action Commercial Metals shares were down 3.86 percent at $23.15 at the time of publication Tuesday afternoon.

2018-07-24,Nucor Upgraded On U.S. Infrastructure Spending Prospects,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) traded higher Tuesday after one Street analyst gave the stock his vote of approval. The Analyst KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Philip Gibbs upgraded Nucor from Sector Weight to Overweight and and set a $77 price target. The Thesis Self-help growth initiatives in fabrication and raw materials will provide Nucor with more of an earnings boost in 2019 than previously anticipated, Gibbs said in the upgrade note. (See the analyst's track record here.) KeyBanc raised its 2018 EPS forecast from $4.68 to $5.40. “Further, company-specific drivers could add 20 percent to our EPS power view over time, while visible FCFE momentum [$3.3 billion from the second half of 2018 to 2019] and optionality to any nascent pickup in infrastructure spending provide further upside potential, the analyst said. Steel growth projects, stock buybacks and other drivers could push 2019 EPS as high as $6.50 and KeyBanc’s price target as high as $85, Gibbs said. KeyBanc is targeting 2019 steel prices of $675/ton for HRC. Nucor’s pristine balance sheet is only getting stronger, Gibbs said. Attention will slowly shift away from trade war uncertainty back to Nucor’s organic growth pipeline and a potential boost from U.S. infrastructure spending, in KeyBanc's view. The Trump administration’s top priority is the trade war, but that attention could soon shift to domestic infrastructure, Gibbs said; roughly half of Nucor’s demand comes from nonresidential construction spending. KeyBanc is predicting that Nucor will top consensus EPS and revenue expectations in the second quarter. Price Action Nucor shares were trading 2.68 percent higher at $68.51 at the time of publication Tuesday.

2018-07-27,"A Running List Of The Companies Blaming Trade Policy For Stifled Earnings, Guidance","The Trump administration's trade decisions seem to be the theme of the quarter. Of the first 146 S&P 500 companies to report second-quarter earnings, more than 40 percent mentioned tariffs on their conference calls, according to CNBC. While Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) celebrated the positive impact of trade policy on finished steel and ore, most corporations lamented the tariffs. Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS), for example, warned of “just how terrible” a tariff or trade war would be. Here's a roundup of companies that attributed poor earnings, weak guidance or headwind expectations to the Trump trade approach. General Motors General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) missed earnings-per-share estimates while beating sales forecasts. Management said rising steel and aluminum prices most significantly challenged margins and forced a guidance cut. “We were very much on track to delivering that 10-percent [margin] expectation until some of these commodity price impacts started to build as we got into the second quarter and as we extrapolate that throughout the year,” CFO Chuck Stevens said on a media call, noting an indirect impact through suppliers. “ ... At least as we think about 2018, the primary drivers are index commodities, and about 30 to 35 percent of our raw materials index, so as prices go up, that's an automatic pass-through.” Stevens said that, in GM’s model, tariffs aren’t expected to impact the U.S. auto industry this year. Yet non-tariff actions could trickle down. China’s devaluation of the renminbi, seen to be a direct response to U.S. trade policy, was cited by GM as suppressive to China results. Fiat Chrysler Citing similar trouble in China, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (NYSE:FCAU) reported a year-over-year decline in its bottom line despite improving sales and shipments. It also trimmed full-year sales guidance. “[We're] not overly concerned today, but we obviously need to keep an eye on commodity prices as we move into 2019,” CFO Richard Palmer said in a conference call. FCA is developing contingency plans to diminish the impact of tariffs. Ford Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) missed bottom-line estimates despite a revenue beat. Duties hurt the automaker’s China business, and CFO Bob Shanks said on an analyst call that tariffs, particularly those on steel and aluminum imports, should cost Ford $1.6 billion in North America this year. Notably, immediately after the trio reported earnings, Trump struck a deal with the European Union not to raise tariffs on cars or trucks. Stanley Black & Decker Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) reported sizable beats in its top- and bottom-lines but predicted steel, aluminum and Chinese import tariffs would create a $35-million headwind in 2018. We have initiated price increases for these implemented tariffs and look to further mitigate the remaining impact via the formal exclusion process where applicable,” CFO Donald Allan Jr. said on the earnings call. “ ... Prior to mitigating actions, we estimate the annual impact to be approximately $70 million to $80 million. Therefore, if you assume, and it is an assumption, a Sept. 1 implementation, the 2018 impact could be approximately $25 million. 3M 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) missed revenue forecasts and lowered the upper end of its full-year bottom-line guidance, but exceeded EPS expectations. CFO Nick Gangestad said tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese imports, although a “fairly immaterial impact,” will cost the company about $10 million on an annualized basis. On the price of raw materials, we are likely seeing that our commodity prices and the increases we're seeing — they're likely at a peak level, Gangestad said. Our selling price projections are consistent with that, and that's part of our anticipation that, in a more stable world going forward with commodities, we'll continue to have our selling prices more than offset what we're now seeing for commodity price increases. PPG Industries PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) not only posted in-line EPS and a sales beat but also raised its dividend. Nonetheless, it conceded a cost impact from commodity price increases. “In particular, we are closely monitoring our business in China for any possible impacts,” CEO Michael McGarry said on the earnings call. “Currently, the new tariffs are starting to add some modest cost to our raw materials.” Alcoa Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) similarly beat estimates, no thanks to the $15-million in tariff costs imposed on imports from its Canadian and other foreign processing operations. Management cut annual EBITDA expectations, citing a $12 million to $14 million monthly cost impact from aluminum tariffs. ConocoPhillips ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) beat bottom-line estimates and raised 2018 production guidance, but management said steel tariffs are becoming a “fairly significant” cost that will impact capital spending next year. Danaher Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) surpassed second-quarter expectations and raised full-year EPS guidance, but management factored in a slight headwind from tariffs. “There is no one business at Danaher that has a significant impact, but it's a bunch of little impact across all the businesses and that adds up to that roughly sort of 1-cent-a-quarter impact,” CFO Daniel Comas said on the earnings call. General Electric General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) beat top- and bottom-line estimates but intimated that, with 10 percent of its $29 billion in imports coming from China, and $7 billion in revenue dependent on China, its exposure to the trade war could eventually cause harm. We don't see a major impact yet financially, certainly not on our 2018 guidance, CEO John Flannery said in his earnings call. We have a massively global business in every sense, both with the customers, supply chains, everything. W.W. Grainger W W Grainger Inc (NYSE:GWW) beat estimates and raised projections, but anticipates trade-related cost increases. We expect that we will see some supplier inflation related to tariffs in the second half, and we are confident in our ability to pass on price increases,” CFO Thomas Okray said on the earnings call. Kimberly Clark Kimberly Clark Corp (NYSE:KMB) beat EPS forecasts while missing revenue estimates and slicing its annual bottom-line and net sales guidance. Management blamed $200 million in higher raw material costs. “When you have a commodity impact as large and as significant as it is right now, I think our customers understand that,” CFO Maria Henry told analysts. Intuitive Surgical Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) beat top- and bottom-line estimates, although management qualitatively guided for a tariff-related hit that the company will absorb. “We think that the estimated impact will be modest in terms of the increase in product cost for our systems,” CFO Marshall Mohr said on the call. “That's not a cost or a level that we're going to pass any of those costs on to customers at this point in time. Coca-Cola The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) beat estimates but, partially due to increased metal prices, said it is raising prices on sodas in North America and foresees bottlers and retailers passing the increases to consumers. Illinois Tool Works Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) achieved in-line EPS but missed sales estimates and issued full-year guidance below expectations. Management said tariffs represent between 10 percent and 15 percent of total projected cost inflation for 2018. Union Pacific Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) exceeded earnings estimates but acknowledged tariffs as a hindrance. “We have seen some very specific impacts on us, but they're pretty granular, right?” CEO Lance Fritz said on the earnings call. “Inbound on some rail that we buy from Japan, there was a substantial 25-percent tariff on the last boat that was received. And then we've seen some other discrete impacts on customers. Harley-Davidson Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE:HOG) beat revenue and EPS estimates but lowered its full-year operating-margin projections from between 9.5 and 10.5 percent to between 9 percent and 10 percent. The first half of the year saw 14.4-percent margins. As a result of the recently enacted tariffs, we expect to incur approximately $45 million to $55 million of increased costs,” CFO John Olin said on an analyst call. “This includes incremental costs of approximately $15 million to $20 million for steel and aluminum, and approximately $30 million to $35 million for EU tariffs.” McDonald’s Mcdonalds Corp (NYSE:MCD) beat estimates and reported a 4-percent comps increase, but CEO Steve Easterbrook suggested that “uncertainty of trade discussions” is contributing to negative consumer counts in China restaurants. Whirlpool Whirlpool Corporation (NYSE:WHR) missed both top- and bottom-line estimates and cut guidance well below forecasts. Tariffs were seen to weigh on margins and inspire an increase in 2018 guidance for raw material costs from $300 million to $350 million. Global steel cost has risen substantially and, particularly in the U.S., they have reached unexplainable levels, CEO Marc Bitzer said during the firm's earnings call. ... Uncertainty related to tariffs and global trade actions have also led to increased costs for certain strategic components and finished goods imports and exports.” United Tech United Technologies Corporation (NYSE:UTX) reported beats across the board and even raised guidance, but it also reported higher costs attributable to tariffs. Tariffs on steel, aluminum and Chinese imports stifled the firm’s EPS guidance raise by 5 cents. Anticipating an increase in steel and aluminum tariffs, CEO Gregory Hayes said 2019 will see a “much bigger impact” as the firm books commodities six to nine months in advance.

2018-10-11,Seaport Global Says The Steel Industry Is Due For A Bounce,"Steel stocks have been in focus in 2018 after the steel industry was one of the first to be dragged into the global trade war. Steel stocks have run out of steam in recent months, but one analyst says the steel industry is due for a bounce. The Analyst On Thursday, Seaport Global analyst Derek Hernandez initiated coverage of the following five steel stocks: Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) - Buy rating, $75 price target. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) - Buy rating, $55 price target. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) - Buy rating, $35 price target. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) - Neutral rating, $5 price target. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) - Neutral rating, $20 price target. The Thesis U.S. policy uncertainty and recent declines in forward steel pricing have outweighed the bullish outlook for long-term global steel demand as of late. “Despite elevated earnings in 2018, valuations have pulled back significantly in recent months as doubt and insecurity have followed the year’s early exuberance. We view this pullback as an opportunity to buy market leaders,” Hernandez wrote in the note. Hernandez expects the Trump administration to continue to support the U.S. steel industry via Section 232 tariffs through at least 2020, despite investor concerns that an end to the Section 232 tariffs are always only a tweet away. While Hernandez says the steel tariffs are certainly on the table as a trade war bargaining chip, Trump would likely replace the tariffs with quotas in the event he agrees to drop them. While Hernandez is bullish on the U.S. steel space overall, he said Nucor is his top stock pick given its strong balance sheet, organic growth initiatives and potential for acquisitions.

2018-10-15,"Credit Suisse Downgrades American Steel Sector On Supply, Interest Rate Concerns","The volatile steel sector has yet to obtain the stamp of approval from sell-side firms despite expectations that President Donald Trump's tariffs could lend support. Ahead of the third-quarter reporting season, Credit Suisse downgraded the U.S. steel sector from Overweight to Market Weight. The Analyst Analyst Curt Woodworth has the following ratings and price targets for some of the steel and mining stocks in Credit Suisse's coverage universe: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X): Maintained Outperform/price target reduced from $48 to $40. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target reduced from $77 to $74. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target reduced from $55 to $51. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF): Downgraded from Outperform to Neutral/price target increased from $11 to $13. AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS): Maintained Outperform/price target increased from $6 to $7. The Thesis Increasing supply into the sheet market and concerns over rising interest rates that are hurting demand are the twin reasons behind Credit Suisse's downgrade of the steel sector, Woodworth said in a Monday note. (See his track record here.) Even as additional capacity is expected to come online from U.S. Steel, ArcelorMittal SA (NYSE:MT) and others, domestic steel production recently hit a four-year high, the analyst said, citing AISI data. Production rates are up by an annualized 6 metric tons, he said. At the same time, HRC prices continued to slide, Woodworth said. Credit Suisse also sees risks stemming from a potential rollback of tariffs due to the likelihood of the U.S. and Canada's NAFTA deal winning approval in early 2019. Electric arc furnace capacity expansions are expected to flood the market by 2020-21, according to Credit Suisse. The firm also expects downstream rolling capacity to ramp up in 2019-20. Capital allocation by steel companies has disappointed relative to investors' wish lists, Woodworth said. The analyst noted a surge in capex in 2018 — with the possibility of more to come in 2019 — and an increase in M&A activity. Although the analyst is in favor of a higher internal rate of return growth spend, he said the companies should have more balanced capital returns. The pace of share buybacks could also disappoint, Woodworth said. These factors could temper investor excitement in the sector, limiting the potential for multiple expansion given the peak margins and cycle fears, the analyst said. Credit Suisse's upbeat stance on U.S. Steel and AK Steel is due to expectations for upside to Street estimates for those companies on the basis of better 2019 contract pricing and more attractive valuations relative to historical forward multiples, Woodworth said. The Price Action The VANECK VECTORS/STL ETF (NYSE:SLX) was up 0.38 percent at $44.37 at the time of publication Monday.

2018-11-27,Steel Stocks Have Wall Street's Attention,"The U.S. steel industry has had a volatile couple of years with fluctuations in steel prices and uncertainty surrounding the fate of steel tariffs in an ongoing trade war. This week, several Wall Street analysts weighed in on steel stocks ahead of the G20 summit of world leaders. New Steel Mill After Monday's market close, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) announced plans to build a new $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion electric-arc-furnace (EAF) carbon sheet steel mill in the U.S. KeyBanc analyst Philip Gibbs said Steel Dynamics investors may have mixed feelings about the new mill. “U.S. carbon sheet-based stocks will likely be weaker tomorrow on the potential for further U.S. supply growth, while STLD investors may be a bit disappointed via potential for less bandwidth to pursue full-out share buyback momentum ($729M left at September's end),” Gibbs wrote in a note. Gibbs said the prospect of more steel supply in the U.S. market will likely weigh on steel prices and maintains a Sector Weight rating for Steel Dynamics stock. Steel Price Forecast On Tuesday, Longbow Research lowered its 2019 HRC steel spot price target by $10 to $15/ton and is now calling for 2019 prices to range between $790 and $795/ton. The new target represents roughly 5 percent downside from 2018 average prices. Despite the bearish adjustment, Longbow analyst Chris Olin reiterated his Buy rating and $40 price target for U.S. Steel (NYSE:X). “We believe the shares are significantly undervalued, even after adjusting for potential market headwinds,” Olin said. Sentiment Falling UBS analyst Andreas Bokkenheuser said net sentiment for the steel group declined in the third quarter. “Average Net Sentiment for all producers remained above global peers (possibly on account of Section 232 support), but directionally still down. We note that Net Sentiment serves as a potential leading indicator for operational performance,” Bokkenheuser wrote in a note. He said U.S. Steel has the highest net sentiment in the quarter, followed by Steel Dynamics, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS). UBS has the following ratings and price targets for the U.S. steel group: Nucor: Neutral, $63 target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral, $48 target. U.S. Steel: Sell, $28 target. AK Steel: Sell, $3.25 target.

2018-12-18,Large 3PLs break into frothy Memphis headhaul market,"Long considered an asset stronghold, Memphis welcomes big brokerages Small and midsize brokers still find Memphis market difficult If you're a broker who wants to play in the Memphis freight market, you'd better come with capacity at scale and a willingness to feel some pain in order to build long-term, meaningful relationships. That's what we've been hearing from brokers at Trident, Avenger, Redwood, and Echo (NASDAQ:ECHO). There's a huge volume of freight outbound from Memphis, but until recently large asset-based carriers like JB Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT), Schneider (NYSE:SNDR), Werner (NASDAQ:WERN), and Knight-Swift Transportation (NYSE:KNX) have had the market locked up. Only in the past few years have major 3PLs made headway with high-volume shippers, and small brokerages still don't feel welcome. Memphis, Tennessee is one of the strongest headhaul markets in the country, consistently producing more outbound freight than it takes in. Even though it's not a major market in terms of absolute volume—Memphis tenders about a third of the loads that Atlanta does—the imbalance between inbound and outbound freight is roughly equivalent to Los Angeles. But why? SONAR's headhaul index measures the balance between outbound and inbound freight for any given market: it's calculated each day by simply subtracting inbound volume from outbound volume. Memphis (HAUL.MEM) scored a 63.08 last Friday; for reference, Los Angeles (HAUL.LAX) was at 63.51 and Chicago (HAUL.CHI) posted a 45.43. The higher the score, the more outbound freight a market has compared to inbound. Memphis is one of the most lopsided freight markets in the country. (Map: FreightWaves SONAR) The lopsided freight flows in and out of Memphis mean that shippers have to pay more to secure outbound capacity. You can see how Memphis' high headhaul score puts capacity at a premium by comparing it to another market like New Orleans (HAUL.MSY), which has a headhaul score of 12. According to DAT's RateView tool, over the past seven days dry vans from Memphis to Atlanta brought in $2.29/mile net of fuel, while the rate from New Orleans to Atlanta averaged only $1.71/mile net of fuel. Those lanes have maintained a fairly stable 50-60 ct/mile spread. What makes Memphis such an important source of trucking freight? There are two major factors: transportation infrastructure and large shippers. Five of North America's Class 1 railroads meet in Memphis: CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), BNSF (NYSE:BRK), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), and Canadian National (NYSE:CNI). That junction has made Memphis the third largest rail hub in the country after Chicago and St. Louis. There are also a number of very large shippers, from steel manufacturers like Nucor (NYSE:NUE) and Big River Steel to International Paper (NYSE:IP). FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) headquarters in Memphis also makes it a destination for e-commerce shippers who move high-value product and who need large quality carriers they can trust. Nike (NYSE:NKE) has 2.5M square feet of distribution center space in the market; Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) has more than 1M square feet in nearby Olive Branch. Those needs have tended to put a damper on small and midsize brokerages looking for an entry point into the market. There's so much freight coming out, but from a brokerage standpoint it's very difficult, admitted Carter Garret, VP at Trident Transport. We don't have a lot of leverage… at the end of the day Memphis is an asset stronghold due in part to the rail spur. You have a lot of trucking companies in the area, and they have good relationships with those shippers and dominate the freight going back in. We've never been able to establish a strong presence there, said Rush Feldhacker, VP of Sales at Trident. I've never seen anybody have a great brokerage set up of any size there. It's one of those areas where you don't try to compete that much because you're at a disadvantage; you're just not able to compete on price. Spot rates on outbound Memphis are inflated—it's difficult to get a truck for a reasonable price. Don't miss it. Register today. An executive at another Chattanooga-based brokerage agreed, and also said that working with the railroads was difficult for asset-light providers. The other challenge from a brokerage standpoint is the rail, said Jason Roberts, Director of Business Development at Avenger Logistics. In my experience, we have a big challenge trying to handle business coming in and out of the rail yards, because the rail has very specific requirements as to who can and cannot come into the yard. They want our MC number on the truck and there's extra registration involved for each yard. I had to get a truck driver to put a piece of cardboard with our MC number on the side of his truck just to get into the rail yard. Memphis has been a well-priced headhaul market for a long time, Roberts said, and carriers strategically allocated assets to the area. Price isn't what keeps us out, Roberts said. The previously established relationships with the current customer base that's there is what keeps us from really being able to put a dent in it. The challenge for the brokerage is how do you establish that same relationship and fill that value proposition to those customers who are already doing business with those carriers, Roberts said. It's about pushing out carriers who aren't based in Memphis into that area more often—and we have to rely on the business being there in order to sell the same piece to our trucks going into that market. Two larger Chicago-based brokerages said they have had more success convincing big shippers to give them freight. My view of Memphis is that it's an extremely strong secondary market, said Christopher Thornycroft, SVP of Operations at Redwood Logistics. It's not by volume the same as Chicago, Atlanta, or Los Angeles—it's different in that way, but it's so sustainable because it's the largest DC network in the country. Therefore you have carriers who have a heavy stream of regular freight, plus a just-in-time market that establishes itself. Redwood has more than 200 active carriers out of Memphis proper, Thornycroft said, and forty of those are designated as ‘strong relationships.' It's a market that gets impacted by produce, by retail, even by back-to-school, Thornycroft added. If there is a market out there, it touches Memphis. That does make it more difficult for some brokers to get involved, because you've got to have some skin in the game. A pricing algorithm is going to expose you to loss and you have to be able to hang on and grit your teeth, especially in the beginning years. It's a game of figuring out what don't [asset-based carriers] want, and if that's the case, it has its difficulties as well. But where there's pain, there's often opportunity, Thornycroft said. Adam Markman, Division VP at Echo Global Logistics, said that since about 2014 supply chain managers at large shippers have begun changing how they think about their transportation needs. Flexibility and creativity are now considered paramount, which has been a boon to 3PLs with access to lots of capacity. Supply chain managers say ‘this is how it was last year, not sure how it's gonna be this year,' Markman said. There can be multiple swings based on pricing and seasonality and some challenges based on shippers and relationships, but as the market has evolved over the last couple years, we've done well. There are larger corporations and shippers in Memphis who control a lot of the capacity, so you have to make adjustments based on that, Markman said, noting that 3PLs had a role to play on weekends and fulfilling otherwise difficult load/unload times.

2019-01-28,"Morgan Stanley Upgrades US Steel, Sees Near-Term Bounce In Steel Prices","Steel stocks have taken a beating in the past year, but one Wall Street analyst said Monday a seasonal ramp in U.S. steel demand should help boost prices in the near-term. The Analyst Morgan Stanley analyst Piyush Sood made the following changes to his steel coverage: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) downgraded from Overweight to Equal-Weight, price target cut from $5 to $3. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) upgraded from Underweight to Equal-Weight, price target cut from $30 to $21. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $10.50 to $10. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $26 to $21. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) reiterated at Equal-Weight, price target cut from $73 to $62. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) reiterated at Underweight, price target cut from $26 to $22. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Overweight, price target cut from $52 to $42. The Thesis Market dynamics should stabilize steel prices and most steel stocks in the first half of 2019, Sood said. However, he wouldn’t be surprised to see downward pressure on steel prices resume in the second half of the year. “As tariffs are eased further in 2019 and supply/imports increase, steel prices will once again come under pressure, beginning in 2H19,” Sood wrote in a note. He said buyers have mostly stayed on the sidelines in recent in anticipation of lower prices down the road. That dynamic drove hot rolled coil steel prices down from a peak of $920/t in summer 2018 to recent levels of between $640/t and $690/t. Morgan Stanley forecasts late Q1 and Q2 HRC prices of around $700/t driven in part by China stimulus demand. In the longer term, the firm is forecasting 2020 and 2021 HRC prices of $660/t and $640/t, respectively. Price Action Here’s how the steel stocks mentioned reacted to the new commentary Monday: U.S. Steel was down 0.1 percent. Steel Dynamics was down 0.4 percent. Schnitzer Steel was down 2.4 percent. Nucor was down 1.2 percent. Commercial Metals was down 1.1 percent. Cleveland Cliffs was down 1.9 percent. A.K. Steel was down 6.4 percent.

Nucor President, CEO and Chairman John Ferrigola described the location of the new plate mill as strategic in a January 7 call with investors, noting its close proximity to scrap metal yards in the Midwest, as well as to a large portion of Nucor's customer base. This investment will enable us to build a clear market leadership position in the U.S. plate market, Ferriola said. Our acquisition of the Gallatin sheet mill in Ghent, Kentucky five years ago has been a tremendous success, and we are pleased to add a second mill in the state. According to Ferrigola, proximity to customers will allow for better service and better on-time delivery. In 2017, the midwestern United States accounted for the largest demand for steel at 1.8 million tons. The Southeast and South Central regions were close behind at 1.4 million tons and 1.25 million tons, respectively. The North Carolina and Alabama plate mills produce a combined 2.9 million tons of steel plate annually. The new Kentucky mill will be capable of producing 1.2 million tons of steel annually, while cutting down on shipping costs and capitalizing on an abundance of nearby scrap metal used in its recycling business. Nucor Corporation is North America's largest producer and recycler of steel and steel products and employs more than 25,000 throughout the United States and Canada. The company reported record net earnings of $2.36 billion and shipped record amounts of steel in 2018. The trend may very well continue after completion of the new Kentucky mill, as the new steel mill in Brandenburg will translate to hundreds of loads shipping per day from that facility, as well as loads of scrap metal shipping inbound to be melted down for recycling. It is difficult to estimate the load count per day that will ship from the new Brandenburg mill, according to a source at Nucor's Tuscaloosa, Alabama, site. Loads will ship via rail, barge and truckload daily. Load volumes will be consistent month-to-month. Though the location of the mill has been described as strategic, it is too soon to tell what challenges Nucor may experience in terms of truckload capacity in that area. The rust belt is tight enough, explained a flatbed expert at a Chattanooga brokerage. When you come that far south, what you're doing is extending the rust belt, stretching it into a bigger size. That's going to be tough on capacity. Though it's location on the Ohio River is ideal for transporting bulk shipments of scrap metal, sourcing flatbed capacity may prove to be difficult. Louisville is located between the Indianapolis and Nashville markets, both of which provide many options for flatbed drivers, especially in peak construction seasons. The mill will not be operational until 2022, but will likely provide plenty of job site freight during its construction. Nucor's new plate mill will produce cut-to-length, coiled, heat-treated and discrete plate ranging from 60 to 160 inches wide, and in gauges from 3/16 of an inch to 14 inches. The Brandenburg mill will strengthen Nucor's plate product portfolio significantly, and give the company the ability to produce speciality plate products that generate higher margins. Nucor's new mill will allow the company to produce 97 percent of the steel plate in demand in the United States, something only one other domestic steel producer has accomplished. Nucor acquired Gallatin Steel Co. from Gerdau SA and ArcelorMittal in 2014 for approximately $780 million. In 2018, Nucor announced a $165 million, 70-job expansion to the Ghent facility, planning to nearly double its capacity for rolled steel. The facility is undergoing two major investment projects, including a new galvanizing line and a project to increase its hot rolled coil capacity. The new galvanizing line is expected to be operational during the second quarter of 2019, and the plant's hot rolled capacity is expected to increase by 2021. The new Brandenburg facility, as well as the Gallatin expansions, represent over $2 billion in investments by Nucor in Kentucky. The new mill will also generate as many as 2,000 construction jobs before it is fully operational. Nucor was founded in 1955 by Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile, when he left his company following a stockholder dispute. Olds formed REO Motor Co., a company which evolved into the Nuclear Corporation of America and eventually became Nucor in 1971. Today, the company is comprised of three segments including steel mills, steel products and raw materials. Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe Permalink"
2019-04-11,Bank Of America Gives US Steel A Double Downgrade As Steel Prices Soften,"U.S. steel pricing is not where analysts had anticipated this spring, and one analyst says lower steel prices are bad news for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). The Analyst Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners downgraded U.S. Steel from Buy to Underperform and cut her price target from $31 to $18. The Thesis Steel prices typically peak during the spring season, but Bank of America’s latest pricing checks indicate hot rolled coil prices recently hit their lows for the year. Despite higher international iron ore prices, scrap prices dropped $25/t in April from March levels. Tanners says without a solid pricing environment, it will be very difficult for U.S. Steel to gain any traction in the market. “Our X downgrade reflects a view that without a near-term pricing catalyst, shares face headwinds from anticipated cash burn of $150-200M for 2019E-2021E amid elevated capex needs,” Tanners wrote in a note. U.S. steel typically prices between $50 and $100/t above landed import prices, but mills have recently been pricing sheets at or below import prices. After meeting with steel buyers, Tanners said U.S. mills are competing for market share by oversupplying the market and driving prices down. Bank of America cut its 2019 HRC price estimate from $730/t to $699/t, including a price forecast of $710/t in the second quarter. Tanners says given the difficult environment, she much prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD) over U.S. Steel given their near-term cash flow outlook. Price Action Following the downgrade and additional downgrade from Credit Suisse on Tuesday, U.S. Steel shares are down 15.8 percent on the week. The stock traded around $16.80 at time of publication.

2019-05-17,"Reports: US Set To Drop Steel And Aluminum Tariffs On Mexico, Canada","The United States is planning to lift steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada, clearing the way for ratification of the so-called United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, the replacement for NAFTA, according to a Bloomberg report. The industry reacted to the report with stocks spiking higher for several U.S. steel and aluminum producers. What To Know Bloomberg cited unnamed sources as saying the tariffs will be dropped, with federal officials instead taking a stronger stance on enforcement, opening the door to ratification of USMCA. According to the report, officials are still trying to work out a key issue of an effective date for removing the tariffs. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley of Iowa said in an Instagram Post earlier this week that if it was true that talks were closing in on lifting the tariffs, it would go a long way to opening the door to completion of the trade deal. Stocks Move While these stocks did trade higher after Bloomberg's report first hit, shares were still in the red for the day. Shares of U.S. aluminum company Alcoa Corp. (NYSE:AA) were down 1.12 percent to $24.70, while United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) was down 1.78 percent to $14.60 and Timkensteel Corp (NYSE:TMST) was down 3.38 percent to $8.58.

2019-05-31,Bank Of America Double Downgrades Nucor Ahead Of 'Steelmageddon',"On May 14, U.S. President Donald Trump credited hit tariffs on imported steel with rebuilding the U.S. steel industry, which he said is now “booming.” However, shares of North Carolina steel producer Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) are down 25.9 percent in the past year, and one analyst double downgraded the stock on Friday. The Analyst Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners downgraded Nucor from Buy to Underperform and lowered her price target from $68 to $50. Tanners also made the following price target changes to steel stocks under her coverage: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $1 to $1. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $18 to $13. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $98 to $90. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $40 to $30. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) reiterated at Underperform, target dropped from $12 to $8. The Thesis Tanners said Nucor will likely be one of the first victims of what she calls a “steelmageddon” supply glut that will persist through 2021. As a result of oversupply concerns, Bank of America cut its 2022 benchmark hot rolled coil steel price forecast from $590/ton to just $475/ton. “Given a worse 2019E price view, risks of peak demand, and a looming supply glut in 2020-2021E, we see limited catalysts for the group and expect little incrementally positive from its June 20 investor day,” Tanners wrote in the note. Tanners said the supply glut will hurt all U.S. steel companies, but Steel Dynamics will be most immune given its attractive valuation, strong balance sheet, and near-term expansion opportunities. Price Action Nucor shares traded lower by 2.7 percent to $47.94 on Friday.

2019-06-04,Goldman Sachs Downgrades US Steel To Sell,"For the second time in a week, a Wall Street analyst has downgraded a major U.S. steel stock. This time, it’s United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) on the chopping block. The Analyst Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Korn downgraded U.S. Steel from Neutral to Sell and lowered his price target from $17 to $11. Korn also made the following adjustments to his steel price targets: AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS) reiterated at Sell, target dropped from $2.25 to $1.50. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $96 to $93. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $44 to $36. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) reiterated at Buy, target dropped from $70 to $59. Stelco Holdings Inc (OTC:STZHF) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from C$18 TO C$17. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:SCHN) reiterated at Neutral, target dropped from $27 to $25. The Thesis Less than a week after Bank of America downgraded Nucor, Korn said Tuesday weakening demand and plentiful supply are creating a drag on steel prices that will weigh on the steel stock group. “Weakening demand crossed with stubbornly high output from domestic mills has dragged steel sheet prices down to their lowest levels since 2016, and recent moves by the Trump Administration to weaken the Section 232 tariffs have contributed to expectations of ample available supply in the US market,” Korn wrote in a note. For U.S. steel specifically, Korn said lower steel prices will likely lead to additional earnings cuts and could even put pressure on the company’s bloated balance sheet. U.S. Steel recently announced a $1.2 billion investment in its Mon Valley Works facility that is being funded almost entirely by new debt. Korn is projecting $1.5 billion per year in capex for U.S. Steel from 2019 through 2021 versus just $645 million per year in operating cash generation. Price Action U.S. Steel shares traded around $12.78 at time of publication.

2019-09-04,Bank Of America Cuts Steel Earnings Estimates Across The Board,"Bank of America has cut its forecast for U.S. steel prices and dialed back its earnings expectations for American steel stocks across the board. On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners cut her price target for U.S. hot-rolled coil in the second half of 2019 from $628 per short ton to $572. Tanners also issued the following 2019 EPS cuts for popular U.S. steel stocks: Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) cut from $2.05 to $1.95. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) cut from to $4.65 to $4.60. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) cut from $9.20 to $8.99. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) cut from $3.25 to $3.19. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) cut from 79 cents to 75 cents. “On Q2 calls, mills were constructive on demand improving in H2E, but we see risk of weaker volumes and prices, based on our channel checks and recent macro data,” Tanners wrote in a note. No Major Catalysts Ahead Fortunately, Tanners said steel prices could find some near-term support from planned maintenance outages at major mills in coming months. While lower imports would theoretically boost domestic demand, Tanners said many buyers loaded up on inventory after producers announced price hikes over the summer. She said slowing economic growth in China also runs the risk of flooding the market with excess steel given China increased its production by 10% in the first half of the year. Looking ahead, Tanners remains pessimistic about the steel group given more supply cuts are likely in the cards. Bank of America’s top picks in the group are Neutral-rated Reliance and Steel Dynamics. Benzinga’s Take A Neutral rating is far from a vote of confidence. Buying shares of Reliance or Steel Dynamics at this stage would be akin to buying the best house in a bad neighborhood. Investors may want to consider steering clear of steel until the market shows signs of improvement. Do you agree with this take? Email feedback@benzinga.com with your thoughts.

2019-09-16,"Nucor Lowers Q3 Earnings Guidance, Sees 'Softening' In Some Markets","Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) lowered its earnings guidance for the third quarter ending Sept. 28 on Monday and said it expects earnings to be in the range of 75 cents to 80 cents per diluted share. The news sent shares of steel companies trading lower. Nucor's second-quarter earnings were $1.26 per diluted share, and the guidance also represents a year-over-year decrease from earnings of $2.13 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. The performance of the steel mills segment in the third quarter of 2019 is expected to decrease compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower prices for sheet and plate steel. “Although we still see stability in most of the end use markets that we serve, there has been some softening in automotive, agricultural products and power transmission markets,” the company said in a statement. Outlook By Segment Nucor said it expects the profitability of the steel products segment to improve sequentially in the third quarter, as nonresidential construction market conditions remain strong. In addition, recently enacted efficiency initiatives in rebar fabrication and metal buildings are enhancing performance from those businesses, the company said. Nucor said the performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the third quarter due to further margin compression in the company's direct reduced iron businesses. Price Action Nucor shares were trading down 1.06% at the time of publication.

2019-09-19,US Steel Joins Chorus of Steelmakers Warning Of Q3 Underperformance,"The steel industry's cup of woes overflows, as evidenced by a string of warnings from a few of the biggest players in the sector. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) became the latest to warn of worsening fundamentals when it made a third-quarter pre-announcement late Wednesday. U.S. Steel shares were sinking 13.455 to $10.78 at the time of publication Thursday. Way Off The Mark The steelmaker said in a release it expects third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million, which excluded a $53-million impact from a fire at its Clairton coke making facility and estimated restructuring charges. The Pittsburg-based company now expects an adjusted third-quarter loss of 35 cents per share, notably wider than the 7-cent per share loss estimated by analysts, on average. Brittle Fundamentals After the strength witnessed in the summer, the flat-rolled steel market has softened, U.S. Steel said. The combination of falling steel prices through the second quarter and a bigger-than-expected drop in scrap prices will negatively impact flat-rolled earnings in the second half of the year, according to the company. U.S. Steel now expects full-year flat-rolled shipments to third-party customers to be 10.7 million tons, as it expects to idle two of its U.S. blast furnaces to match supply with demand forecasts. U.S. Steel also warned of a continued deterioration of market conditions in Europe, with the incongruence between steel selling prices and raw material costs pressuring margins. In line with its labor productivity strategy announced earlier, the company has thus far eliminated 1,800 positions of the planned 2,500 cuts planned by the end of 2021. Pressured by high import levels and weakening market conditions, the company's Tubular segment is expected to remain under pressure for the remainder of the year, U.S. Steel said. Not Alone In The Quagmire U.S. Steel's predicament is not company-specific, as two other big giants sounded the alarm in their guidance as well. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) pre-announced a third-quarter shortfall earlier this week, citing weakness in its steel mills and raw materials business. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) said Wednesday it expects third-quarter earnings of 68-70 cents per share, below the 71-cents-per-share consensus estimate, as shipments and average steel pricing of its sheet steel operations declined in the quarter.

2019-10-10,US Steel's Stronger-Than-Expected Preliminary Q3 Results Send Sector Higher,"United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) shares were trading higher Thursday after the company reported preliminary third-quarter results that outperformed gloomy guidance issued last month. The company expects a preliminary net loss in the range of $84 to $94 million, or a loss of 49-55 cents per diluted share. U.S. Steel reported a preliminary adjusted net loss of approximately $35 to $45 million, or a loss of 20-26 cents per share. Third-quarter preliminary adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in a range of $134 to $144 million. Stronger shipments and better than expected manufacturing performance in our flat-rolled segment, as well as a contingency gain from recovered claims arising out of the bankruptcy of a supplier drove better than expected results, the company said in a statement. The company had said on Sept. 18 it expected third-quarter adjusted EBITDA of $115 million and an adjusted third-quarter loss of 35 cents per share. U.S. Steel is set to report final third-quarter results Oct. 31. Price Action U.S. Steel shares were trading up 3.37% to $10.43 at the time of publication Thursday. The stock has a 52-week high of $29.84 and a 52-week low of $9.93. Steel Dynamics, Inc.

2019-10-22,15 Stocks Projected To Have The Biggest 5-Year EPS Declines,"Each earnings season, traders obsess over two numbers above all else: EPS and revenue. But seasoned traders know share prices often respond to the direction of EPS and revenue growth rather than their magnitude and size. A company with a low price-to-earnings ratio may look cheap to value investors at first glance. But if its EPS is declining over time, it could be a major red flag that something is fundamentally wrong with a company’s business model. Companies can milk earnings from businesses in secular decline for years, but those earnings declines almost always catch up to investors eventually. Largest Projected EPS Declines Many stocks experience short-term EPS fluctuations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. However, these 15 S&P 500 stocks are projected to have the largest EPS declines over the next five years, according to Finviz: Newell Co (NASDAQ:NWL), -14% growth.

2020-02-14,Carriers And Shippers Call For Long-Term Infrastructure Funding,"U.S. lawmakers negotiating new surface transportation legislation will need to include a long-term infrastructure funding plan if they're going to satisfy the nation's truck, rail and ocean carriers, as well as the carriers' customers. That theme was prevalent throughout roughly 75 comments submitted to the U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) in response to the agency's request for information on a National Freight Strategic Plan. While DOT has acknowledged that investment in freight infrastructure must be considered in transportation initiatives, users of the infrastructure assert that not enough attention or money is coming from the federal government. Lagging investment in critical infrastructure and inadequacy of long-term funding solutions is one of the three most important challenges facing the U.S. freight transportation system, asserted the Consumer Brands Association (CBA) in comments filed in response to DOT's request. CBA represents the $2 trillion consumer packaged goods industry. Its members include some of the country's largest private truck fleet operators. Eliminating freight pinch-points would be an easy way to evaluate progress on the most strategically important national freight system goals, the group noted, and evaluating long-term success may require the development of new KPIs [Key Performance Indicators], as a way of capturing overall impact and contribution to the national freight system. There's no national vision or strategy that evaluates how individual investments impact the overall safety and reliability of the goods movement system, Elaine Nessle, executive director for the Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors (CAGTC), told FreightWaves. Even though states have plans that have focused state investments on intrastate commerce, we haven't taken that systemwide approach needed to make those investments across the entire supply chain. In comments filed with DOT, Nessle and CAGTC, whose members include the nation's largest container ports, called for minimum annual federal funding of $12 billion for a multimodal competitive grant program. The current multimodal grant program, Infrastructure for Rebuilding America, made available $900 million for 2020. The American Trucking Associations (ATA) agreed, noting only the federal government is in a position to look at investment decisions in the context of national impacts and determine which investments can produce the greatest economic benefits regardless of jurisdictional considerations. While ATA ranked a shortage of labor as the No. 1 challenge in the trucking industry, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), which represents small-business trucking companies, ranked underinvestment in highway infrastructure as the country's most important freight challenge. Owner-operators and independent drivers must foot the bill for repair costs caused by inadequate infrastructure, the group emphasized, citing an internal study finding that OOIDA members spend roughly $5,000 a year on repairs due to highway damage or poor road conditions. For owner-operators, these costs result in less income and less investment for maintenance, equipment, and other critical safety upgrades. Nucor Steel (NYSE:NUE), one of a handful of shippers providing comments, placed infrastructure at the top of its main challenge list. Significant additional spending on transportation infrastructure is critically needed including, but not limited to, highways, bridges, rural connectors, locks and dams, the company stated. Additionally, with the growth of trade associated with the new USMCA, the nodes where the infrastructure of the US, Canada, and Mexico come together will need to be addressed. Even railroads, which compete with trucking for certain types of freight and frequently point out that they rely on their own profits to pay for their networks, acknowledged that a long-term funding plan is needed. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), one of the four largest U.S.-based railroads, maintained that DOT should institute policies that ensure long‐term viable funding sources for public and private transportation infrastructure, including highways, and that ensure that the primary users are paying for that infrastructure in some manner.

2020-07-06,What A Biden Victory Could Mean For US Steel Industry,"U.S. steel stocks have had a tough run under President Donald Trump, but Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners says things might not get much better for steel stocks if presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden wins the White House in November. Biden now has a 20-point lead over Trump, according to the online prediction market PredictIt.org. While steel investors may assume a Democratic victory in November would result in the rollback of Trump’s Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, Tanners said tariffs have historically been a nonpartisan issue. Both sides of the political aisle voiced concerns about Trump’s steel tariffs. While the tariffs seemingly haven’t done much to improve steel prices and margins during the Trump presidency, Tanners said Monday that removal of the tariffs at this point would have a negative impact on prices during a critical period for the industry in which it is overbuilding capacity. Other Political Factors One potential partisan headwind for the steel industry could be the fate of Trump’s border wall with Mexico. Most of the pipe for the proposed border was expected to be delivered by the end of 2020. Tanners said Democrats would likely halt construction of the wall, but whether or not they would tear down and scrap what has already been built could have a major impact on near-term steel prices. Two additional major political catalysts could have a significant impact on the US steel industry, according to Tanners. First, Biden’s plan to raise corporate tax rates from 21% to 28% would hurt steel stocks is Democrats gain control in Washington. However, a clean sweep by Democrats could also improve the chances that an infrastructure spending bill will be passed, a potential positive tailwind for steel demand. How To Play It For now, Tanners said investors should be careful in the U.S. steel space. “Ultimately, a potential Democrat win would add to our already cautious thesis on most U.S. steel names,” Tanners wrote in a note. Bank of America has Underperform ratings on Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Bank of America has a $34 target for Nucor, a $23 target for Steel Dynamics and a $3 target for U.S. Steel. Benzinga’s Take At this point, the U.S. steel group is a highly speculative space given the tremendous political risk and uncertainty regarding the election and the potential outlook in 2020 and beyond. Add in the uncertainty created from the COVID-19 outbreak and the trade war with China, and there are simply too many unknowns for investors to have much confidence in steel stocks these days.

2020-10-21,Nucor's Earnings Outlook,"On Thursday, October 22, Nucor (NYSE: NUE) will release its latest earnings report. Check out Benzinga's preview to understand the implications. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings, also known as net income, is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Based on management's projections, Nucor analysts model for earnings of $0.51 per share on sales of $4.54 billion. In the same quarter last year, Nucor reported EPS of $0.9 on revenue of $5.46 billion. What Are Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises, And Why Do They Matter? Analysts who cover this company will publish forward-looking estimates of its revenue and EPS each quarter. Averaging together every EPS and revenue prediction that each analyst makes about a company in a quarter yields the consensus estimates. A company posting earnings or revenue above or below the consensus estimate is known as an earnings surprise and may move the stock by a considerable margin. The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 43.33% decrease in the company's earnings. Revenue would be down 16.93% from the year-ago period. In comparison to analyst estimates in the past, here is how the company's reported EPS stacks up: Quarter Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 Q3 2019 EPS Estimate 0.13 0.95 0.31 0.84 EPS Actual 0.36 0.99 0.52 0.90 Revenue Estimate 4.46 B 5.38 B 4.94 B 5.56 B Revenue Actual 4.33 B 5.62 B 5.13 B 5.46 B Stock Performance Shares of Nucor were trading at $48.51 as of October 20. Over the last 52-week period, shares are down 7.06%. Given that these returns are generally negative, long-term shareholders are probably a little upset going into this earnings release."

2020-12-09,Price Over Earnings Overview: Nucor,"Looking into the current session, Nucor Inc. (NYSE:NUE) shares are trading at $57.01, after a 0.82% spike. Moreover, over the past month, the stock spiked by 12.18%, but in the past year, decreased by 1.91%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 107.12%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Metals & Mining stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company’s current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 27.16 in the Metals & Mining industry, Nucor Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 40.1. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Nucor Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It’s also possible that the stock is overvalued. There are many limitations to P/E ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings."

The Importance of Insider Transactions Insider transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however an insider transaction can be an important factor in the investing decision. Insiders buying stock after a notable sell off can indicate an insider's long-term belief in the success of the company; insiders buying stock at new highs can be an indication the exec doesn't feel the stock is overvalued. Insiders who sell stock at new lows could be anticipating some capitulation moment. If the insider sells at new highs, it could point to the intention to take some profit and lock in a gain. Important Transaction Codes Wall Street tends to focus on insider transactions which take place in the open market, viewed inside a Form 4 filing via codes P for purchase and S for sale. An open-market transaction means the insider went into the market of their own volition and made an active decision about the potential path for a company and its stock moving forward. Transaction codes other than P or S are often viewed with less conviction as they are often not tied to a decision by the exec. As an example, transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option. Transaction code A indicates the insider may have been forced to sell shares in order to receive compensation the exec was promised upon being hired by a company."

2021-01-08,Here's How The US Steel Industry Is Getting Greener,"The U.S. steel industry is leading the world in turning its business green. In a note out on Friday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said U.S. steel producers like United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) already produce some of the world’s greenest steel, and their shift to electric arc furnace (EAF) production will reduce their carbon footprints even further. Steel Emissions Targets: EAFs are about 75% more emissions-efficient than traditional blast furnace steel mills, according to Tanners. Today, only 28% of global steel production comes from EAFs. The International Energy Agency has said the global steel industry should aim to boost that percentage to 40% by 2030. Related Link: Cleveland-Cliffs' ArcelorMittal Asset Purchase Could Help Combat 'Steelmageddon' However, the U.S. steel industry is already paving the path to a greener future, on track to produce more than 80% of its total output via EAFs by 2023. In addition to lessening its impact on the planet, Tanners says public steel companies have major financial incentives to go green. “Our equity strategists in early 2020 estimated $20T of asset inflows would be directed into impact investing over the next few decades, with $3T of assets already using climate change in their investment decisions,” she wrote the note. How To Play It: Steel stocks are going green, but Tanners said that doesn’t necessarily mean steel stock investors will be seeing green in the near future given the pricing pressures the industry is facing. Bank of America has the following ratings and price targets for U.S. steel stocks: U.S. Steel: Underperform rating, $8 target. Commercial Metals: Neutral rating, $22 target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral rating, $40 target. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Underperform rating, $45 target. Benzinga’s Take: The best hope for U.S. steel stock investors in the near-term would be an aggressive infrastructure spending plan from the Biden administration.

2021-01-28,A Look Into Nucor's Debt,"Over the past three months, shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) increased by 3.88%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Nucor has. Nucor's Debt According to the Nucor's most recent balance sheet as reported on November 12, 2020, total debt is at $5.53 billion, with $5.45 billion in long-term debt and $74.25 million in current debt. Adjusting for $2.87 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $2.66 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, investors look at the debt ratio. Considering Nucor's $19.52 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.28. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-02-23,Jim Cramer Says 'Not 'Too Late' To Bet On These Reopening Plays,"Jim Cramer said Monday it is not too late “to make a big bet” on reopening stocks. What Happened: “You’re no longer early with these names, but that doesn’t mean you’re late either,” the CNBC “Mad Money” host said. Cramer’s picks include Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS), Marriott International Inc (NASDAQ:MAR), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), Southwest Airlines Co (NYSE:LUV), and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL). The former hedge fund manager also foresees a rise in business for credit card companies such as Visa Inc (NYSE:V), Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP). Other favorites include Estee Lauder Companies Inc (NYSE:EL), Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT), Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), and Simon Property Group Inc (NYSE:SPG). “We all know the day will come, the day when we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. We knew the reopening stocks would jump ahead of time,” said Cramer. Why It Matters: The CNBC host advocated that investors latch on to the uptrend in economic recovery stocks but also advised that they should maintain exposure to growth stocks. “It is not too late to make a big bet on the reopening stocks, but remember to sock away a couple of the better growth names on the way down, too.” Cramer’s travel sector picks all ended the trading day in green on Monday. Royal Caribbean closed 9.33% higher in the regular session the same day to $86.23. The bounce in the shares came despite the cruise liner reporting a net loss of $5.8 billion in 2020 as against the income of $1.9 billion a year prior."

2021-03-09,Insider Sells Nucor's Shares,"Executive Vice President Query Kenneth Rex filed a Form 4 with the SEC on Tuesday, March 9. The insider sold 300 shares of Nucor Inc (NYSE:NUE)at an average price of $65.54. After the transaction, the executive's stake in Nucor Inc. moved to 63,510 shares. Nucor was trading 0.2% lower from the previous closing price. Why Insider Transactions Are Important? While transactions from an insider shouldn't be used as the sole item to make an investment or trading decision, an insider buying or selling stock in their company can be a good added factor that leads to more conviction in a decision. Insiders buying stock after a notable sell off can indicate an insider's long-term belief in the success of the company; insiders buying stock at new highs can be an indication the exec doesn't feel the stock is overvalued. Conversely, insiders who are selling stock at new lows can potentially indicate some kind of capitulation moment. Insiders selling at new highs can indicate that exec wants to take some profit and lock in a gain. Transaction Codes To Focus On Investors prefer focusing on transactions which take place in the open market, indicated in the Form 4 with codes P for purchase and S for sale. An open-market transaction means the insider went into the market of their own volition and made an active decision about the potential path for a company and its stock moving forward. Transaction codes besides P or S aren't relatively important as they are seldom tied to a decision by the executive. For example, transaction code A is indicative of an insider being forced to sell shares to attain compensation. Moreover, transaction code C indicates the conversion of an option."

2021-03-29,Understanding Nucor's Ex-Dividend Date,"On February 23, 2021, Nucor (NYSE:NUE) announced shareholders can expect to receive a dividend payable on May 11, 2021. The stock will then go ex-dividend 1 business day(s) before the record date. Nucor has an ex-dividend date set for for March 30, 2021. The company's current dividend payout is $0.41, which equates to a dividend yield of 2.71% at current price levels. What Are Ex-Dividend Dates? An ex-dividend date is when a company's shares stop trading with its current dividend payout in preparation for the company to announce a new one. Usually, a company's ex-dividend date falls one business day before its record date. Investors should keep this in mind when purchasing stocks because buying them on or after ex-dividend dates does not qualify them to receive the declared payment. Newly declared dividends go to shareholders who have owned that stock before the ex-dividend date. Typically, companies will announce and implement new dividend yields on a quarterly basis. Understanding Nucor's Dividend Payouts And Yields Over the past year, Nucor has seen its dividend payouts remain the same and its yields trend downward. Last year on March 30, 2020 the company's payout sat at $0.4, which has returned to its value today. Nucor's dividend yield last year was 3.41%, which has since decreased by 0.7%. Companies use dividend yields in different strategic ways. Some companies may opt to not give yields altogether to reinvest in themselves. Other companies may opt to increase or decrease their yield amounts to control how their shares circulate throughout the stock market. To read more about Nucor click here."
2021-03-30,4 Infrastructure Stocks To Watch Ahead Of Biden's Trillion-Dollar Proposal,"Later this week, President Joe Biden is expected to unveil the details of a $3-trillion infrastructure package. While a great deal of early attention has been focused on new investments in cleantech solutions designed to address climate change, the package will also address the rebuilding of the nation's fraying transportation infrastructure including highways, bridges and rail lines. For investors who are considering the companies that will be active participants in the upgrades to physical infrastructure, here are four stocks that deserve an in-depth look. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT): It's safe to assume that the world's largest construction equipment manufacturer will have some type of involvement in any infrastructure endeavor. The company is in the right place at the right time. The U.S. manufacturing world is more than eager to move beyond the pandemic era, as witnessed in the Institute for Supply Management data from March 1 that found manufacturing activity in February on the rise, marking the ninth straight consecutive month of sector gains. Still, the economic residue from the pandemic needs to be considered. Caterpillar posted fourth-quarter revenue of $11.2 billion, a 15% decrease compared with $13.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The quarter's profit per share of $1.42 was down from $1.97 one year earlier. Chairman and CEO Donald James Umpleby is optimistic on this year, declaring that the company has been making investments over the last few years in our digital capabilities, in many of our processes and our models, and we're going to work hard to leverage those connected assets and those investments that we've made to grow services going forward, and we think that represents just an excellent opportunity for future profitable growth over the next few years. Caterpillar closed Monday at $230.22, slightly under its 52-week high of $237.78 and distant from its 52-week low of $100.22. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. (NYSE:CP): Many infrastructure projects will rely on rail transportation for material shipments, and Canadian Pacific is in a great way to move materials. On March 21, the company announced it was buying Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) in a $25-billion transaction that creates a combined rail network connecting points throughout Canada and Mexico and points in the Midwest, Northeast and South Central U.S. This is Canadian Pacific's second acquisition within a year. Last June, it completed its today completed acquisition of the Central Maine & Quebec Railway U.S. Inc. We delivered fourth quarter revenues of C$2 billion, which was an all-time quarterly record, operating ratio of 53.9%, and adjusted EPS growth of 6%. An industry leading performance for the year, total revenues were down only 1%. We produced an all-time record operating ratio of 57.1%, operating income was up 6% to C$3.3 billion, which enabled a record adjusted EPS of C$17.67, an increase of 7% versus last year, truly an outstanding achievement across the board, President and CEO Keith Creek said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in January. Canadian Pacific closed Monday at $364.25, closer to its 52-week high of $385.87 and distant from its 52-week low of $205.26. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) – This Charlotte, North Carolina-headquartered company holds the distinction of being the nation's largest steel producer, the largest mini-mill steelmaker and the largest scrap recycler. Any major infrastructure projects planned for the near-future will certainly have Nucor's involvement. To date, 2021 has been a very good year for Nucor. The stock has gained approximately 37% since New Year's Day, and on March 16 the company announced guidance for its first quarter ending April 3, with expected earnings in the range of $3 to $3.10 per diluted share, which would be the highest quarterly earnings in Nucor history. March is expected to be the strongest month of the quarter, the company said in a statement. Margins have expanded since the beginning of the year, a trend we expect to continue into the second quarter. We believe earnings in the second quarter of 2021 will likely set a new record for quarterly earnings. Nucor closed Monday at $78.75, closer to its 52-week high $82.76 and far from its 52-week low of $32.16. U.S. Concrete Inc. (NASDAQ:USCR): What's an infrastructure project without concrete, and what is the concrete sector without this Texas-based firm? Last year, the company sold approximately 8.2 million cubic yards of ready-mixed concrete and approximately 12.6 million tons of aggregates. While the pandemic's tumult still resonated with U.S. Concrete — its fourth quarter revenue of $334 million was down 9.43% year-over-year, which missed the estimate of $352,880,000 — it nonetheless continued to show resilience. Its earnings per share increased 17.02% year-over-year to 55 cents, which beat the estimate of 26 cents. CEO Ronnie Pruitt predicted a strong second half in 2021 led by robust residential activity across all of our markets, complemented by heavy industrial commercial projects, including warehouses, data centers, and other commercial work that supports the development of new neighborhoods. Our key markets all expect strong and resilient activity for infrastructure, including freeways, roads and streets, either with or without the federal infrastructure bill. U.S. Concrete closed Monday at $66.36, closer to its 52-week high of $71.19 and far from its 52-week low of $13.66. Photo by Daniele Longo/Pixabay."
2021-03-31,"3 Steel Stocks Heating Up This Week: US Steel, Steel Dynamics, Nucor Technical Levels","Steel stocks have been heating up this week, with bullish moves in a few tickers. United States Steel Corp. (NYSE:X), Steel Dynamics Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Nucor Corp. (NASDAQ:NUE) are three steel movers. These stocks may be potential long-term investments. Below is a daily chart analysis for each of the three stocks. US Steel Daily Chart Analysis: The daily chart above shows there are three potentially key levels on the U.S Steel chart. The stock may have broken out of a channel. The stock was previously trading in a channel between the price levels of $20 and $25 before the stock broke above the $25 level. This $25 level needs to hold for the stock to see higher moves. Below the $25 level, the stock may not find support until the $20 level, and below $20 not until $16. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support. Steel Dynamics Daily Chart Analysis: The chart shows the stock has been in an uptrend throughout the last year, which can be shown by connecting the lows with a line. The stock recently broke above $44, an area it struggled to get over in the past. The stock then found support at this level. This is an area the stock may stay above in the future. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support. Nucor Daily Chart Analysis: Nucor stock has taken off over the last week, making new highs. The chart recently broke above resistance of $67.50 and was able to retest it as support. This is an area where the stock may find support again in the future. If the stock were to fall below $67.50, it might not find support again until $57.50. The stock is trading higher than the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating bullish sentiment and another potential area of support."
2021-04-07,Record Steel Prices Create Investment Opportunities For These 4 Stocks,"U.S. hot-rolled coil steel prices recently hit all-time highs of $1,300 per short ton. Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said Wednesday that record prices will generate huge profits for steel mills in the first half of 2021. Heading into first-quarter earnings season, Tanners said investors will be watching closely for indications from management about how steel companies will be spending their excess cash. Excess Cash: Tanners said some companies will obviously use the near-term cash windfall to pay down debt and improve unhealthy balance sheets. However, she said companies with healthy balance sheets, such as Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS) and Ternium SA (NYSE:TX), have several options for how to allocate that extra cash. Related Link: Gordon Johnson On 'Perfect Storm For The Steel Mills': Why He's Bullish On US Steel, Cleveland-Cliffs One likely scenario is they will use a significant portion of it to fund working capital growth for downstream operations, Tanner said. She added that management may be hesitant to spend the cash on buybacks given the steel market appears to be at or near a cyclical peak. That same line of reasoning could discourage M&A deals in the near future given the current steel environment is a seller’s market. “While we think M&A could heat up, aided by low interest rates and plentiful cash, we see limited options for mills and likely more downstream processing and bolt-on growth, such as NUE’s recent pipe mill or a new galvanizing or paint line, typically ~$250-300M,” Tanners said. How To Play It: Tanners is projecting steel prices will trend “sharply lower” in the second half of 2021. Bank of America has the following ratings and price targets for the steel stocks mentioned: Nucor: Underperform rating, $56 price target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral rating, price $49 target. Reliance Steel: Buy rating, $167 price target. Ternium: Buy rating, $44 price target. Benzinga’s Take: All four steel stocks mentioned are up at least 45% in the past six months, so the excess cash flow Tanners is expecting in the first half of 2021 may already be priced into the stocks to a large degree. The big question for steel stock investors is when steel prices start to pull back and how deep that pullback will be. (Photo: Ternium)"

2021-04-20,"BofA Upgrades Steel Dynamics, Nucor Amid Record Steel Prices","U.S. steel prices remain at record highs. One analyst says investors shouldn’t fight the trend and upgraded two steel stocks. The Analyst: Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners upgraded Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD) from Neutral to Buy and raised her price target from $49 to $61. Tanners also upgraded Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) from Underperform to Neutral and raised her price target from $56 to $80. In addition to the upgrades, Tanners reiterated ratings on the following steel stocks: Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS): Buy rating, price target raised from $167 to $182. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC): Underperform rating, price target raised from $24 to $25. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Underperform rating, price target raised from $12 to $14. Related Link: Record Steel Prices Create Investment Opportunities For These 4 Stocks The Thesis: Tanners said the U.S. steel market has bucked multi-decade downward pricing trends and set new record in 2021. Tanners said steel prices will normalize once the industry works through the current patch of temporary undersupply produced by COVID-19 related production disruptions. However, she said the near-term earnings windfall for steel companies as a result of the spike in steel prices could have a positive impact on the balance sheets of the top steel stocks through at least the first three quarters of 2021. “STLD and NUE not only have better balance sheets as a result of this unprecedented steel environment, but in our view are well positioned to continue to dominate and operate capacity even assuming oversupply down the road,” Tanners wrote in the note. She said U.S. Steel will likely get the least benefit from the near-term windfall profits given it needs more than $2 billion in major repairs to existing assets. Benzinga’s Take: Record steel prices may not last, but both Nucor and Steel Dynamics appear to already be pricing in a pullback in steel prices at some point. Nucor shares trade at just 18.8 times forward earnings, while Steel Dynamics has a forward earnings multiple of just 14.9."

2021-04-23,What Does Nucor's Debt Look Like?,"Shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) increased by 45.00% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Nucor has. Nucor's Debt Based on Nucor's balance sheet as of February 26, 2021, long-term debt is at $5.27 billion and current debt is at $68.79 million, amounting to $5.34 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $2.64 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $2.70 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Nucor has $20.13 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.27. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Equity owners can keep excess profit, generated from the debt capital, when companies use the debt capital for its business operations. Looking for stocks with low debt-to-equity ratios?

2021-04-28,'Unprecedented Steel Bubble': Here's How To Play It,"Record U.S. steel prices have steel stocks soaring, but Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said Wednesday the steel stock party won’t last forever. Tanners recently did a deep dive on past steel price peaks and found a history of sharp drops in steel prices and stocks. History Lesson: So far, Tanners has seen no evidence that U.S. steel prices have reached the current cycle’s peak given new capacity has been delayed until late 2021. Hot-rolled coil (HRC) steel prices recently ranged between $1,400 and $1,500 per ton, more than double their 10-year average of $641. Prior steel price peaks in 2004, 2008, 2016 and 2018 suggest steel stocks will peak roughly a month before steel prices do, suggesting investors should be watching stock prices more closely than steel prices. Related Link: BofA Upgrades Steel Dynamics, Nucor Amid Record Steel Prices How To Play It: Tanners said past steel market corrections have hit higher-levered stocks hardest, which doesn’t bode well for United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X). Instead, she prefers Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD), both of which should be able to offset the negative impact of falling steel prices by ramping up capacity. No matter what, Tanners said investors need to understand the risks in the steel space these days. “A cautious and nimble approach is best navigating cyclicals late in the price cycle amid an unprecedented steel bubble, in our opinion,” she wrote in a note. Benzinga’s Take: Record steel prices may not last, but both Nucor and Steel Dynamics appear to already be pricing in a pullback in steel prices at some point. Nucor shares trade at just 17.6 times forward earnings, while Steel Dynamics has a forward earnings multiple of just 13.7."

2021-05-18,MAGA ETF Is Outperforming S&P 500 Months After Trump Left Office,"An ETF named after a popular Donald Trump phrase is outperforming the market after the president was voted out of office. What Happened: One question asked by those following the ETF market around the time of the 2020 Presidential Election was what would happen to an ETF that tied itself to Donald Trump. The Point Bridge GOP Stock Tracker ETF (BATS:MAGA) tracks companies in the S&P 500 that make donations to the Republican party. The ETF had assets of $8.6 million when Benzinga last wrote about it prior to the election. The ETF was launched in September 2017. Hal Lambert, the man behind the MAGA ETF, said the ETF would continue if Trump lost and the ETF would keep the MAGA symbol. “The goal for this ETF was the have something for conservatives to invest in that hasn’t been out there,” Lambert said at the time. The S&P 500 was up 16.3% in 2020 and averaged annual returns of 14.5% during Trump's time in office. Related Link: What Happens To The MAGA ETF If Trump Loses The Presidential Election? The MAGA ETF Today: The Point Bridge GOP Stock Tracker ETF holds 152 different stocks in the ETF. None of the individual stocks make up more than 0.9% of assets. The ETF has risen in assets under management with $11.2 million at the time of writing. Here is a look at the top 10 holdings in the MAGA ETF: Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) United Parcel Services (NYSE:UPS) Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE:TAP) Textron Inc (NYSE:TXT) PPG Industries Inc (NYSE:PPG) Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW) Allstate Corporation (NYSE:ALL) D.R. Horton Inc (NYSE:DHI) Year to date, the MAGA ETF is up 25.5% compared to an 11.5% increase for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY). Over the last 52 weeks, the MAGA ETF is up 79% compared to the 48% increase in the SPY. Part of the outperformance could have to do with sector weightings. One flaw before for the MAGA ETF was it didn’t have as many technology companies in the ETF as many of them didn’t donate to the Republican party. The MAGA ETF is heavier on defense and materials names and light on technology. The shift in investors looking for value stocks instead of high growth technology has helped MAGA outperform. Could a Republican-themed ETF continue to make ETFs great again? Time will tell. Photo Credit: Public image via Wikimedia."

He initiated the trade when the stock was trading at $79, so it has done very well since the purchase, even after the recent decline in Nucor.

2021-06-16,Where Nucor Stands With Analysts,"Nucor (NYSE:NUE) has observed the following analyst ratings within the last quarter: Last 30 Days 1 Month Ago 2 Months Ago 3 Months Ago Bullish 0 0 0 2 Somewhat Bullish 0 0 0 0 Indifferent 1 1 2 0 Somewhat Bearish 0 0 0 0 Bearish 0 0 0 0 In the last 3 months, 7 analysts have offered 12-month price targets for Nucor. The company has an average price target of $90.29 with a high of $114.00 and a low of $71.00. This current average represents a 28.07% increase from the previous average price target of $70.5. How Are Analyst Ratings Determined? Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Analysts may suggest actions like buy, sell, hold, or similar verbage for each stock based on research compiled from the corresponding company. Analysts who suggest buy are telling traders to purchase the stock based on forecasted growth. On the flip side, analysts who suggest sell are telling traders to dump the stock because of a similarly forecasted decline. Analysts who suggest hold are telling investors that they see short-term or mid-term stagnation and to maintain their positions on the stock. Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders."
2021-06-16,The 'Great Steel Squeeze Of 2021' Continues: What's Next?,"The 2021 surge in steel prices has once again prompted Bank of America to raise its earnings outlook for U.S. steel stocks. EPS Adjustments: On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners raised her 2021 and 2022 EPS estimates for steel stocks across the board and is now expecting significant earnings beats from all the steel stocks she covers in 2021. Here’s a rundown of the 2021 EPS changes: Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC), EPS estimate raised from 78 cents to 87 cents. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), EPS estimate raised from $4.40 to $5.38. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co (NYSE:RS), EPS estimate cut from $4.43 to $4.35. Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NYSE:STLD), EPS estimate raised from $2.96 to $3.62. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), EPS estimate raised from $2.53 to $2.80. Related Link: 'Unprecedented Steel Bubble': Here's How To Play It Despite the near-term tailwinds in steel prices, Tanners said the current pricing environment is unsustainable and investors should be prepared for the fallout. U.S. benchmark hot rolled coil spot prices recently reached near $1,700 per ton, about 2.5 times higher than their historical level. How To Play It: Tanners is projecting HRC steel prices will fall to an average of $1,075 in the second half of 2021 and all the way back down to $600 in 2022. “Our conviction of falling prices is supported by our Steelmageddon oversupply thesis, which was delayed to 2022E due to 2021’s COVID-inspired supply squeeze and some delayed capacity startups,” Tanners said. The analyst said steel stocks typically correct before steel prices do in past bubbles, making timing the trade very difficult. For now, she said investors need to be selective within the steel group. Her top stock picks include Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF), Reliance and Steel Dynamics. Benzinga’s Take: The VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX) is already up 38.3% year-to-date, so the excess cash flow Tanners is expecting in coming quarters may already be priced into the stocks to a large degree. The big question for steel stock investors is when steel prices start to pull back and how deep that pullback will be."

2021-07-12,Analyzing Nucor's Unusual Options Activity,"Nucor (NYSE:NUE) shares experienced unusual options activity on Monday. The stock price moved up to $97.88 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-07-16 Strike Price: $98.00 Volume: 468 Open Interest: 163 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-07-15,Unusual Options Activity Insight: Nucor,"Nucor (NYSE:NUE) shares experienced unusual options activity on Thursday. The stock price moved up to $95.9 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-10-15 Strike Price: $100.00 Volume: 250 Open Interest: 4993 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity.

What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Wall Street expects EPS of $4.74 and sales around $8.31 billion. In the same quarter last year, Nucor reported earnings per share of $0.36 on sales of $4.33 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the consensus estimates; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an earnings surprise, which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Thursday, earnings would be up 1216.67%. Revenue would be up 92.05% from the year-ago period. In comparison to analyst estimates in the past, here is how the company's reported EPS stacks up: Quarter Q1 2021 Q4 2020 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 EPS Estimate 3.09 1.18 0.51 0.13 EPS Actual 3.10 1.30 0.67 0.36 Revenue Estimate 7.19 B 5.34 B 4.54 B 4.46 B Revenue Actual 7.02 B 5.26 B 4.93 B 4.33 B Want Real-Time Earnings Calendar Updates?

2021-07-29,Understanding Nucor's Unusual Options Activity,"Shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) saw some unusual options activity on Thursday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $103.7. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-10-15 Strike Price: $90.00 Volume: 345 Open Interest: 629 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-08-06,"Cramer Says Forget AMC, Robinhood In This Frothy Market And Buy These Old-School Undervalued Stocks","CNBC host Jim Cramer is advising investors to forget the craziness around Reddit-favorite stocks such as AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC), GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and Robinhood Markets Inc. (NASDAQ:HOOD), and instead focus on “cheap stocks” in a market trading at record highs. What Happened: “Focus on the cheap stocks that have done nothing and sell for peanuts. They’re a lot more plentiful than you might think,” the “Mad Money” host said. Cramer believes Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is undervalued, noting that the Dow component was actually down for the year until Wells Fargo upgraded the stock on Thursday. Cramer is also bullish on Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) and steelmaking stocks such as Nucor Corp. (NYSE:NUE). Nucor is the best-run steelmaker in the world, according to the CNBC host. Further, Cramer pointed to home builders such as Toll Brothers Inc. (NYSE:TOL), Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN), D R Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI) and KB Home (NYSE:KBH) as good bargains as these stocks do not reflect the relentless demand for new homes. See Also: If You Invested $1,000 In Walmart Stock One Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Why It Matters: Shares of Reddit-favorite stocks such as Robinhood, AMC Entertainment and GameStop are seeing high volatility in recent days. Robinhood's shares fell more than 27% on Thursday after surging 50% in the previous session. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is seeing success with its e-commerce business in recent years. The company reported 37% online sales growth in the first quarter of this year. Ford reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter last week and said it plans to spend more on electric vehicles than traditional internal combustion vehicles starting in 2023. Price Action: Walmart shares closed almost 1.9% higher in Thursday’s trading at $145.49, while Ford shares closed 2.9% higher at $13.71.

2021-08-10,"Why Alcoa, Nucor Shares Are Trading Higher Today","Shares of metals and building materials companies including Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) and Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) are trading higher Tuesday after the U.S. Senate voted to pass a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which has lifted demand outlook for materials.

The company also produces direct reduced iron for use in its steel mills. Price Action: At last check Tuesday, Alcoa was up 8.33% at $43.91 and Nucor was up 9.24% at $117.74."
2021-08-11,Inflation Slowing On The Consumer End As Market Awaits Tomorrow's Report On Producer Costs,"These days, monthly inflation reports carry almost as much weight in the market as monthly job reports. Today’s consumer price index for July came in around expectations, meaning the impact on Wall Street might not be too heavy. Consumer prices rose 0.5%, right on target with the average analyst consensus and down from 0.9% a month early. Year-over-year, the headline consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4%. A couple of years ago, that would have sounded like a pretty far-out number, but today it might ease some fears by suggesting inflation hasn’t moved much higher than where it was a month ago. The core inflation number that strips out food and energy rose 4.3%, and may be worth a closer look because it’s a little less likely to get blown around by the ups and downs of the gasoline market. The key question out there now, which we’ll address lower down, is whether today’s inflation print might give the Fed more ammunition in any attempt to start tapering its stimulus program. That remains to be seen, but there’s nothing in the CPI that looks too dramatic. Producer Prices Up Next CPI was the highlight this morning, and that’s followed quickly by July producer prices tomorrow. That report is expected to show 0.5% overall growth from June, which would be slower than 1% growth the previous month. In normal times, the 0.5% Wall Street consensus would appear pretty high, but in the current era where prices have been pushing higher almost all year, 0.5% sounds relatively tame. Last time out, final services demand accounted for most of the gains, so we’ll see if there was follow-through In July. Remember, producer prices often can be even more of a barometer than consumer prices. Companies that face higher prices in the wholesale market can either pass those along to customers—which can hurt demand—or absorb the higher costs, which can hurt company margins. The Fed has said current inflation is “transitory” but also acknowledged it’s been a stronger wave than the central bank had expected. While most of the focus today is probably going to be on inflation, crude is also worth keeping an eye on. It’s been all over the place this week and this morning it’s back below $67 a barrel after topping $68 yesterday. The headlines today say one contributing factor to the drop is the White House telling OPEC to boost production. Whatever the reason for today’s losses, for the moment crude seems to be our Delta variant barometer. When fears of Delta rise, crude goes down, and vice versa. Speaking of barometers, airlines have been a virus barometer for a long time. Today, they might come under pressure amid news that Southwest (NYSE:LUV) has had a lot of cancellations. The company also said it’s seen a slowdown in near-term bookings and that operating revenue for August will be lower than it previously thought. It sounds like Delta (the virus, not the airline competitor) could be taking a bite out of travel plans. Fed Becoming Life Of The Party? There’s a bit of a buzz on Wall Street we haven’t seen in a while. It’s not just that major indices keep posting new highs or excitement over bitcoin’s recent gains. It also reflects growing sentiment that the Fed could be on the verge of announcing a policy change. Now having said that, it’s nothing they’re going to surprise investors with. At least not if Fed Chairman Jerome Powell keeps his promise to provide a long runway in announcing any changes in the central bank’s approach. Instead, it’s more like a long glide into the airport, where landing means the Fed announces a start date to taper some of its stimulus. The talk began last week when Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan called for a gradual, balanced bond purchase tapering sooner rather than later. Since then, the dollar index has steadily risen, gold has been on the run, and the benchmark 10-year yield clawed back above 1.3% after falling as low as 1.12% just a week ago. No single Fed governor can set policy, obviously, but Kaplan isn’t the only reason there’s a buzz. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) came out with a report early this week suggesting the Fed might announce tapering by the end of this year, begin tapering Jan. 1, and then raise rates in Q2 2023. That’s a bit earlier than many analysts had expected, and it remains to be seen if MS has it right. There may be clues later this month when Powell delivers his Jackson Hole speech or in the Fed minutes from its late July meeting that are scheduled for release a week from today. MS says its estimates are based on progress in the labor market following two straight months of huge job gains. The Fed is focused more on the labor situation than inflation, MS said, and there’s optimism that jobs could continue getting filled as the school year begins (see more below) and Covid-related unemployment benefits expire. By the end of the year, MS said, the job losses from Covid could be closing the gap and be about halfway back to pre-Covid levels. The Fed has said it wants to see actual progress toward its unemployment goals ahead of any policy move. It’s a “show me the money” type of approach where instead of trying to anticipate, the Fed actually wants a bird in hand before pulling any levers. There’s more thought on the Street that despite Delta, that bird may be coming in for a landing sometime this fall. This all makes the next six weeks—highlighted by Fed minutes next week, the Jackson Hole speech late this month, and the next Fed meeting in just over a month—stand out in terms of policy focus. We should know a lot more by late September than we do now. CHART OF THE DAY: GREEN MACHINE. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY—candlestick) is on a roll, though to be fair some of its strength is more a reflection of current weakness in the Euro and worries about the European economy instead of bullishness over the dollar itself. The $DXY has now spent more consecutive days above its 200-day moving average (blue line) than at any point since the pandemic hit in the spring of last year. Some of the dollar strength might reflect impressions that the Fed could get more hawkish. Data source: ICE. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Blue Chip Bump Thanks To Rates, Congress: Rapidly rising Treasury yields appeared to help breathe some life into blue-chip cyclical like the big banks and Energy firms this week. Those improved yields could indicate improvement in the U.S. economy, which tends to help stocks in sectors that often depend on a tailwind from the macro environment. Meanwhile, steel and mining firms got a nice jolt Tuesday from the Senate passing the infrastructure bill, though as we said yesterday, that one still has a long path to becoming the law of the land. For now, it’s not fair to steal the thunder from stocks like U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) and Nucor (NYSE:NUE), which lifted off in a big way on the news. So who’s on the other side of the ledger as cyclical and steel pick up steam? Technology. Most of the big tech firms were in the red Tuesday, making the tech-heavy Nasdaq (COMP: GIDS) the weakest performer of the big-three indices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI), which is packed with banks and energy firms, had the best day of the three. Crude Future: You often hear about how crude prices can help or hurt stocks. The focus is usually on front-month crude futures, which bounced back nicely from Monday’s lows. What we don’t often hear about but could be worth monitoring is what the market projects crude prices to be moving forward. At this point, the market is in “backwardation,” which means prices of contracts expiring in coming months and years trade below the front month. A “backwardation” market is one where traders expect prices to fall over time. You don’t have to dig too deep into the CME crude futures complex to see that. By the end of the year, the market trades about 75 cents below today’s price. The price falls below $65 by next February and below $64 by next April. Trading gets much thinner the farther out you go, but it’s interesting to note that the December 2024 contract has had some action lately at a price below $55. You have to go back to early February 2021 to find a price that low. While that contract has many years of trading ahead and certainly could move higher, its current discount could indicate that investors expect crude production to eventually begin catching up with demand. Or it could mean people are worried the economic recovery won’t last. Retail Investing Trends To Watch? This week’s Investor Movement Index® (IMXSM) showed a couple of interesting trends in the retail investor world. First, it looks like people are learning about using rising prices as possible selling points for at least some of their shares. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit a 52-week high in July, and investors tracked by IMX reduced their positions in the stock. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) also saw some selling as prices rose from a near-term trough. Another interesting thing was investors’ apparent willingness to buy stocks like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Didi Global (NYSE:DIDI) despite concerns over the regulatory environment in China. One month is never a trend, but if this continues it may suggest investors aren’t as fearful about putting money into Chinese stocks as some may have thought. Speaking of China, U.S. car companies have big markets there, and Ford (NYSE:F) was another stock that attracted retail investors tracked by IMX. Both F and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are getting more involved in the electric vehicle market, a reminder that TSLA isn’t the only game in town here. As you may know, F and GM have pretty decent experience with vehicle distribution.

In fact, over that time, the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB) has a negative total return of 2.8% compared to a positive total return of 7.2% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). Assuming the economic reopening will once again get back on track at some point, there could be some attractive value opportunities within the materials sector to buy on the dip. Here are the six S&P 500 materials sector stocks with the lowest forward earnings multiples, according to Finviz. LyondellBasell Industries NV (NYSE:LYB) LyondellBasell is a major U.S. producer of petrochemicals, including Olefins & Polyolefins. LyondellBasell’s costs are linked to natural gas prices, and its selling prices are correlated to oil prices. The stock’s total return in 2021 is just 9.2%, lagging both the S&P 500 and the materials sector as a whole. Its forward earnings multiple is just 6.5, lowest in the entire S&P 500 materials sector. Analysts have high hopes for a rebound in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 22 analysts covering LyondellBasell is $118, suggesting 18.1% upside from current levels. See Also: Expert Panel Talks China, Inflation And The Importance Of A Stock Selection Process Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) Mosaic produces and distributes crop nutrients, including phosphates and potash. Mosaic has actually bucked the trend in the materials sector this year and has generated a total return of 34% year-to-date. Even after its strong performance, the stock still has one of the lowest forward earnings multiples in the sector at just 7.8. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting even more upside for Mosaic in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 19 analysts covering the stock is $39, suggesting 23.8% upside from current levels. Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) Freeport-McMoRan is the world’s largest public copper producer. Like Mosaic, a strong copper market has helped Freeport generate an impressive 26.5% total return year-to-date. However, the stock’s 9.1 forward earnings multiple suggests there is still plenty of potential valuation upside for investors. Analysts covering the stock certainly seem optimistic the rally can continue. The average price target among the 15 analysts covering Freeport is $44, suggesting 28.8% upside from current levels. Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) Dow is a global chemical company that has lagged its materials peers and the S&P 500 so far in 2021, generating a 12% total return year-to-date. Value investors may like the stock’s forward earnings multiple of 10 and its attractive 4.5% dividend. The 20 analysts covering the stock have an average price target of $68.5, suggesting 10% upside for Down over the next 12 months. CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) CF Industries is another materials sector stock with significant exposure to the agricultural industries. The company is the largest North American producer of nitrogen fertilizers. CF shares have generated a total return of around 17% this year-roughly in line with the materials sector as a whole. The stock’s forward earnings multiple of just 10.1 might make the stock an attractive buy for value investors. The 17 analysts covering CF have an average price target of $60, suggesting 33.4% upside over the next 12 months. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) Supply shortages have sent steel prices soaring in 2021, and steel producer Nucor has been along for the ride. Nucor shares have generated a total return of 120.9% year-to-date leaving all the other materials stocks mentioned in the dust. Still, analysts are expecting big earnings numbers to continue for Nucor in coming quarters, and its forward earnings multiple remains just 10.6. The nine analysts covering Nucor are expecting some consolidation following the big move. Their average price target is just $110, suggesting 9% downside from current levels."

2021-09-20,Ripple Effect Pressuring Global Stock Markets,"The orderly selloff we’ve been having just got a bit disorderly. The markets started the week feeling like it was a Manic Monday with stock futures sharply lower on extended concerns regarding China’s real estate sector. Of particular interest is Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer Evergrande Group and whether Beijing will let the debt-laden firm fail. A default could mean potentially billions in losses for shareholders and bondholders around the world. This is on top of continued concerns that there could be ripple effects for the rest of the global economy as the Chinese government continues to tap down on its real estate and other industries that are considered in need of reining in. Meanwhile, lawmakers in Washington continued debating an increase to the government’s borrowing limits. The House is set to vote this week on the debt ceiling and a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating past the end of the fiscal year, which ends on September 30. The upshot was a clear risk-off tone to the market. Following sell-offs on Friday and this morning, the question now is will this become a prolonged number of sell-off days or will this signal a buying opportunity. Stuck In The September Doldrums Monday morning’s sell-off is a continuation to last week’s action, which ended on a down note as the major indices hit a roadblock following a rebound on Thursday. Selling was pretty widespread across the S&P 500 Index (SPX), with only Health Care and Consumer Staples even coming close to the unchanged mark. Those two sectors tend to be more defensive in nature. Overall, September continues to live up to its bad reputation as historically the weakest month of the year. But that doesn’t mean it can’t rebound. One thing we continued to see even during Friday’s worst moments was some “buying the dip” down near the 50-day moving average for the SPX. That level was near 4436 going into the end of last week and the SPX closed just below it at 4432.76. This morning the E-mini S&P 500 Index futures (/ES) are trading lower which could mean the SPX could start the week below the 50-day MA. The SPX has generally bounced every time it’s fallen to the 50-day MA so far this year. Hopefully, this means after two days of selloffs, there’s a chance we’ll rebuild from there. If the 50-day MA gets taken out in a major way (meaning several closes in a row below it), then it might be harder to find enthusiastic buyers and perhaps there could be a test of the 100-day MA down near 4326. That kind of move, interestingly enough, would get the SPX into basically a 5% downturn from its all-time high of 4545 set in early September. Many analysts have noted how long it’s been since the market had a 5% move lower. There hasn’t been one this year, which is kind of weird considering it’s something experienced nearly every year at some point. For the market to avoid that, it would probably help if it got some support from the mega-caps, but that didn’t happen late last week. The recent stretch has been a very tough one for the “trillion-dollar-plus” club, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) taking a hit almost every day lately despite last week’s Apple Event where the company introduced new products. Shares are down about 7% from the all-time high. When the mega-caps are suffering, the SPX tends to get hurt, too, because the Apples and Microsofts (NASDAQ:MSFT) of the world have a massive weighting in the index. AAPL has been under pressure ever since a judge’s recent ruling appeared to threaten the company’s revenue from apps. Fed Ahead It seems like we just got through the Fed’s Jackson Hole symposium and now there’s another Fed meeting straight ahead. The Fed gathers tomorrow, and it was interesting to see the benchmark 10-year yield climb toward recent highs Friday, although it has pulled back a bit today. The 10-year yield peaked Friday at a two-month high up near 1.39%. You have to go back to late June to find a time when the yield is regularly traded higher. Could this be a sign of some traders building in a little caution just in case Fed Chair Jerome Powell and company say anything hawkish this Wednesday in their statement and news conference? That might be the easy answer, though it’s hard to say for sure. Before the meeting approached, a lot of analysts were rolling back their expectations for a taper timing, with some now saying the November Fed meeting is a more likely time for that announcement. The Fed has made clear that it plans to “taper” its $120 billion a month in bond buying soon, but the market lacks clarity on when. It may be hard to see much direction until that riddle is solved. The Fed might have gotten a bit more breathing room thanks in part to last week’s relatively tame reading from the government on August consumer prices. Friday’s soft read on sentiment from the University of Michigan (up just barely from the August low) also provided evidence that people might be in a cautious mode. If consumers feel cautious, that could suggest anything from a weakening jobs market (August jobs growth was much lower than expected due in part to the Delta variant) to worries about inflation. For the Fed, consumer caution could mean pressure to stay dovish and not make borrowing conditions any tougher. Of course, the European Central Bank (ECB) recently said it was going to trim its bond purchases, and central banks often act in concert, so to speak. The main thing for investors to keep in mind going into the Fed meeting is that trading often slows as the Fed meets, so perhaps expect less exciting markets over the next two days. While trading might be slow for a day or two, volatility could be higher over the next month if you pay attention to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX). While it moved above the long-term average of 20 on Friday, it went higher than 26 this morning. This move might raise some eyebrows and be a warning sign of more stock market trouble ahead. Time And Materials Some of the weakest performers on Friday included Materials companies in the mining and metals sub-sectors (see more below). Even before Monday’s open, U.S. Steel (NYSE:X) saw shares melt down 7% or more during Friday’s session. This pain for investors in the steel giant came despite the company delivering what looked like strong guidance earlier in the week and talking about possibilities of a record Q3. Some of the pressure, research firm Briefing.com said, could reflect construction plans for new capacity that might weigh on prices, along with worries about the progress of the infrastructure bill in Congress. Failure to pass it would probably hurt the entire Materials sector, which might explain wider pressure in Materials on Friday. Nucor (NYSE:NUE), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), and Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) were other Materials stocks taking a dive late last week. CHART OF THE DAY: DOLLAR’S MOVE. After a series of higher lows since late June, the U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY—candlestick) looks like it could be trying to break above its resistance level (upper yellow line). On Friday it closed just above that level and has moved sharply higher this morning. Data source: ICE Data Services. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. A Taxing Question: If you’ve watched the financial news media lately, you probably know about the capital gains tax debate in Washington. House Democrats propose a 25% tax on dividends and capital gains, while the White House wants to slap a 39.6% tax on those for the highest earners. It’s unclear which (if either) proposal will be in the ultimate legislation, but either could mean a significantly higher tax bill for wealthy investors, who currently pay 20% on both capital gains and dividends. Earlier this year when the tax talk surfaced, we discussed its possible implications on the markets. Investors mostly seemed to consider that issue “out of sight, out of mind” over the summer, but now it’s back on speed dial. As an investor, these things are pretty much outside of your hands (though you could write to your congressperson if you really feel concerned). Analysts say some of the recent pressure on stocks could reflect investors taking profit so they can pay the current tax, not a higher one down the road (though some proposals would tax gains retroactively back to April 2021). The important thing is to keep your head and not overreact by selling or buying without doing your homework. First of all, make sure you’re even going to be affected by these proposed higher taxes. Remember, Democrats have said that any higher taxes won’t affect people making less than $400,000 a year. Second, understand that capital gains and dividend taxes are moving targets that go up and down over the years. Higher rates could conceivably hurt the market and some investors, or maybe not. The maximum capital gains tax rate was 28% between 1986 and 1997, and it corresponded with a huge market rally that lasted most of those years—the SPX quadrupled over that time span. Midas Metals Losing The Midas Touch? If you’ve been hedging your portfolio with gold and silver exposure via mining stocks, then last Thursday might have been a huge upset. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) and Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) were down 4.39% and 3.95% respectively. While these two took a good beating, many among the “smaller” billionaire market cappers got absolutely clobbered, like Coeur Mining (NYSE:CDE) and Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL), down 13.5% and 9% respectively. So, what’s with the Thursday beat-down? Considering the so-called “safe haven” status of precious metals and their miners, the industry tends to get a bit jumpy on economic data, and that’s likely what happened. While analysts expected an August Retail sales report of -0.8%, the +0.7% surprise was enough to make optimism jump, and precious metals (and their miners) plummet. Can we say there’s not enough “fear” in the market to seek safety? If so, that can be a good or bad thing. Plus, the anticipation of a stronger dollar can be enough to keep the gold and silver industry down. But don’t discount King Midas just yet. If anything, he’s known for exhibiting near-infinite patience. Well, maybe not infinite, but enough to have lasted a few millennia. It’s A Roll Of The Dice. That old expression about dice may be true for casino patrons, but now for casino owners and shareholders with exposure to China as well. Already smarting from the pandemic that kept global gamblers away from the Blackjack tables, now comes the wide-ranging crackdown in China, this time with gaming-mecca Macau in its crosshairs. Last week Chinese officials said they would change casino regulations to tighten restrictions on operators, as well as appoint government representatives to supervise companies. Casino Operator Las Vegas Sands (NYSE:LVS) has made a big bet on China. Melco Resorts & Entertainment (NASDAQ:MLCO) also relies on operations in Macau for revenue. Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) operates two casinos in Macau and also has a lot to lose if Macau’s gambling business declines. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM), maybe not so much. Most of its revenue still comes from its US-based gambling operations. Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) has no exposure to Macau, ditto for casino operator Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR). This year has seen China crack down on industries including education, ride-hailing services, gaming, and more. Analysts are expecting more to come.

2021-09-20,Major Indices Fall On Chinese Real Estate Debt: Eyes Are On Fed,"It was “manic Monday” on Wall Street. In a blunt and unpleasant reminder of how crises thousands of miles away can puncture the heart of the U.S. markets, a real estate crisis in Hong Kong took much of the blame for the sharpest daily losses in more than two months for the major U.S. indices. The so-called “horsemen of risk” like bonds, volatility, the U.S. dollar, and “defensive” stock sectors climbed back into the saddle after months of lazing around the corral. While analysts mainly cited the issues around Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer Evergrande Group and whether Beijing will let the debt-laden firm fail, that wasn’t the only issue sending a shudder around the world today. Though it should be noted that a default could mean potentially billions in losses for shareholders and bondholders not just in Asia but throughout the globe. Reuters reported that Evergrande bonds were trading for 29 cents on the dollar on Monday. The Spillover Effect The news came on top of continued concerns that there could be ripple effects for the rest of the global economy as the Chinese government continues to tap down on its real estate and other industries that it’s been trying to rein in. This includes technology, gambling, and video games. Remember, markets in China were closed on Monday for a holiday, so we could see increased action and volatility overnight when the market opens tonight. Worries about the default and its possible side effects could help explain why Financial stocks in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) were among those taking the most heat Monday. Also, Energy got clobbered as crude sank amid global growth fears. Crude oil futures (/CL) tested the $70 level before moving a little higher on a down day. And the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) traded above 28 but fell to just below 25 at the close. Materials took a major punch, with stocks like Freeport McMoRan (NYSE:FCX), Nucor (NYSE:NUE) among the worst-performing S&P 500 stocks amid concerns about possible slower global growth and what that might do to the price of raw materials. Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) were some of the Energy sector victims in Monday’s downturn. Meanwhile, In Washington ... Back at home, worries keep growing in Washington, D.C., as the House prepares to vote this week on the debt ceiling and a stopgap spending measure to keep the government operating past the end of the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. Along with that, the Fed starts its two-day meeting tomorrow. Last month, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell made clear that the central bank plans to start easing its stimulative bond-buying sometime soon, perhaps this year. Following that, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it would lower the amount of its own stimulus. The prospect of central banks starting to pull back the punch bowl even as global economic fears loom larger could be a factor not just in today’s selloff, but in the overall weakness that we’ve seen through much of September. It’s less likely we’ll hear taper talk any time soon as the Fed tries to determine if the Evergrande event is simply flushing out speculators or is a launching pad for something bigger. Talking Technicals From a technical perspective, a lot of damage got done on the charts today. The SPX took out its 50-day moving average pretty quickly, and that’s a level that had been holding firm for months. It takes more than a single day’s close below a key moving average to determine if the technical pattern is changing. Back in May, the SPX had several closes in a row below the 50-day but managed to claw back and resume its rally. We’ll have to watch closely to see if that level—which was 4436 coming into Monday—comes back into play over the next day or two. “Buy the dip” has been the rally call on Wall Street all year, and analysts say there’s plenty of cash still on the sidelines. You can’t assume one day of weakness, or even weakness for half a month like we’ve seen means anything about the longer-term trend. One level that was being watched Monday was near 4370, which the SPX brushed against twice in August during a short weak period before beginning to rally again later that month. By the end of the day, the SPX had fallen below 4370 to post its weakest levels since mid-July. The July low of 4233 is still a way lower. But the 100-day moving average is near 4330, and the SPX fell well below that in intraday trade before popping back toward the end of the day. It’s important after a day like this to watch the overnight trading and get a sense of whether buyers come in and try to make a stand. Sometimes weakness begets weakness, so to speak, and early the day after a selloff you see more selling in the first half-hour. It’s what happens after that, really, that might matter more. To buy the dip or not buy the dip is the question anyone active in the market could be contemplating. In a development that may be favors the bulls, major indices closed well off their lows Monday, scrambling back in the last half hour. It was still a really ugly day, but maybe the slight rebound suggests some positive sentiment that could give things a little more zip tomorrow. CHART OF THE DAY: S&P 500 DIPS. The S&P 500 Index (SPX—candlestick) has experienced consistent buying on the dips over the last year, but a new low suggests a long, overdue correction. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices.

2021-09-23,"5 Covered Call Trade Ideas - Targets 5%+ By Oct 8, 2021","Are you a dividend investor? What if I told you there was a way to double, or even triple your income without incurring much risk. In this article, I’ll introduce you to 5 covered call trade ideas on quality companies - dividend aristocrats that will do just that. I've organized the trade ideas from the smallest annualized return to the highest. Also, the call options expire soon - on Oct 8st, 2021. So, double-check the numbers, and commissions, before making any trade. Finally, these covered call trade ideas all have at least a 90% chance of expiring worthless. I also made sure that there’s no earnings release or dividend payout up to and including the expiration. Now you might be wondering, what do I know about selling covered calls? Well, I’m not a financial advisor or licensed in any way to provide investment advice. Rather, I’m an active trader and have sold covered call options profitably, for nearly 20 years. And the trade ideas in this article are for informational purposes only, so they are not a suggestion to buy or sell. What Is A Covered Call? A covered call is a contract that you can sell, and collect a premium on. The option premium is the income you get to keep. The call option gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation to BUY a specific underlying security from you, at a specific price - known as the strike price, at ANY point until the option expires. So, if the stock trades above the strike price at expiration, you’ll have to sell your stocks. And if it doesn’t, you get to keep the income and the stocks. Also, each call option contract is good for 100 shares of the underlying security. So, if you sell 1 contract, you’ll need to have at least 100 shares of the stock for the call option to be covered. 5 Covered Call Trade Ideas The covered call trade ideas in this article all have Dividend Aristocrats as their underlying security. Dividend aristocrats are a group of 65 stocks in the S&P 500 Index that have raised their dividends for more than 25 consecutive years. They are among the best dividend stocks investors can buy, and hold over the long term. They also have a number of key characteristics in common. First, they are leaders in their industry. Next, they have shareholder-friendly management teams that prioritize raising dividends. And finally, they have long-term growth potential due to their competitive advantages. Covered Call Trade Idea #1: Exxon Mobile (NYSE:XOM) Alright, so let’s begin with Exxon Mobile - the largest oil company in the US. Exxon operates three large business segments. First is the Upstream segment which includes oil and gas exploration and production. Second, are downstream activities that include refining and marketing. And last, manufactured chemicals which include aromatics, polyethylene, and polypropylene plastics. For this trade idea, if you own at least 100 shares in XOM, the call option with a $59 strike price could be interesting. It’ll give you $13 in covered call income at the midpoint, which represents a 5.19% annual return, and it has more than a 92% of expiring worthless. To make the trade, open your brokerage account and sell to open 1 or more contracts of XOM with a $59 strike and October 8, 2021 expiry. Set a limit price of $0.13 a share. And since 1 contract is for 100 shares, it means you’ll collect $13, minus commissions when the order fills. Covered Call Trade Idea #2: Nucor (NYSE:NUE) The next covered call trade idea in this article is on Nucor - the largest steel producer in North America. Nucor’s headquarters are in Charlotte, North Carolina, and has a market cap of $17 billion. The company currently operates in three segments: Steel Mills - the largest segment by revenue, Steel Products, and Raw Materials. For this trade idea, the call option with a $119 strike could be interesting. It’ll give you $23 in covered call income at the midpoint, which represents a 5.21% annual return, and has more than a 95% of expiring worthless. To make the trade, open your brokerage account and sell to open 1 or more contracts of NUE with a $119 strike and October 8th, 2021 expiry. Set a limit price of $0.23 so that you’ll collect $23 minus commissions when the order fills. Covered Call Trade Idea #3: V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC) V.F. Corporation (VFC) is next on the list and is a Dividend Aristocrat as it has increased its dividend for 48 years in a row. V.F. Corp increases its dividend each year, including 2020 which was a very difficult year for the company, and the broader economy, due to the coronavirus pandemic. They are also a giant in the clothing industry. The company’s annual sales exceed $10 billion and has a market cap of over $26 Billion. So, for this trade idea, if you own at least 100 shares in VF Corporation, a call option with a $73 strike price could be interesting. It’ll give you $18 in covered call income at the midpoint, which represents a 5.89% annual return, and has more than a 91% of expiring worthless. To make the trade, open your brokerage account and sell to open 1 or more contracts of VFC with a $73 strike price, that expires on October 8, 2021. You can set a limit price of $0.18 a share and since 1 contract is for 100 shares. And, it means you’ll collect $18 minus commissions when the order fills. Covered Call Trade Idea #4: Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) The next trade is on Caterpillar Inc. - a company that got founded in 1925 and joined the Dividend Aristocrats list in 2019. It’s impressive because Caterpillar operates in a highly cyclical industry, which normally prevents companies from having long histories of annual dividend increases. Not so with Caterpillar, as their management team has proven its commitment to returning cash to shareholders even when times are tough. Caterpillar also has incredibly competitive advantages that allow it to raise its dividend each year, even through downturns in the global economy. So, for this trade idea, if you own at least 100 shares in Caterpillar, the call option with a $207.50 strike price could be interesting. It’ll give you $51 in covered call income at the midpoint, which represents a 5.99% annual return, and has more than a 90% of expiring worthless. To make the trade, open your brokerage account and sell to open 1 or more contracts of CAT with the $207.50 strike price, that expires on October 8, 2021. You can set a limit price of $0.51 a share. And since 1 contract is for 100 shares, it means you’ll collect $51 minus commissions when the order is filled. Covered Call Trade Idea #5: IBM (NYSE:IBM) The last and highest yielding trade idea is IBM - a global tech company that provides integrated enterprise solutions for software, hardware, and services. In the services business, IBM is the world’s largest IT provider with a 5.5% market share. In software, IBM’s software business connects applications and devices to each other. And, In hardware, IBM sells the z15 mainframes, storage, and Power-based servers. For this trade idea, the call option with a $146 strike could be interesting.

To make the trade, open your brokerage account and sell to open 1 or more contracts of IBM with a $146 strike and October 8, 2021 expiry. And as always, set a limit price of $0.38 so that you’ll collect $38 minus commissions when the order is filled.

2021-10-06,"Goldman Sachs Downgrades US Steel, Upgrades Cleveland-Cliffs Ahead Of Steel Market Mean Reversion","U.S. steel prices have skyrocketed in 2021, and steel stocks have mostly followed suit. One major Wall Street firm adjusted its coverage of steel stocks on Wednesday ahead of an anticipated correction in the steel market in the months ahead. The Steel Analyst: Goldman Sachs analyst Emily Chieng made the following adjustments to her steel stock coverage: United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X) downgraded from Neutral to Sell, price target cut from $34 to $21. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) downgraded from Buy to Neutral, price target cut from $123 to $108. Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) upgraded from Sell to Neutral, price target raised from $31 to $33. Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF) upgraded from Neutral to Buy, price target cut from $26 to $24. Related Link: 2 Copper Stocks To Buy Right Now The Steel Thesis: In the new note, Goldman raised its 2021/2022 hot rolled coil (HRC) steep price forecasts from $1,399/$950 per ton to $1,572/$1,013 per ton. In the longer-term Goldman reiterated its $700-per-ton price forecast for 2023 and beyond. “In spite of our positive longer term outlook relative to historical levels, we note that the path towards our higher normalized price forecast must trend lower at some point,” Chieng said. Given expectations of a softening in steel prices, Chieng recommended investors take a more defensive approach to steel stocks heading into the fourth quarter. She is bearish on U.S. Steel largely due to its negative free cash flow. For Nucor, Chieng said the stock’s additional upside is limited following its 105.9% gain in the past year. Commercial Metals shares have lagged steel stock peers, and Chieng said the company has relatively low HRC exposure. In addition, she said auto contract repricing, accelerated deleveraging and a discounted valuation make Cleveland-Cliffs an attractive buy at current levels. Benzinga’s Take: Benzinga’s Take: The VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX) is already up 65% in the past year, so the excess cash flow generated from higher prices in the industry may already be priced into the stocks to a large degree. The big question for steel stock investors is when steel prices start to pull back and how deep that pullback will be."
2021-10-12,Cramer Says Macy's Could Reach $30 If This Happens,"On CNBC’s “Mad Money Lightning Round, Jim Cramer said he liked Macy’s Inc (NYSE:M) very much, but that it was not a highflyer. CEO Jeff Gennette was doing a phenomenal job and the stock could reach $30 if the vaccination drive picks up the pace and reaches where it should have, he added. Although the stock has moved, the rally isn’t over. Noodles & Company (NASDAQ:NDLS) has been around. Although it seems like the company is making a comeback, it’s been “two steps forward, two steps back,” Cramer said. “I’m not going there,” he added. Cramer noted Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) had “fallen out of favor.” Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is stiff competition for the company. Chewy offers specialized treatment and it’s a good stock, he said. “I’m not going to back away from Chewy,” Cramer commented. ChargePoint (NYSE:CHPT) is out of favor, Cramer said. He recommended owning the stock “strictly as a speculation, nothing else.” For those seeking to invest in infrastructure, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is better than Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Cramer said. However, he added that he liked Caterpillar."
2021-10-19,Nucor's Debt Overview,"Shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) increased by 9.46% in the past three months. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Nucor has. Nucor's Debt Based on Nucor's balance sheet as of August 11, 2021, long-term debt is at $5.28 billion and current debt is at $112.71 million, amounting to $5.39 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $2.72 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $2.67 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Nucor has $23.00 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.23. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 35% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Debt Is Important Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

Nucor said steel mills earnings remain robust and are expected to be comparable to the third quarter despite lower volumes caused by year-end seasonality. The company said raw materials earnings are expected to decrease in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter primarily due to margin compression at its direct reduced iron facilities. As we approach the end of the most profitable year in Nucor's history, demand continues to be strong in most of the end markets we serve. We are confident that 2022 will be another year of strong profitability for Nucor, the company said. See Also: Why Eli Lilly Shares Are Rising Today Nucor manufactures steel and steel products.

2022-01-03,"5 ETFs To With Major Growth Potential In January And Beyond, From Sports Betting To The Metaverse","The year 2021 left behind some huge storylines for investors. The investment themes may carry over into 2022, which could make some thematic ETFs worth considering in January and further into the year. Here is a look at five ETFs for investors to consider in 2022. Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF (NYSE:BETZ) Launched: June 2020 Assets Under management: $287 million Price: $24.82 52-Week Range: $22.55 to $33.26 Year-to-date: -4% The Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF offers pure-play exposure to a high growth, well publicized storyline for investors and sports fans. More states are legalizing sports betting and more sports and teams are partnering with betting companies. After a strong 2020, this ETF ended 2021 down on the year. The company counts many international names in the top 10 holdings including Kindred Group, Kambi Group, Flutter Entertainment (OTC:PDYPY) and Entain. Rush Street Interactive (NYSE:RSI), Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) and DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) also rank in the top 10 holdings. While there is some risk of sports pausing their seasons or delaying their games, sometimes a schedule change can work out as a positive with more dates for bettors to wager on. The ETF and its holdings should get plenty of headlines in early January, with the NCAA Football Championship Game coming on Jan. 10, 2022. The ETF could also benefit from the NFL’s Super Bowl, which will be played on Feb. 13, 2022. Last year’s Super Bowl set a sports betting handle record and saw heavy customer acquisition promotions by company’s to boost user totals. Related Link: Exclusive: BETZ ETF Co-Founder Talks Sports Betting Market, DraftKings, Barstool Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (BATS:PAVE) Launched: March 2017 Assets Under Management: $5.5 billion Price: $28.60 52-Week Range: $20.70 to $29.26 Year-to-date: +33.7% A strong performer in 2021, the infrastructure themed ETF could be set up for a strong 2022 with increased government spending and contract wins likely coming to many of its top holdings. The ETF is up 121% over the last three years and has been a strong performer. Top holdings include Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE), Eaton Corp (NYSE:ETN), Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC), Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) and Trane Technologies (NYSE:TT). Defiance Digital Revolution ETF (NYSE:NFTZ) Launched: December 2021 Assets Under Management: $10 million Price: $20.18 52-Week Range: $17.90 to $20.32 Year-to-date: N/A The relatively new Digital Revolution ETF from Defiance is likely to get some attention heading into the new year. The pure play ETF holds a basket of stocks of companies that have entered the non-fungible token space or announced plans to enter the sector. The ETF will also hold cryptocurrency mining and cryptocurrency banking related companies. The ETF will rebalance on a quarterly basis. The fund’s initial makeup was broken down as 32.5% NFT stocks, 25.9% cryptocurrency mining stocks, 21.9% cryptocurrency asset management and trading stocks, 15.2% crypto banking, payments and services stocks and 4.6% blockchain technology stocks. Top holdings in the ETF include Plby Group (NASDAQ:PLBY), Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF), Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) and Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). Until investors have the opportunity to put money into an ETF that holds NFTs directly similar to a DAO, this could be the next best option for pure-play exposure. ProShares Online Retail ETF (NYSE:ONLN) Launched: July 2018 Assets Under Management: $709 million Price: $57.31 52-Week Range: $54.59 to $93.45 Year-to-date: -24.1% January will likely be the time investors and retailers find out exactly how good the holiday shopping quarter was. One trend that hasn’t seemed to go away is the shift to buying and selling items online instead of venturing to physical stores. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated growth for online retailers and showed just how easy and convenient it could be to buy items like groceries online and holiday shopping as well. This ETF counts Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) as its two largest holdings at 26.4% and 10.7%, making the fund a big bet on two top global ecommerce companies. Other top holdings include eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Sea Ltd (NYSE:SE). While Amazon had a strong 2021, Alibaba shares have been hit hard by concerns over Chinese public companies. The ETF could have several storylines in 2022 with the strength of the 2021 holiday shopping season among the largest. Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSE:META) Launched: June 2021 Assets Under Management: $897 million Price: $15.60 52-Week Range: $13.75 to $17.11 Year-to-date: N/A In half a year, the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF has generated almost $1 billion in assets under management. The ETF is the first pure play ETF with exposure to the growth of the metaverse, a term that has increased in search results and implied long-term valuation. Top holdings of the ETF include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Unity Software (NYSE:U). As interest in the metaverse continues, the companies that are considered winners of the sector's growth could be in for a strong 2022 and benefit this pure-play ETF."

2022-01-05,Why Joe Terranova Bought Nucor Stock Today,"Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) looks like it's breaking out of a technical formation following about two months of consolidation. Virtus Investment Partners' Joe Terranova initiated a position Wednesday as he expects the stock to perform well in 2022. This is a cheap stock and this is a stock that is breaking out technically and its liquidating the pessimism, Terranova said on CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report. Terranova's Thesis: When the company released its earnings expectations for the fourth quarter of 2021, the stock sold off and that was the time to buy it, Terranova said. However, he still thinks it should be bought at current levels because of the liquidation of pessimism. See Also: 8 Materials Stocks Moving In Wednesday's Intraday Session Steel prices peaked in the middle of 2021 and they aren't expected to recover so expectations have come down, he said. With the stock breaking out to the upside, the pessimism surrounding the name is easing. I'm very willing to step into that trade right here with the stock trading somewhere around $125, Terranova said. I think it goes a lot higher. I really do.

2022-02-22,15 Stocks To Watch During Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"President Joe Biden is expected to announce a new set of sanctions Tuesday against Russia after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into two separatist pro-Moscow regions in eastern Ukraine after recognizing their independence on Monday. Biden has indicated that the United States will take action if necessary, leaving American investors worried about the potential fallout. What Happened: Tensions between Russia and Ukraine are soaring, causing global markets to sink — most notably the Russian MOEX, the main exchange in Moscow. The MOEX is down 19.93% year-to-date. The S&P 500 is down 9.67%, while China’s SSE Composite Index is down 4.82% year-to-date. Russia and Ukraine are known for producing wheat and grain. If sanctions are imposed, both countries will suffer supply chain disruptions, causing the prices of agricultural exports to rise further than their current levels. Why It's Important: The disruptions in the supply chain can present a unique opportunity for American companies who provide farmers with equipment to sell more products domestically. As an example, Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) can benefit from its grain trading. The following are agricultural, material, defense, cybersecurity and crypto stocks to watch if the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues. Agriculture: John Deere (NYSE:DE) Bunge Limited (NYSE:BG) Calavo Growers (NASDAQ:CVGW) Materials: United States Steel (NYSE:X) Cleveland-Cliffs (NYSE:CLF) Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) Defense: Lockheed-Martin (NYSE:LMT) Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) Cyber Security: CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) Crypto: Riot Blockchain (NASDAQ:RIOT) Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) HIVE Blockchain Technologies (NASDAQ:HIVE)"

2022-03-02,36 Stocks To Watch After Biden's First State of The Union Address,"President Joe Biden hosted his first State of the Union Address Tuesday in front of members of Congress. In the speech, Biden discussed several items that he has already helped pass along with more future initiatives. Here is a look at stocks to watch after the State of the Union address. Pharmaceutical Companies: In 2016, then- Vice President Biden launched the Cancer Moonshot program the help boost spending on medical research to take on various types of cancer. In 2022, Biden announced plans to boost spending and reduce the death rate from cancer by 50% over the next 25 years. The Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies includes 11 companies working to boost treatments for various types of cancers. The companies are AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Amgen Inc (NASDAQ:AMGN), Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY), Celgene (owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb), Genetech (owned by Roche), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Janssen Research (owned by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)), Novartis (NYSE:NVS), Sanofi SA (NASDAQ:SNY) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE). Biden announced his Unity Agenda, which included ending cancer as we know it as one of four bipartisan issues that can be passed. Social Media: Biden took aim at social media platforms and the data collected from children. “It’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, and demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.” The comment could be aimed at companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR). A push to change data collection and advertising could hurt advertising revenue down the road for the companies. Gun Stocks: Biden used the State of the Union address to address gun control. Biden called on Congress to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and repeal a law that protects gun manufacturers from being sued. The comments could be good and bad for gun stocks as any hint of banning weapons could lead to increased sales, while the potential right to sue gun manufacturers could also increase the need for more insurance paid by gun companies and the potential to pay out millions in lawsuit settlements. Gun stocks include Smith & Wesson Brands (NASDAQ:SWBI), Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO) and Sturm, Ruger & Co (NYSE:RGR). Increased gun sales could also boost retailers that sell them, such as American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ:AOUT). Related Link: 5 Things You Might Not Know About Joe Biden Body Cameras: Biden praised the Justice Department for requiring police body cameras. Body camera companies include Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) and Motorola Solutions Inc (NYSE:MSI). COVID-19 Tests: Following up on a plan to provide free at-home COVID-19 tests, Biden shared plans for Americans to once again receive free tests from the U.S. government. Companies that make COVID-19 tests include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Quidel Corp (NASDAQ:QDEL) and Orasure Technologies (NASDAQ:OSUR). Pharmacies: Along with at-home COVID-19 tests, Biden announced the launch of “test to treat,” an initiative that will allow Americans to get tested at a pharmacy. If they test positive they will receive antiviral pills “on the spot at no costs.” This initiative could provide a traffic and sales boost to pharmacy companies that include CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Rite Aid Corp (NYSE:RAD). Pfizer’s Paxlovid, an antiviral oral treatment for COVID-19, was also singled out during the speech. Insulin Costs: Biden said he wants to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month, making it more affordable for consumers. The leading insulin providers are Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), Sanofi and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). Electric Vehicles: Biden used a portion of the State of the Union to discuss his plan to combat climate change, which includes lowering the price of electric vehicles. Biden shouted out automotive companies Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and General Motors Corp (NYSE:GM) during his speech. “Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles — creating 11,000 jobs across the country. General Motors is making the largest investment in its history, $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan,” Biden said. The exclusion of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) from the speech prompted a response from CEO Elon Musk, as Tesla remains the leading producer of electric vehicles in the U.S. Infrastructure: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is on the path to fix over 65,000 miles of highway and help “rebuild America.” Biden highlighted the recent announcement that 1,500 bridges will be repaired across the U.S. this year. Companies that could benefit from increased infrastructure spending include Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT), Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), Vulcan Materials Co (NYSE:VMC), United States Steel (NYSE:X), Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc (NYSE:J). Intel Shoutout: Semiconductor company Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) got a shout out from Biden during the State of the Union speech. Intel is building two factories in Ohio, as part of the largest economic development in Ohio history. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was in attendance at the State of Union. Biden praised the plan as a way to help America from supply disruptions from other countries. The president called on Congress to provide billions of dollars in support for domestic semiconductor production for companies like Intel. Mental Health: Another pillar of the “Unity Agenda” was to better mental health care. One pure-play company in the mental health space is Talkspace Inc (NASDAQ:TALK), which provides virtual offerings with licensed mental health providers.

2022-05-09,Peering Into Nucor's Recent Short Interest,"Nucor's (NYSE:NUE) short percent of float has risen 8.79% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 8.91 million shares sold short, which is 3.34% of all regular shares that are available for trading.

Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

Comparing Nucor's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro, Nucor's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.29%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.

2022-07-06,Analyzing Nucor's Short Interest,"Nucor's (NYSE:NUE) short percent of float has fallen 9.97% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 8.36 million shares sold short, which is 3.16% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.8 days to cover their short positions on average. Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish. See Also: List of the most shorted stocks Nucor Short Interest Graph (3 Months) As you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Nucor has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted. Comparing Nucor's Short Interest Against Its Peers Peer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis. According to Benzinga Pro, Nucor's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 4.96%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers. Did you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it..

2022-07-07,Why Jim Cramer Prefers This Home Builder Stock To Skyline Champion,"On CNBC’s Mad Money Lightning Round, Jim Cramer said Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) can go higher, but he is not recommending any Chinese shares.

2022-07-14,Death Cross Looms Over Nucor Investors,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of Nucor (NYSE:NUE). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Nucor, which is trading around $107.74 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at Nucor's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q1 2022 Q4 2021 Q3 2021 Q2 2021 EPS Estimate 7.29 7.89 7.19 4.74 EPS Actual 7.67 7.97 7.28 5.15 Revenue Estimate 10.48B 10.55B 10.15B 8.31B Revenue Actual 10.49B 10.36B 10.31B 8.79B Also consider this overview of Nucor analyst ratings: Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2022-07-15,5 Value Stocks In The Basic Materials Sector,"What is a Value Stock? A value stock is traditionally defined in terms of how investors in the marketplace are valuing that company's future growth prospects. Low P/E multiples are good base indicators that the company is undervalued and can most likely be labelled as a value stock. Benzinga Insights has compiled a list of value stocks in the basic materials sector that may be worth watching: Huntsman (NYSE:HUN) - P/E: 5.3 Nucor (NYSE:NUE) - P/E: 3.91 Dow (NYSE:DOW) - P/E: 5.33 Mosaic (NYSE:MOS) - P/E: 6.19 Equinox Gold (AMEX:EQX) - P/E: 2.65 Huntsman's earnings per share for Q1 sits at $1.19, whereas in Q4, they were at 0.95. The company's most recent dividend yield sits at 2.39%, which has increased by 0.08% from 2.31% last quarter. This quarter, Nucor experienced a decrease in earnings per share, which was $7.97 in Q4 and is now $7.67. Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 1.54%, which has decreased by 0.09% from last quarter's yield of 1.63%. Most recently, Dow reported earnings per share at $2.34, whereas in Q4 earnings per share sat at $2.15. Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 4.43%, which has decreased by 0.09% from last quarter's yield of 4.52%.

Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 0.98%, which has decreased by 0.25% from last quarter's yield of 1.23%. Equinox Gold's earnings per share for Q1 sits at $-0.08, whereas in Q4, they were at 0.25. The Significance: A value stock may need some time to rebound from its undervalued position. The risk of investing in a value stock is that this emergence may never materialize."
2022-07-20,Nucor (NUE) Gears Up For Q2 Earnings: What's In The Cards?,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) is set to release second-quarter 2022 results ahead of the bell on Jul 21. The U.S. steel giant surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missed once. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 2.2%, on average. It posted an earnings surprise of around 4.4% in the last reported quarter. The company is likely to have benefited in the second quarter from strong end-market demand and higher year-over-year sales prices. Nucor's shares are up 26.2% over a year, compared with the industry's 22.4% decline. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. What do the Estimates Say? Nucor, last month, issued its earnings guidance for the second quarter. It anticipates a new record second-quarter earnings of between $8.75 and $8.85 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter consolidated revenues for Nucor is currently pegged at $11,420.9 million, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 29.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter average sales price per ton for the company's steel mills unit stands at $1,466, suggesting a 32.4% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for average sales price per ton for the company's steel products unit is pegged at $2,672, suggesting a year-over-year rise of 56.4%. A Few Factors to Watch The company's second-quarter results are likely to reflect strong end-market demand, especially in the non-residential construction market. Strong end-use market demand for steel and steel products is likely to have supported its results. Its steel products segment is expected to have benefited from strong demand in non-residential construction markets. Nucor, in June, said that it expects earnings in the steel mills segment to strengthen mainly due to higher profitability at its bar, sheet and plate mills. Its raw materials segment is also projected to generate increased profits in the second quarter due to relatively higher selling prices for raw materials. U.S. steel prices witnessed a significant downward correction during the second quarter. After surging to nearly $1,500 per short ton in April 2022 due to supply concerns stemming from the Russia-Ukraine war, the benchmark hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices are on a downward trend and have retreated to levels before the conflict. HRC prices have fallen below the $1,000 per short ton level. The downward drift partly reflects shorter lead times. Mills are also negotiating lower prices for new orders. Fears of a recession have also impacted prices. Nevertheless, higher year-over-year selling prices are likely to have aided Nucor's revenues and margins in the to-be-reported quarter.

2022-09-24,"Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur? Revisiting The Market Adage In Turbulent 2022","One old market adage that is commonly mentioned just ahead of the Jewish holidays is Sell Rosh Hashanah, Buy Yom Kippur. With the holidays commencing Sunday at sundown, it is time for this year's investment interpretation of the adage from the perspective of this investor. And boy, it is not easy. The 2022 holiday is certainly taking place during turbulent times in the U.S. and the world, and Friday’s price action is certainly not conjuring many bullish scenarios. Historical Origin: The rule's origin is based on the concept that followers of the Jewish faith want to be free from material possessions during the most sacred period of the calendar year. During the 10 days between the two major holidays, Jews reflect on their actions from the previous year and atone for their sins while setting a new agenda for the upcoming year. Upon completion of the cleansing process, they're free to return to the markets and evaluate investments for the upcoming year. Those who are ultra-religious may abstain from the markets altogether during this period. Mixed Results Over The Long-Term: No trading adage or strategy is 100% accurate over time. In 2021, following the original adage was a winning strategy. There was a rare occurrence last year when the market was closed for the Labor Day holiday. With Rosh Hashanah beginning at sundown on Monday, Sept. 6, the markets were closed. Therefore, the last trading day before the commencement of the holiday was Friday, Sept. 3, 2021. On that day, the S&P 500 cash index settled at 4,535.43. Following the 10 trading days and the conclusion of Yom Kippur on Thursday, Sept. 16, the first day to rebuy the index would have been on Friday, Sept. 17 at the opening price of 4,469.74. That marks a decline of 65.69 points or 1.5%, proving to be a winning strategy if employed in the aforementioned sequence. Of course, the index did go on to much higher prices until the beginning of the year, but if one was still holding the bag from that positioning, they would be deep in the red. With the cash index at 3,695, that makes for a decline of 774.74 points or 17%. Sell Rosh Hashanah Working Like A Charm: 2022 has been one of those rare years when “selling the rip” has been the right thing to do time and time again. Beginning with the first trading day of the year and until the late June low, the bears were in command. The bear market rally off that low took the cash index back to 4,325.28 in mid-August, but nearly all of those gains have withered away. A vast majority of the retreat has taken place following the worse-than-expected August CPI report that revealed inflation has not peaked. From the closing price (4,110.41) on Monday, Sept. 12 ahead of the report on Sept. 13 to its closing price (3,693.23), the index has skidded 417.18 points or 10.1%. The cash index is still roughly 26 points above its low close for the year at 3,666.77 Buy Yom Kippur? With the velocity with which the index has been falling, it could easily breach the June low on Monday. That is much sooner than the end of Yom Kippur, which is on Oct. 5. The next opportunity to repurchase the index according to the adage is on Oct. 6. At this time, it would take a brave soul to blindly initiate longs in a volatile bear market. The number of factors working against the market are numerous. Of course, the overbearing one is still increasing inflation, resulting in more interest rate hikes. The third-quarter earnings season is getting off to a rough start, even though it has not truly begun yet. This is evidenced by several companies already warning that earnings are going to come in below estimates. In the last week, the warnings have come from bellwethers for the economy FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F). Before that it was Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), which has been hammered since its guidance cut, falling from $140 to $104. The macroeconomic environment is in disarray with the war in Ukraine and tensions between Taiwan and China that may drag the U.S. into the conflict. Finally, the relentless move higher of the U.S. dollar is punishing other countries that depend on U.S. products, Last but not least, the TINA trade (There Is No Alternative) to the market is dead. The constantly rising interest is draining trillions of dollars out of the stock market in search of some kind of yield, even if it is well below the rate of inflation. Moving Forward: For those investors that were waiting to redeploy their assets at a test of the June low, Friday was pretty darn close to that for the S&P 500. The solid rebound into the close will have investors pondering if this was another “buy the dip” opportunity. From an overly optimistic viewpoint, the latter part of the old adage, Buy Yom Kippur may present investors with a lower-risk entry into the markets. Photo via Shutterstock."

2022-11-15,Jim Cramer Lists 6 'Cyclical Smokestack' Stocks Worth Owning: 'Customers Have No Choice But To Turn To Them',"The equity market is beginning to see a “fits-and-starts” recovery amid hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon start to pivot or at least pause in light of a thaw down in inflationary pressure. What Happened: CNBC’s “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer on Monday noted that a few cyclical stocks have “caught fire” recently, and these “cyclical smokestack” stocks could be worth owning. Cyclical stocks are those whose prices vary depending on the macroeconomic conditions and business cycles. Given the earnings of cyclical companies are tied to the fortunes of the economy, conventional wisdom dictates that investors should stay away from them in a recessionary environment, Cramer said. However, this time around, the Fed’s rate hikes are impacting tech stocks and speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies, he added. See Also: Jim Cramer Says Get Out Of Cloud Sector On This Rally, But These 3 Stocks Are Worth Keeping “That means it’s possible the central bank doesn’t need to raise rates enough for industrial stocks to also get crushed,” the stock picker said. He also sees secular trends such as the travel boom and favorable legislation pushing these stocks higher. “These are great companies that have positioned themselves in some terrific end markets and dominated their industries to the point where potential customers have no choice but to turn to them,” Cramer said. Cramer’s Cyclical Stock Picks: he CNBC host recommended buying the following cyclical stocks: Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) Caterpillar, Inc. (NYSE:CAT) Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) Dow, Inc. (NYSE:DOW) Honeywell International, Inc. (NYSE:HON) Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) Boeing and Honeywell have exposure to aerospace and could be beneficiaries of the travel boom, Cramer said. He expects Caterpillar, Deere and Nucor to capitalize on the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill.

2022-12-07,Congressional Trading Report: Rep. Virginia Foxx Sold Over $50K In Nucor Stock,"Representative Virginia Foxx from North Carolina reported a sale of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) stock, according to a December filing. The transaction took place on December 6, 2022. What Happened: A recent report from the House of Representatives Clerk's Office on December 6, 2022 reveals that Foxx made a sale of Nucor stock valued between $50,001 - $100,000. Nucor shares are trading down 0.69% at $151.93 at the time of writing. The Importance of Congressional Transactions Congressional transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however, they can be an important factor for an investor to consider. A Congressional transaction is when any Representative or Senator either buys or sells an individual stock. Anyone working in Congress must file a Periodic Transaction Report to inform the public of their recent transaction within 30 days of being notified of the transaction and within 45 days of the transaction date. When a Senator or Representative makes a new purchase, that could be an indication that they expect the stock to rise. A sale, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean that the seller thinks the stock will go down. In April 2012, Former President Barack Obama signed the STOCK Act into law. The act prohibits members of Congress from using private information given to them by their position for personal gain such as buying or selling a stock. The act also expanded disclosure requirements for members of Congress by requiring them to file a monthly disclosure. Trade Recap A December filing states that North Carolina Representative Virginia Foxx sold shares of Nucor. The exact amount of the transaction remained unknown but the filing states a range of $50,001 - $100,000. This article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor."

Following are his two picks: 1. Corteva Inc (NYSE:CTVA): Cramer advised investors should buy the seeds and agricultural chemical company stock on its next pullback. He believes that strong crop prices this year have left farmers flush with cash and they are more likely to invest in efficient farming. “Plus, even though the stock’s up 23% for the year, it still sells for less than 19 times next year’s earnings estimates — far from expensive,” he said. 2. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE): Cramer terms Nucor the “best steelmaker in America.” The expert said he is certain the stock will have an up year in 2023 as it continues posting strong earnings despite the Federal Reserve’s tightening. Nucor will also be a huge beneficiary of the over $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, Cramer predicted according to the report. “Remember, a year ago the analysts thought Nucor could only make $16 in 2022 and they ended up trouncing those estimates. I wouldn’t be surprised if they put on a repeat performance,” he said.

2023-04-13,This Senator Just Sold Up To $100K In Nucor Stock,"The Office of Senator Gary C Peters has reported a sale of Nucor (NYSE:NUE) stock on April 12, 2023. According to the April filing, the transaction was made on April 12, 2023. What Happened: A recent report from the U.S. Senate's Office on April 12, 2023 reveals that Peters made a sale of Nucor stock valued between $50,001 - $100,000. Nucor shares are trading down 0.45% at $146.99 at the time of writing. Why Congressional Transactions Matter Congressional transactions shouldn't be used primarily to make an investing decision, however, they can be an important factor for an investor to consider. A Congressional transaction is when any Representative or Senator either buys or sells an individual stock. Anyone working in Congress must file a Periodic Transaction Report to inform the public of their recent transaction within 30 days of being notified of the transaction and within 45 days of the transaction date. When a Senator or Representative makes a new purchase, that could be an indication that they expect the stock to rise. A sale, on the other hand, can be made for a variety of reasons, and may not necessarily mean that the seller thinks the stock will go down. In April 2012, Former President Barack Obama signed the STOCK Act into law. The act prohibits members of Congress from using private information given to them by their position for personal gain such as buying or selling a stock. The act also expanded disclosure requirements for members of Congress by requiring them to file a monthly disclosure. Trade Recap A April filing states that Senator Gary C Peters sold shares of Nucor. The exact amount of the transaction remained unknown but the filing states a range of $50,001 - $100,000.

2023-04-20,"Mortgage Rates Up, Mortgage Demand Down","The US Treasury has $252 billion in cash on hand to fund government operations. Google, Microsoft, and Apple combined had more cash on hand at the end of last year. Market Prices as of 4 pm EST, 4/19/23 Macro House Speaker Kevin McCarthy proposed a bill to raise the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion for a year. The plan calls for a $130 billion reduction in federal spending, including cuts to Covid funds, tougher work requirements for anti-poverty benefits, easier regulations for energy projects, and an end to some tax breaks for clean-energy projects (like EVs). McCarthy says the bill would save taxpayers $4.5 billion over 10 years. Democrats immediately rejected the plan. The Fed’s latest anecdotal Beige Book report showed little change in overall economic activity in recent weeks. It revealed slight easing in the labor market as wages moderate from admittedly elevated levels. Overall price rose during the period but the pace of increases has slowed. The report also showed tightening lending standards and declining lending volumes and loan demand. US mortgage rates increased by the most in 2 months last week, rising to 6.43%. Demand for mortgage applications fell 10% from the previous week, the biggest drop since February. Meanwhile, a new Redfin report reveals median US home sale prices experienced their biggest YoY drop since 2012, falling 3.3% in March from a year earlier. Redfin Stocks Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’ vendetta with Disney rages on. A DeSantis-appointed oversight board plans to cancel agreements made under previous leadership allowing the company to control land near its theme parks. If canceled, the +60-year agreement would hinder Disney’s ability to expand its resort. A legal fight is likely as experts argue voiding the contract could violate state contract and zoning laws."

2023-09-05,P/E Ratio Insights for Nucor,"In the current market session, Nucor Inc. (NYSE:NUE) stock price is at $170.24, after a 1.36% drop. However, over the past month, the company's stock increased by 0.19%, and in the past year, by 25.54%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Nucor P/E Ratio Analysis in Relation to Industry Peers The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Nucor has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 111.94 of the Metals & Mining industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. In conclusion, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric for analyzing a company's market performance, but it has its limitations. While a lower P/E can indicate that a company is undervalued, it can also suggest that shareholders do not expect future growth. Additionally, the P/E ratio should not be used in isolation, as other factors such as industry trends and business cycles can also impact a company's stock price. Therefore, investors should use the P/E ratio in conjunction with other financial metrics and qualitative analysis to make informed investment decisions."
2023-09-07,"US, EU Join Forces To Tackle China's Steel Surplus, Reshaping Trump-Era Tariffs","The U.S. and the EU are on the verge of a groundbreaking partnership aimed at countering China’s burgeoning steel surplus. This audacious move not only seeks to curb excess steel production, but also aims to bury the hatchet on a long-standing trade dispute that traces its roots back to the Trump administration. Taking on China’s Steel Overproduction At the heart of this agreement lies the intent to introduce fresh tariffs, primarily targeting imports from China that have thrived due to non-market practices, as Bloomberg reported Thursday. Negotiations are still underway. Crucial details such as the scope of these tariffs and potential targets in other countries were not immediately unclear. Furthermore, this accord is designed to set a framework that invites other nations to join in the future, potentially reshaping the landscape of global steel trade. This new pact is an integral part of the broader Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminum, a negotiation that commenced in 2021 between the EU and the Biden administration. This negotiation aims to settle a dispute that first flared up when former President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on metal imports from Europe, citing national security concerns. Steelmakers Rallied in 2023 The most widely recognized exchange-traded fund (ETF) focusing on stocks from various sectors, including materials, metals, and mining, particularly steel, is the VanEck Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX). Over the past year, this fund has displayed impressive performance, delivering a remarkable 35% return, with a significant 16% increase year-to-date. The standout contributor to this outstanding performance has been POSCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PKX), which has surged by more than 100% year-to-date. Within the realm of U.S. steel producers, notable performances have been observed. U.S. Steel Corp. (NYSE:X) has seen a robust increase of 22% year-to-date, while Nucor Corp. (NYSE:NUE) has posted a substantial gain of 28% in the same period. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. (NYSE:RS) has outperformed with an impressive 32% year-to-date growth. Current Tariffs and Potential Implications Since 2018, the U.S. has imposed a 25% tariff on steel imports, with the EU implementing a similar duty on a range of steel imports under its safeguard measures. In 2021, both sides temporarily suspended punitive measures on each other’s goods, setting a deadline for finding a permanent solution by Oct. 31, 2023. Failure to reach an agreement would automatically resurrect Trump-era tariffs and EU retaliatory measures, impacting over $10 billion in exports. What Lies Ahead Talks regarding the Global Sustainable Agreement aim to prepare for a US-EU summit slated for late October, offering hope for a mutually beneficial understanding. This could have significant implications for Chinese steelmakers, who have been increasing their exports due to weak domestic demand and a depreciating yuan, making their exports more attractive.

2023-09-27,Pioneering Fusion Power Plant Collaboration - Nucor Partners With Helion Energy: Report,"Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE), a leading steelmaker, has reportedly unveiled plans to collaborate with fusion startup Helion Energy on establishing a 500-megawatt fusion power plant at one of its U.S. steel mills by 2030. This venture could generate enough electricity to supply hundreds of thousands of residences, comparable to a standard power station. Nucor is investing $35 million in Helion, which is backed by OpenAI Chief Executive Sam Altman, the WSJ reported. The report noted that the deal is a bet on fusion, a technology that hasn't yet produced electricity. Nucor is reportedly accelerating its green energy initiatives because it faces increasing demands for green steel, especially from major clients like General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) and cooling equipment manufacturer Trane Technologies Plc (NYSE:TT). We don't want to sit on the sidelines and wait for all these technologies and hope they get developed, the report quoted an interview by Leon Topalian, Nucor's chief executive. Recent advancements in fusion technology, particularly from the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, have rekindled optimism in fusion's commercial viability. The proposed fusion plant by Nucor and Helion is slated to have ten times the capacity of another Helion project aimed at supplying fusion-based electricity to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) by 2028, the report said. Helion's fundraising feats have raked in approximately $630 million, including the Nucor investment. Altman has invested $375 million in Helion, the report noted.
