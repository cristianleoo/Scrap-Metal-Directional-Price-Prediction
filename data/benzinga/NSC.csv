2018-01-23,The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500,"Last week I highlighted the Top 10 Value Stocks In The S&P 500 noting that value will have its day in the sun in 2018. This is not a widely held view considering the Russell 1000 Growth index (IWF) has returned 32.2% over the last year while the Russell 1000 Value index (IWD) has returned only 14.7%. Furthermore, high flying Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped to another all-time high after reporting Q4 numbers on Monday after the bell. Total subscriber growth increased 25.4% YoY which helped send the company's market cap to over $100 billion. The chart below highlights Netflix amazing growth as well as its -$510 million cash burn in Q4 (-$2 billion in fiscal year 2017). Source: Avory & Co. Netflix is a timely reminder of just how much momentum these growth stocks continue to have in this market, no matter what valuation multiple they trade at. And while research suggests owning high quality value stocks significantly outperforms in the long-run, high quality growth stocks (such as Netflix) still have steam. Therefore, I decided to find companies that may be masquerading around as high growth stocks but really are not to be trifled with. In order to find these pricey stocks, I downloaded the list of S&P 500 constituents and then used finbox.io's spreadsheet add-on to find which companies had the following: 1) a P/E multiple that trades above its comparable public companies, and 2) projected 5-year earnings growth that's below its comparable public companies. OR 3) an EBITDA multiple that trades above its comparable public companies, and 4) projected 5-year EBITDA growth that's below its comparable public companies. AND 5) has downside as calculated from finbox.io's fair value > 20%. Here are the 10 most expensive stocks in the S&P 500 that I found. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: ProLogis ProLogis Inc (NYSE:PLD) is a global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets. As of September 30, 2017, the company owned or had investments in properties and development projects expected to total approximately 687 million square feet in 19 countries. Prologis leases modern distribution facilities to a diverse base of approximately 5,200 customers across two major categories: business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment. Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes Duke Realty Corp (NYSE:DRE), DCT Industrial Trust Inc (NYSE:DCT), First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc (NYSE:FR) and EastGroup Properties Inc (NYSE:EGP). The company's LTM EBITDA multiple of 27.1x is above all of its selected comparable public companies: DRE (14.9x), DCT (24.8x), FR (19.8x) and EGP (22.7x). Therefore you would expect the company's future growth to be above its peer group. However, ProLogis' projected 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 4.8% is only above DRE (-3.7%) and below DCT (9.1%), FR (6.4%) and EGP (7.2%). Source: finbox.io Shares of the company are up 21.1% over the last year. The stock last traded at $63.11 as of Monday January 22 and eleven separate valuation analyses imply that there is significant downside relative to its current trading price. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Macerich Macerich Co (NYSE:MAC) is a fully integrated self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust, which focuses on the acquisition, leasing, and management of regional malls throughout the United States. Macerich currently owns 54 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 48 regional shopping centers. On a comparable company basis, selected benchmark companies include CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (NYSE:CBL), Brixmor Property Group Inc (NYSE:BRX), Kimco Realty Corp (NYSE:KIM) and Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT). Higher growth companies typically trade at higher valuation multiples but this does not appear to be the case for Macerich as shown below. The company's projected 5-year net income CAGR of -28.7% is well below its entire peer group: CBL (-14.3%), BRX (18.1%), KIM (-5.1%) and FRT (4.0%). However, Macerich's P/E multiple of 64.7x is above CBL (10.4x), BRX (16.3x), KIM (19.3x) and FRT (30.6x). The company appears to be expensive on a future cash flow basis as well. Source: finbox.io Shares of Macerich are down -4.4% over the last year and finbox.io's fair value estimate of $37.61 per share calculated from seven cash flow models imply -43.0% downside. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Align Technology Align Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:ALGN) manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners, and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) digital services. The company was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in San Jose, California. The company's valuation multiples currently look expensive relative to peers: Cooper Companies Inc (NYSE:COO), Dentsply Sirona Corp (NASDAQ:XRAY), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) and Cutera Inc (NASDAQ:CUTR). Align Technology's LTM EBITDA multiple of 60.1x is above COO (20.8x), XRAY (22.7x), ABBV (16.6x) and CUTR (54.9x). Cutera's multiple is only slightly below Align Technology's but Wall Street analysts project that the former will grow its cash flows by 62.8% annually over the next five years. This is well above Align Technology's forecasted five-year EBITDA CAGR of 25.2%. Source: finbox.io Align Technology's stock currently trades at $267.10 per share as of Monday January 22, up 190.2% over the last year. However, finbox.io's five valuation analyses suggest that shares are now roughly 35% overvalued. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Intuitive Surgical Indtuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) manufactures and markets da Vinci surgical systems, and related instruments and accessories. The company’s da Vinci surgical System translates a surgeon’s natural hand movements, which are performed on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small incisions or ports. The company also manufactures EndoWrist instruments that include scissors, scalpels, and other surgical tools. It markets its products directly and through distributors in the worldwide. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. Analysts covering the stock often compare Intuitive Surgical to a peer group that includes Edwards Lifesciences Corp (NYSE:EW), Hill-Rom, Inc. (NYSE:HRC), Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:VAR) and Becton, Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX). The company's LTM EBITDA multiple of 39.8x is above all of these comparable public companies: EW (21.7x), HRC (16.4x) and BDX (26.2x). However, notice how the company's projected 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 8.9% is only above HRC (7.7%) and below EW (13.8%), VAR (10.1%) and BDX (20.1%). This implies that the market's valuing Intuitive Surgical at a premium. Source: finbox.io Shares of the company are trading 97.9% higher year over year. But the stock price could end up trading -35.5% lower in 2018 based on Intuitive Surgical's future cash flow projections. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Vulcan Materials Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) produces and sells construction aggregates, asphalt mix, and ready-mixed concrete primarily in the United States. Vulcan Materials was founded in 1909 and is headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. On a comparable company basis, selected benchmark companies include Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM), Summit Materials Inc (NYSE:SUM), Eagle Materials, Inc. (NYSE:EXP) and CRH Plc (ADR) (NYSE:CRH). Analyzing Vulcan Materials' valuation metrics and growth ratios provides further insight into why the stock is expensive. Wall Street analysts project that the company's EBITDA grows at 11.1% over the next five years. This growth rate is only above EXP (10.3%) and below MLM (15.2%), SUM (12.5%) and CRH (12.0%). However, Vulcan Materials' EBITDA multiple trades well above this same peer group implying the stock is quite expensive. Source: finbox.io Vulcan Materials' stock currently trades at $133.00 per share as of Monday January 22, up 4.8% over the last year. On a fundamental basis, the company's stock is trading at a -30.8% premium to finbox.io's intrinsic value estimate. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Mettler-Toledo Mettler-Toledo Internation Inc. (NYSE:MTD) manufactures and supplies precision instruments and services worldwide.

The company's valuation multiples implied by the market currently trade above comparable companies Waters Corporation (NYSE:WAT), PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI), Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). Mettler-Toledo's LTM P/E multiple of 38.2x is above WAT (30.8x), PKI (22.4x), A (34.5x) and TMO (36.9x) while its growth is mediocre at best. Source: finbox.io Shares of the company are up 60.6% over the last year.

Mattel sells its products directly to consumers via its catalog, website, and proprietary retail stores, as well as directly to retailers and distributors. The company was founded in 1945 and is headquartered in El Segundo, California. Sell-side research analysts often compare the company to a peer group that includes Brunswick Corporation (NYSE:BC), Polaris Industries Inc. (NYSE:PII), Acushnet Holdings Corp (NYSE:GOLF) and Hasbro, Inc. (NaASDAQ:HAS). Notice Mattel's projected EBITDA growth of 0% in the chart below. Analysts expect that the company's EBITDA will reach the same level in 2021 as it did in 2016. However, investors purchasing shares today would pay 18.8x EBITDA for a low growth company. This looks very expensive when compared to Mattel's peers. Source: finbox.io Shares of Mattel are down -44.0% over the last year and finbox.io's fair value estimate of $12.25 per share calculated from seven cash flow models imply -23.9% downside. The average price target from 12 Wall Street analysts of $15.50 per share similarly imply downside. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: C.H. Robinson C.H. Robinson Inc (NASDAQ:CHRW) is a third party logistics company providing freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies in various industries worldwide.

On a comparable company basis, selected benchmark companies include XPO Logistics Inc (NYSE:XPO), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) and United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). Analyzing C.H. Robinson Worldwide,'s valuation metrics and growth ratios offers insight into how shares are highly expensive. Typically, high growth companies trade at a higher multiple of EBITDA. But notice the company's projected 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 1.7% is well below all of its peers while its LTM EBITDA multiple of 17.1x is above this same peer group. C.H. Robinson also looks overvalued on a cash flow basis as well. Source: finbox.io C.H. Robinson's stock currently trades at $95.43 per share as of Monday January 22, up 32.4% over the last year. Finbox.io's nine valuation analyses suggest that shares could decrease -23.5% going forward.

The company’s field solutions include various professional test tools, thermal imaging, and calibration equipment for electrical, industrial, electronic, and calibration applications.

(NYSE:AME). Furthermore, the company's EBITDA is only expected to grow at a quicker rate than Pentair over the next five years.

(NYSE:STZ), Coca-Cola European Partners plc (NYSE:CCE) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP). Although Coca-Cola's expected growth is in line with this peer group, the company's P/E multiple of 44.3x is well above DPS (23.8x), STZ.B (23.2x), CCE (22.0x) and PEP (24.8x). Coca-Cola is a quality business but simply looks expensive at current prices. Source: finbox.io Coca-Cola's stock currently trades at $47.38 per share as of Monday January 22, up 18.0% over the last year.

2018-04-26,Equities Futures Higher But Investors Continue Cautious Trading,"The market was revving its engine Monday morning, but a caution flag was still flying, keeping stocks from being off to the races. Momentum from Facebook.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) stronger-than-expected earnings, reported after the market closed yesterday, helped equities futures, which were pointing to a higher open for all three of the main U.S. indices. Investors seemed to cheer as the tech giant beat expectations despite the data handling issue. Eyes will turn to the Seattle area later today as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) report earnings after the bell. Still, sentiment is mixed, with market moves perhaps getting overdone either way because of a tug of war between bulls and bears. Longer term investors may want to simply ignore some of the noise and focus on the fundamentals, which appear strong. Earnings Roundup: Transportation and Food General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) this morning continued the string of companies reporting better-than-expected earnings only to see their stock take a dip. Shares in premarket trading were down about 1 percent. Though GM beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom line, largely on strong sales of crossover vehicles in North America and China, a fall in net income seems to be what led to the underwhelming response. GM's earnings come on the heels of Ford, which reported higher profit yesterday. A similar story was repeated this morning by American Airlines Group Inc. (NYSE:AAL), which posted stronger earnings than analysts were expecting. But its shares slid on a warning about higher fuel prices and other input costs. Also lower this morning were shares of Southwest Airlines (LUV), which reported earnings roughly in line with estimates. The Dallas-based airline, still reeling from a recent mid-air mishap, saw its shares lose over 4 percent in early trading. Moving on to foodstuffs, PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) and Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NASDAQ:CMG) were among those reporting earnings. PEP earnings beat estimates, but its North America beverage division continues to work through some challenges, CEO Indra Nooyi said in this morning's call. CMG, however, seemed to crush it, reporting earnings of $2.13 a share versus analyst estimate of $1.53. CMG shares rose over 14 percent in the pre-market. Investors seem to be realizing the U.S. economy is on decent footing. Helping back that up this morning was news that U.S. jobless claims, which came in under expectations, were at their lowest level since 1969. Yield Watch In news from across the pond, the European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged, but it remains to be seen when the central bank will end its bond-buying program. Futures on the euro (/6E) remain in a tight range just above $1.22. Trading this morning is essentially a carryover from yesterday, when stocks ended mixed as investors seemed to weigh conflicting sentiments. On the one hand, the 10-year Treasury yield closed above 3 percent yesterday, likely reflecting concern about future inflation and causing worry about increased corporate borrowing costs. On the other hand, higher longer term rates can reflect more bullish expectations for economic growth in general. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was back below the 3 percent mark Thursday morning, but concerns about inflation seem to be lingering with crude oil near $70 per barrel and aluminum and steel prices also elevated. Priced for Perfection? Investors also seem to be intently watching earnings. But even though many of the companies that have reported so far have beaten expectations, the market hasn’t seen a large rally. Why, you ask? Well, as been noted before, it appears this market is “priced for perfection”. That generally means if companies knock investors’ socks off, maybe they get a little bump or stay flat. But if there’s anything negative to focus on, that’s where investors’ minds seem to be going. Part of the reason behind that sentiment is that stocks appear to be in a repricing mode. FIGURE 1: 3 percent YIELD AND THE S&P 500. The 10-Year Yield Index (TNX), which reflects 10-times the yield on 10-year US Treasuries, starts the day right at the 3 percent market, a shade lower than yesterday. The S&P 500 Index (SPX - purple line) moved lower yesterday as the 10-year yield moved up, but seemed to settle in by later in the day. Data source: Cboe Global Markets, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Stocks Vs. Bonds The climb in treasury yields to four-year highs could pose a special challenge to stocks that long-term investors often buy and hold for yield. Dividend-paying sectors like telecom, utilities and staples all could face more pressure if yields keep ticking up. Staples are already down double-digits year-to-date. Stocks tend to be riskier than bonds (though no investment is risk free), and if bonds pay decent yields, there may be more pursuit of fixed income. This would tend to pull money into bonds that might have otherwise gone into stocks. Though the 10-year gets most of the headlines, it’s worth noting that the 1-year Treasury note currently yielded 2.247 percent going into Thursday, compared with just a 1.85 percent dividend yield for the S&P 500. More on Yield and Stocks That said, stocks may be able to continue higher even if bond yields also keep rising — at least for a while. After all, there’s nothing really magical about the 3 percent mark. Although it is psychologically important, it really shouldn’t come as a surprise that yields are moving higher, as the Fed has been telegraphing that to the market for a while now. Investors just seem to be in the mood to sell, and that could provide a buying opportunity for contrarian investors. But there is a limit. If the yield on the 10-year Treasury rapidly rises from where it is now to, say, 3.25 percent, then some investors might start rethinking their portfolio mix. Lifeblood of the Economy Trains and trucks are like the blood flowing through the circulatory system of the economy. And the latest checkup results look pretty good. Rail company Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) reported stronger than expected earnings Wednesday. One interesting metric it reported was that overall volumes rose 3 percent as growth in its intermodal category offset declines in merchandise and coal volumes. Trucking companies have also been doing well as demand for their services is high. Trains and trucks transport the building blocks of America’s economy, which means if the companies that operate them are doing well, the economy probably is too.

2018-05-24,"Stifel Rides The Rails, Initiates Seven Stocks","Stifel analyst Michael Baudendistel went all-in on rail stocks Wednesday, reinstating coverage on seven of the biggest names in the railroad industry. Baudendistel is generally bullish on the group, but his analysis suggests some stocks are better bets than others. Here’s a rundown of what he had to say about each name. (See Baudendistel's track record here.) Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU): Buy rating, $130 target. The company’s volume growth has historically allowed the stock to trade at a valuation premium to its peer group, Baudendistel said. “We have long believed KSU to be the Class I rail with the most revenue growth opportunities given its unique positioning in Mexico and at the border, volume growth potential associated with a growing Mexican economy, growth in Mexican manufacturing, the potential for Mexican energy reform and investments made in the Gulf Coast chemicals region. CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX): Buy rating, $73 target. Baudendistel said CXS has has trouble executing its margin expansion plans during its CEO transition. “However, of late, it is clear to us that service levels have improved and 1Q18 results demonstrate that the actions of the last year-and-a-half needed to be done, as the company posted a 570-basis point improvement in operating ratio. Genesee & Wyoming Inc (NYSE:GWR): Buy rating, $90 target. Baudendistel said the company has plenty of growth opportunities both in North America and abroad, but is focusing primarily on North America in the immediate future. “While global market conditions can lead to volume volatility as experienced during the 2015 commodity recession, the company still boasts commodity, customer and geographic diversification that are unparalleled in the railroad industry. Canadian National Railway (USA) (NYSE:CNI): Hold rating, $84 target. Canadian National has had a rough few months, as it lost market share, replaced its CEO, dealt with a harsh winter and cut its guidance in the first quarter. “We believe those challenges are well-known to investors, and going forward, we believe the company knows what needs to be done to get service levels back to where they need to be,” Baudendistel said. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC): Hold rating, $158 target. Norfolk Southern stock is trading at a large valuation discount to its peers, Baudendistel said. “We believe the company has a favorable revenue mix given its relatively high portion of revenue represented by intermodal and chemicals, normally among the fastest growing rail revenue segments, and the company has been outpacing the industry on volume growth.” Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP): Hold rating, $151 target. Union Pacific is one of the safest railroad stock bets for long-term investors, the Stifel analyst said. “The company’s diversified revenue mix, network through the regions with higher population growth, significant further opportunities for margin growth, an outlook for pricing ahead of rail inflation and massive free cash flow, give us a sense that 'only so much can go wrong' with the exceptions of the potential for an economic decline or ramifications from the persistent service issues that have plagued the rail industry of late. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (USA) (NYSE:CP): Hold rating, $201 target. Canadian Pacific now deserves to be considered among the world’s best-run railroads, Baudendistel said. “The past few years, Canadian Pacific Railway has transitioned from arguably the least efficient Class I to arguably the best run railroad as a result of the brief tenure of Hunter Harrison and the implementation of his precision scheduled railroading model, which continues under current CEO Keith Creel.

2018-06-25,"Citi Bullish On Rail Stocks, Upgrades Norfolk Southern","U.S. railroad industry is booming and one Wall Street analyst says it’s full steam ahead for Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC). The Analyst Citi analyst Christian Wetherbee upgraded Norfolk Southern from Neutral to Buy and has raised his price target from $161 to $176. Weatherbee also reiterated ratings on the following five railroad stocks: Canadian National Railway (USA) (NYSE:CNI), Neutral rating, $85 target. Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (USA) (NYSE:CP), Buy rating, $215 target. CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), Buy rating, price target raised from $67 to $75. Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), Buy rating, $123 target. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Buy rating, $170 target. The Thesis Norfolk Southern has a good chance to exceed consensus earnings expectations, and earnings multiples are already expanding in the group. “We acknowledge NS’s service issues, which have kept us on the sidelines previously, but volume and pricing trends have been better than expected and we want to take advantage of the modest pause in shares recently to get more constructive,” Wetherbee said in the note. He said Q2 volumes have been better than expected, and Citi has raised 2018 and 2019 EPS projections for railroad stocks as a group. Following the recent tax reform, Wetherbee said U.S. rail stocks have a chance to produce meaningful free-cash-flow growth. If capex remains elevated over time, Wetherbee said earnings multiples will likely expand accordingly. CSX is Citi’s top stock pick in the space, but rail stocks are a “must-own” sub-sector of the market for the time being. Price Action Norfolk Southern stock traded lower by 2 percent to $20.60.

2018-07-18,Loop Capital Upgrades CSX After Encouraging Q2,"CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) reported second-quarter results Tuesday that prompted Loop Capital Markets to turn bullish on the stock. The Analyst Loop analyst Rick Paterson upgraded CSX from Hold to Buy with a price target lifted from $65 to $78. The Thesis CSX's Q2 print makes it clear the rail line is making progress on the adoption of its scheduled operating model, as seen in an operating ratio improvement from 64.7 percent a year ago to 59.8 percent — excluding real estate gains —in the quarter, Paterson said in the upgrade note. (See the analyst's track record here.) The company appears to be well on track to achieve its full-year operating ratio goal of 60 percent by 2020, the analyst said. CSX continues to widen its lead over regional peer Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) in relative operating efficiency and service, Paterson said. Encouragingly, this is resulting in margin improvements and should translate into future growth and market share gains, he said. An encouraging Q2 report and no signs of standing still prompted the analyst to lift his 2018 earnings per share estimate from $3.23 to $3.58, 2019's estimates from $3.90 to $4.24 and 2020's estimates from $4.30 to $4.61. Price Action CSX shares were rallying 6.52 percent to $68.64 at the time of publication Wednesday.

2018-07-26,"After A Strong Quarter, Norfolk Southern Management Asked: Why Aren't You More Like CSX?","The strong earnings report issued last week by CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) is reverberating through the quarterly release of class 1 railroad earnings, which is now at an end. Last week, CSX reported an operating ratio of 58.6 percent. Wednesday, in its own second quarter earnings report, Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) reported a record quarterly operating ratio of 64.6 percent, improved from 66.9 percent a year earlier. It was the 10th consecutive quarter in which Norfolk Southern recorded an improved operating ratio. That difference with CSX (NASDQ: CSX) was in a quarter in which Norfolk Southern had record income from operations (up 18 percent from 2Q 2017), record net income (up 43 percent from a year earlier) and record earnings per share (up 46 percent from a year ago.). Michael Wheeler, the company's COO, said NS volumes were a near record quarterly total and were a record for the second quarter. Average train length was a record as was crew productivity. We handled 6 percent more volume with just a 1 percent increase in crew, he said. But on the earnings call with analysts, the questions about the OR and its comparison against CSX, (and to a lesser degree, Canadian National, which also came in at less than 60 percent) and what it meant, kept coming steadily. Similar questions were directed at the management of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) whose earnings and less attractive OR were released last week one day after the CSX earnings. One analyst was blunt, asking CEO James Squires why NS can't put up numbers like CSX. Similar questions were answered by Squires with an indirect suggestion that there is a balance between seeking short-term profits at the expenses of long-term service, though Squires would not take the bait and criticize any railroad directly. Questions were also posed to Squires whether NS needed to adopt more of the features of precision railroading, a practice developed primarily by the late CSX CEO Hunter Harrison, who died unexpectedly late last year. Harrison had honed his approach previously at Canadian Pacific and Canadian National. Precision railroading involves several steps, but generally is associated with lesser staffing, fewer hump yards and other operational changes. We are always open to best practices driving for shareholder value, and I am very confident we are on the right track, Squires said. We will pursue a balanced plan and we'll produce great results for our shareholders. A version of that statement was issued by Squires several times during the call NS is adding personnel (though headcount is down year-on-year); CSX is cutting staff. That was the focus of another question to Squires. We are an asset and resource-intensive business, Squires said. We are making sure we have the right level of people. We also have to make the investments in order to grow. We are going to keep people on the staff needed to generate the growth. Another analyst asked whether there was a case to restructure a little quicker, to take the service hit but be generating the same growth rate at a much better OR. Squires said there are operational changes being made at NS. For example, the centralization of dispatchers, which has occurred at other railroads but not NS so far, is being undertaken at Norfolk, Squires said, with all dispatchers to be centralized in Atlanta. And while the company reopened a hump yard in Chattanooga, it has closed hump yards in recent years, he said. But in an industry whose service levels began plummeting about a year ago, Squires said the customer needs to be the primary area of attention. We are very focused on getting customer service back to where it needs to be, he said. Adding head count now is part of that, Squires added. Despite the questioning of the Norfolk Southern management, investors appeared to focus more on the strong earnings report. At approximately 12:30 p.m., Norfolk Southern stock was up about 1 percent to $162.15, though most transportation stocks recovered after Wednesday's severe selloff even as broader market indices were mostly lower. Norfolk Southern does not give pricing guidance, and does not disclose the rate of agreed-upon price increases. But Alan Shaw, the company's chief marketing officer, said there had been a strong performance by the Norfolk Southern intermodal division, driven in part by the truck market. We felt like the tight truck market would lead to an improvement in pricing well into 2019, and that is what we are seeing now, Shaw said. The NS intermodal division had a 20 percent increase in revenue, an 8 percent increase in volume (both to record levels) and a 6 percent increase in revenue per unit adjusted for fuel. Michael Wheeler, the Norfolk Southern COO, said intermodal pricing remains strong, but it did flatten out relative to the first quarter. Shaw said Norfolk Southern's intermodal franchise is the best in the east. We've made investments in this over time, and that is bearing fruit for us, and that is why we are able to deliver 20 percent growth in each quarter this year. The company is in a position to leverage the tight truck market into 20 percent growth. Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe"

2018-08-09,BNSF's Second Quarter Operating Revenue Comes In Weakest Of The Class 1 Railroads,"BNSF saw a slight improvement in its operating ratio between the first and second quarter this year, but it was higher than that of 2017 and in a range that drew criticism for other companies. BNSF is part of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B), so it does not have traditional standalone quarterly earnings per se. But a statement on the company's financial performance is released each quarter following the release of Berkshire Hathaway earnings. For the second quarter of this year, the operating ratio posted by BNSF was 66.8 percent. That was worse than the 65.3 percent of the second quarter of 2017, but was an improvement over the 67.9 percent posted in the first quarter of this year. Virtually every railroad posted an improved OR between the first and second quarters of this year, as the tough weather of winter 2018 faded away to the milder conditoins of spring and early summer. The BNSF statement does not discuss management's views of the OR. But an OR of 63 percent posted by Union Pacific (NYSE:UP) brought a decidedly negative reaction when posted a few weeks ago, particularly in comparison to those of CSX and Canadian National, which were both sub-60 percent. Other class 1 railroads--Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP)--were all around 64 percent, and Canadian Pacific's number was negatively impacted by labor disruptions that resulted in just a small strike but the disruption created by two shutdowns. The OR for BNSF was recorded on just a 6 percent increase in operating income, on a jump in total revenues of 12 percent and a 15 percent increase in operating expenses compared to the second quarter of 2017. Net income rose 37 percent. That sharply higher rate of growth in net income is probably attributable to a significantly lower income tax rate for BNSF. In its 10-Q report with the SEC, Berkshire Hathaway said BNSF's effective income tax rate for the quarter was 20.9 percent, compared to 37.7 percent a year ago. Among other data reported by BNSF: Higher intermodal volumes were reported as a key driver in a 5 percent increase for the Consumer Procucts segment in the second quarter and the first half of 2018. The increases were driven by economic growth and tight truck capacity leading to conversion from highway to rail, as well as strength in imports and containerized agricultural product exports, the BNSF report said. Industrial product volumes were up 10 percent for the quarter compared to 2017, with the railroad citing strength for sand, petroleum products, steel and plastics. Agricultural products were up 9 percent for the quarter and 8 percent for the year. Coal was flat for the quarter and down 1percent for the first half of the year. Compensation and benefits expenses were up 6 percent for the quarter and 4percent for the half, primarily due to wage inflation, increased volumes and higher training costs. Trucking companies aren't the only ones reporting higher purchased transport costs. That category for BNSF was up 17 percent in the second quarter and 14 percent for the half, with various trucking services cited as the reason. The higher numbers were as a result of higher purchased transportation costs of our logistics services business, which are offset in other revenues, as well as increased intermodal ramping, drayage, and other volume-related activities.

2018-08-09,CSX's intermodal Efficiency Drive Cuts Some Union Pacific Services,"Up to two-thirds of intermodal service between CSX and UP face disruption. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) customers sending freight east of the Mississippi have fewer options as the west's main rail line blames changes on the part of its eastern peer CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX). In a customer notice sent last week, the line cut 197 of 301 origin-destination pairs provided through network interconnects between the two. Among the metro destinations affected are Baltimore, Charleston, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Portsmouth, Savannah, Nashville and Columbus. See new route options for UP-CSX intermodal service The service changes stem directly from what UP calls interline intermodal service changes on the part of CSX. UP customers will have to find route options by 17 September due to the complexity of the CSX's intermodal service changes. Requests for comment from CSX and UP were not returned by publication time. On the company's second quarter conference call, CSX chief executive James Foote said that domestic intermodal revenue was relatively flat on a year-over-year basis because of the line rationalizations that we went through in the fall of 2017. Although intermodal amounts to 44 percent of volume carried on the CSX network, 2017 revenue per unit is the lowest of CSX's segments at $633, up just 3 percent from 2016. He says the company plans to further revamp the unit in the coming months. Our intermodal network needs a ton of work in order to become the efficient part of our system that it needs to be and we're just really beginning to get in there and start to figure out how to rationalize that big part of our business, so we can become much more efficient and have a much better product for our customers, Foote said on the conference call. For its part, UP said its domestic intermodal business saw a 7 percent increase in the second quarter, thanks to tight truckload capacity. Beth Whited, chief marketing officer of UP, said the company is courting beneficial cargo owners to make sure that we're able to express the value that Union Pacific can provide. The service changes mean most eastbound UP cars will wind up in the Chicago area. UP will also continue to offer intermodal service with Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) to several of the regions affected. Deutsche Bank equity researchers say CSX delivers to over 30 destinations from the interchange with UP at Chicago. But the destinations affected by the move may not represent too much in terms of freight volume as they are very low density. From CSX's perspective the move makes sense. Despite . . . bluster from shippers with respect to impending service disruptions, we believe actual implications are minimal, while being highly favorable for the efficiency of CSX's intermodal network, Deutsche Bank said. The bank estimates up to one-third of the lanes being closed have no traffic at all, with the most dense lane having relatively small amounts of container traffic per day. Deutsche Bank estimates the revenue associated with the 197 lanes accounts for less than 1 percent of CSX's revenue, which implies an even smaller amount for Union Pacific. Moreover, there can be incremental efficiencies to the carriers intermodal networks with traffic destined for Tennessee, Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas now interchanging through Memphis versus Chicago prior, which we estimate reduces distance traveled by about 700 miles. But shippers will feel a direct impact due to the changes. Brian Bowers, an intermodal veteran with experience at Hub Group and Schneider International, says the changes will hit a variety of retail shipments at an inopportune time. The timing of this move is horrendous in the middle of the fall surge and in the middle of all types of capacity issues, he said. Bowers, who currently serves on the board of advisers to Freightwaves, says shippers could be forced to take containers off at Chicago and re-ramp them to another yard, forcing more containers onto city streets and tying up dray trucking. CSX makes a wide ranging decision that will eliminate service to a lot of markets or complicate service to certain markets, he added. For example, UP shipments to Baltimore will now have to shift onto the Norfolk Southern line at Harrisburg or to CSX in Chambersburg, both of which destinations will require draying or surface trucking to bring containers to their final destination. All the intermodal pricing that has been quoted to Walmart on down to Joe's grocery is based on delivery to Baltimore, not Chambersburg, Bowers. Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe"

2018-09-06,"At An Investors' Conference, Norfolk Southern Is Still Getting Asked About Its Comparison To CSX","Even at an investors' conference sponsored by Cowen Inc. in Boston, Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) couldn't get away from CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX). Appearing before investors about 3 1/2 hours after CSX CFO Frank Lonegro on Tuesday kicked off one stream of presentations at the Cowen meeting, her counterpart at Norfolk Southern, Cindy Earhart, faced questions about why its operating ratio in the second quarter was significantly worse than that of northeast competitor CSX. For the quarter, NS posted an OR of 64.6 percent, a record for the second quarter in which is also posted several other record-breaking figures. But CSX' was 58.6 percent, and back when the numbers were announced, and in the Norfolk Southern earnings call, there was implicit criticism on the part of several analysts as to why NS didn't do as well as CSX. The two railroads have significant overlap in their systems in the eastern part of the country. Jason Seidl, the host of the conference and Cowen's lead transportation analyst, said in a fireside chat with Earhart that he believed it was an unfair comparison, given your record results. Still, he asked Earhart to compare the two companies and possible find explanations for the difference in ORs. Are there major differences that could prevent Norfolk Southern from getting to CSX' levels now, or are these just two railroads taking different paths to get to the same place? Seidl asked. Earhart said NS continues to have a lot of confidence in delivering on its financial targets. But she indicated that the concerns raised by analysts have been heard, and the company's third quarter earnings call would likely have focus on what NS will do to improve its productivity; she did not mention CSX by name. You'll hear more when we talk about our plans, she said. We're looking at every area of the company, Earhart said. We are highly focused, and we understand margin improvements need to be a big part of that. We recognize that there are going to continue to be opportunities for us to push productivity. An unidentified questioner on the webcast of the presentation--FreightWaves listened to the discussion via webcast--was more pointed in his questioning. He noted that NS consistently had superior ORs to CSX, and he referred to thinly-veiled suggestions made by NS management on occasion that an excessive focus on OR could damage growth opportunities. Why is it that more growth means it has to be a little worse OR? he said. I don't get that. Earhart again reiterated that an effort to improve productivity will be a focus of NS going forward. But she also said we want to be able to grow with our customers, and suggested that some slack in a system can enable rail companies to grab those opportunities. Earhart focused on improvements in various metrics, with dwell time and average network speed as key benchmarks. But taking a snap shot of the weekly data provide by the Surface Transportation Board does not indicate things are improving substantially. For example, a year ago, average system dwell time was 24.5 hours, according to STB, while in its most recent report, STB said system dwell time was 26.1 hours. The average speed in the system was down to 19.6 from 21.5. Dwell time is down from the end of March but system speed is not. Lonegro, in representing CSX, talked about a company that continues to implement precision railroading. It's a difficult concept to summarize easily, but it generally involves moving away from a hub and spoke system, moving more toward poit-to-point shipments, and in the process paring back service. He said those changes have resulted in some metrics that would appear to be reducing capacity, such as additional storing of locomotives. But he said of the upcoming peak season, We're ready to handle those volumes in a precision railroad way. Part of that focus will be CSX' intermodal division. According to Lonegro, the intermodal sector at CSX accounts for about 40 percent of its volumes but only 20 percent of its revenue. How do improve profitability and reliability? he said. We want it to be more truck-like. As part of that, CSX is engaged in some changes in its intermodal division, which include more direct routing and less hub and spoke; increasing train lengths; and trying to stay away from Chicago and do interchanges elsewhere. He said those changes have resulted in some metrics that would appear to be reducing capacity, such as additional storing of locomotives. But he said of the upcoming peak season, We're ready to handle those volumes in a precision railroad way. We're looking for the opportunity to take out miles, Lonegro said. Execution is the key. It also may involve closing some intermodal terminals. Lonegro said CSX is having candid conversations with our customers, letting them know that eventually, if we can't serve a destination or origin effectively, then we probably shouldn't serve that terminal at all. He added that no changes in terminal operations were going to be implemented during the upcoming peak shipping season. In the same way that NS gets questioned about its OR, CSX has faced questions about whether its focus on rationalization of assets might limit opportunities in growing markets. Lonegro cited the recent re-opening of the Nashville hump yard as an example of CSX' willingness to add service where it is necessary. If it turns out there is significant growth in a particular area, we would look at another hump, he said. But Lonegro also said that CSX has probably taken out about 20 percent of its network through precision railroading, but still spent a billion dollars in other investment. As a result, as far as capacity, we're in a good spot, he said. Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe"
2018-09-12,"Railroads Have Spent A Lot Of Money The Last 10 Years, And Customers Have Barely Benefited: FTR Speaker","After spending plenty of money on investment in the last 10-plus years, the nation's class 1 railroads are basically standing still. That was the sobering view presented by John Schmitter, a former railroad executive who now heads his own consultancy, KEP LLC. Addressing the 2018 FTR Transportation Conference in Indiana, his subject's title--How Technology will Change Rail Economics--reviewed how technology has made those changes, and yet has provided little shift in overall network velocity and essentially no increase in capacity since 2005. All of that came to a head last year, Schmitter noted, with the rapid deterioration of rail service, a downward shift severe enough to have the Surface Transportation Board put the class 1 railroads under review. With the failure to invest in more capacity, Schmitter said, there's not much system resiliency or flexibility on most railroads. Rapid unexpected volume increases have and will result in congestion and service deterioration that can last months. And that's what happened in 2017, running into 2018. If there's a culprit in all this, Schmitter said, it's the investment community. If the railroads invested in too much capacity, Wall Street would kill them, Schmitter said. The lack of resiliency in the system, Schmitter said, is a management a decision. A few railroads invested more than half their operating cash flow back into the systems, according to Schmitter, but if it gets out of line and Wall Street finds they overinvested in capacity, they'll find some new management. And when spending is undertaken to make needed fixes, it's too late. The investments that are being made now are being done to handle the volume that showed up in 2017, he said. Citing the weather for the 2017-2018 is misplaced, Schmitter said. The reason was rapid unexpected increases in volumes, because the system by design is capacity constrained. Schmitter asked the meeting's attendees in the room how many of them were rail customers, and how many had suffered disruptions during the recent disturbance. Of the hands that went up the first time, most of them stayed up when the second question was asked. But when Schmitter asked how many had changed carriers or moved that business over to trucks, virtually all hands went down. So there's no penalty, Schmitter said. Schmitter noted that the class 1 railroad competitive market basically boiled down to--though he did not mention the companies by name--BNSF vs. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) in the West, CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) vs. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) in the east, with Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) and Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) in Canada with their systems extending into the U.S. (NYSE:KSC), but they view themselves as the NAFTA railroad into Mexico.) With that minimal level of rail competition, most locations have only one option on the rails, with a duopoly at best. Asked if that situation inspires companies to innovate, Schmitter said he questioned that it's any one's goal to be better than the other guy. It's not really a competitive marketplace like you would experience in trucking. The lack of capacity is stopping railroads from aggressively grabbing freight from a driver- and capacity-squeezed trucking market. They haven't been able to take advantage of all the problems with trucking, and technology is not going to make it happen, Schmitter said. This is a management issue, a strategic issue and a cultural issue. The goal, he said, needs to change company operations to ensure that the shipments will be there when they are promised. The reduction in capacity combined with the rise in demand for that capacity means that on multiple occasions in recent years, traffic on the rails has approached capacity. Capacity on class 1 railroads is now closely matched to projected volume, Schmitter said. Echoing what he heard a rail CEO say about the capacity crunch, Schmitter exclaimed: It's five minutes to midnight. The lack of significant progress since 2005 is in stark contrast to the gains made between 1980 and that year. The start of that stretch, in 1980, is significant because it marks the year of the Staggers Act, which deregulated the U.S. rail industry. Not all of the gains in efficiency were because of technology, Schmitter said; some of it was just simply the abandonment of unnecessary capacity. But during that 25-year stretch, the productivity of employees and the network rose significantly, with volume up 84 percent while capacity has had no significant increase. The average freight per train is up 63 percent, according to Schmitter. But now, Schmitter was mostly pessimistic: I think things will get more efficient and safer, and there will be a good impact on the (operating ratio). But I don't see technology providing more capacity or to do much more for service. Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe"
2018-09-13,Coal Exports Face Delays As U.S. East Coast Rail Service Slows For Florence,"Hurricane Florence will interrupt the main rail and maritime conduits for U.S. coal exports, according to Susquehanna Financial Group. Susquehanna's rail analyst Bascome Majors says CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) are most exposed to any service interruptions caused by Florence with the most notable immediate risk being East Coast coal export infrastructure in Virginia (Hampton Roads) and Baltimore. Although indeterminate as yet, the length of any Florence-related outages for Norfolk Southern and CSX could affect results, given the profitable bottom-line contribution from that volatile commodity in 2018, Majors said. Norfolk Southern operates the Lamberts Point transloading facility at the Port of Virginia, which can process up to 48 million tons annually and load the largest bulk ships with coal. CSX services the Dominion Coal Terminal in the Port. The Port of Virginia saw coal volume of 11.6 million tons in the second quarter, a 36 percent gain from the same time last year. The Port of Virginia is closed to ship traffic due to Hurricane Florence. Norfolk Southern says it will issue embargoes to coal shippers affected by Florence. Any railcars enroute to the Port will be held at yards. To the north, CSX operates the Curtis Bay Coal Piers in Baltimore. CSX and Norfolk Southern also service the Tradepoint Atlantic transshipment facility at the Port. The Port of Baltimore remains open to vessel traffic, but the U.S. Coast Guard is warning ships of gale force winds approaching the region. While the actual impact and damage of Florence have yet to be felt, Majors says the storm could be a catalyst for transportation pricing due to the delays and restart of facilities following the storm. Once Florence passes, the disruption and subsequent rebuild/response could more materially tighten trucking capacity and spot pricing ahead of the peak season, supporting both volume and pricing on the rails given 2017's impact from Harvey around Houston fresh in shippers, carriers, and brokers' minds.

2018-09-17,North Carolina Ports See Florence Damage And Will Remain Closed Until Mid-Week,"Hurricane Florence's destructive path will leave North Carolina's main ports offline until mid-week. The North Carolina Ports Authority says the initial assessments at the Port of Wilmington and the Port of Morehead City indicate there is damage at both locations to warehouse and other structures, as well as a significant number of downed empty containers to be cleared. It say the ports will remain closed until Wednesday September 19 before deciding when they will open. The Port of Wilmington is North Carolina's main container ship port, while Port of Morehead City handles most oversized and bulk cargoes. Wilmington is one of the smaller ports in the path of Florence, with an average vessel size of 4,758 twenty foot equivalent unit (teu) making call on the port, compared to an average vessel size of 7,575 teu calling on Port of Charleston just to the South. The South Carolina Ports Authority says the Charleston container terminal has resumed vessel operations with container gates opening tomorrow morning. Intermodal rail service through Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) will also resume tomorrow. Complete Hurricane Florence Coverage Want more content like this?

2018-09-18,"Loop Switches To Bullish Stance On Union Pacific, Cites Railroad's New Operating Plan","Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) stock rallied Tuesday after the company announced it will enact a new operating plan Oct. 1. One Wall Street analyst sees the move as reason enough to buy the stock. The Analyst Loop Capital Markets analyst Rick Paterson has upgraded Union Pacific from Hold to Buy and raised the price target from $153 to $188. The Thesis The shift to precision scheduled railroading principles is the right move for Union Pacific, Paterson said in the Tuesday upgrade note. PSR is a method of increasing railroad efficiency by focusing more on moving cars than trains, increasing use of general-purpose trains and optimizing crews and rail asset utilization, the analyst said. It's been a while since Union Pacific was at the top of its game, but the PSR principles will better position the company and the stock in the long run, Paterson said. Loop is now projecting a 2020 Union Pacific operating ratio of 60 percent, up from a previous estimate of 58.9 percent. In the meantime, Union Pacific investors should be prepared for some short-term disruptions while the changes are made, he said. “UP will be the first Class I to attempt a conversion to PSR without the effort being led by the late Hunter Harrison, and it's going to be interesting to see if the team at UP is up to the task,” the analyst said. Not only is Paterson confident in Union Pacific’s plan, he said the shift to a PSR-centric model puts intense pressure on Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) to do the same. Price Action After Tuesday morning’s gain, Union Pacific stock is now up 22.3 percent year-to-date.

2018-09-19,Freight Alley: A Region Where Logistics Contributes To More Than 40% Of The Economy,"Freight Alley is an area that roughly defines freight traffic moving throughout the southeastern US, particularly in Tennessee, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. For years, the region has been a manufacturing powerhouse and in no-small coincidence a major distribution and logistics region. We have named this region Freight Alley because of the importance logistics and transportation plays in the region and how important the region is to the North American logistics map. In many ways the area is similar to Canada in both population and economics. According to the latest census data, 37 million people calls this area home (the Canadian population is 36.29 million). Also, interesting enough, the GRP (Gross Regional Product) of Freight Alley is $1.75 trillion, slightly higher than the GDP of Canada at $1.53 trillion. But that is where the similarities really end: Canadians have their hockey and Tim Hortons and Freight Alley has NASCAR and Krystal (not to mention college football). The region is also home to world's busiest airport (Atlanta Hartsfield), the second busiest cargo airport in the world (Memphis), and home to two of the largest transportation companies, globally : FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) and United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). It also plays host to one of the largest truck manufacturers: Freightliner and it's production facility just outside of Charlotte. Two global tire manufacturers have their North American headquarters in the region: Bridgestone and Michelin. Great Dane Trailers, one the top three manufacturers of trailers is located at the southern end of the region, in Savannah, GA. The region is also littered with freight brokerages and trucking companies that provide an outsized portion of the transportation services in North America. While the area only has 11.28 percent of the U.S. population, it receives 14 percent of the freight. Also, freight plays an even bigger role than the economic makeup of the region compared to most of North America, being the origin point for 17.03 percent of all U.S. freight, but only 8.7 percent of GDP. Atlanta is also the number one freight market in the country, measured by SONAR data. Of the region's 37 million residents, 1.25 million people work in transportation and 230,000 are heavy-duty truck drivers. Freight Alley employs 12.52 percent of the country's truck driving population. Also interesting is that the region is one of the most important producers of automobiles in the U.S., producing 18.3 percent of the cars in the US, nearly twice the amount of cars that Detroit produces. Freight alley Universities have been ramping up their supply-chain programs across the U.S., hoping to take advantage of a broader trend in companies investing in supply-chain departments and resources, but three of the Universities in the area still have a major focus on logistics and transportation (Auburn, Georgia Tech, and UT). A 2013 study conducted by Thrive Regional Partnership found that 42 percent of the region's employment and 40 percent of its economic output ($6.6 billion) was related to logistics-dependent companies involved in manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, construction, mining, agriculture, retail/wholesale trade, and utilities. This compares to just 29 percent for the entire U.S. At The Heart Of It All The area is ideally situated to move freight, and that has been a big reason for its popularity. Chattanooga a city that sits directly in the center of Freight Alley has both benefited and contributed to the concentration of logistics services in the region. According to a freight study by Cambridge Systematics, Chattanooga ranks No. 1 of all metropolitan cities when it comes to freight movement. The Thrive 2055 study, commissioned by the Chattanooga-Hamilton County Transportation Planning Organization, found that approximately 80 percent of all the nation's freight travels through Chattanooga on its way to its final destination. This is due in large part to the convergence of three Interstates: I-75, I-24, and I-59. The report predicted that the dependence on these businesses would grow in the future. With 80 percent of the U.S. population within a two-day truck transit time from Chattanooga, it's no question that Gig City is the heart of Freight Alley. Total freight volume (by weight) in Chattanooga will grow from about 25 million tons in 2007 to 33 million tons in 2035, despite the recent recession, the report notes. Most of this freight will be inbound or outbound, reflecting Chattanooga's position as a regional distribution center, manufacturing base, and freight hub. On a per-capita basis, Chattanooga has more truckload brokerages ($10M+) than any other city in the United States. The great thing about freight brokerages is that jobs in that industry provide a lot of upward mobility, something that a small city desperately needs in a gig economy. Few jobs offer someone without a college education to make six figures. Freight brokerage does, however. All someone needs is a computer, brokerage software, access to a load board, and a keen sense of negotiation, and they are off to the races. Having access to a talent pool and guidance of other brokers in the area helps them scale. Freight Alley is home to well more than fifty $20M+ asset-based truckload carriers, including U.S. Xpress, Inc. (NYSE:USX), Covenant Transportation Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVTI), Western Express, P&S Transportation,Boyd Bros. ((Daseke, NASDAQ:DSKE)) and CRST Malone. Coyote also has a significant presence in Chattanooga by way of the acquisition of Access America in 2014. Lipsey Logistics, originally funded by a water company executive out of Atlanta, established its logistics home in Chattanooga primarily because of the talent-base that is found in Chattanooga. Lipsey is widely regarded as the leading FEMA broker in the U.S., providing natural disaster logistics for federal and state governments. When we launched FreightWaves in Chattanooga, our intention was to establish Chattanooga as a global hub for freight market data, leveraging the Gig City's high-speed Internet and deeply seeded logistics industry network. It's all about Tribal Knowledge and Data. — Craig Fuller, CEO, FreightWaves AmeriCold Logistics, Kenco Logistics, Averitt Express, Geodis, Saia Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA), Forward Air Corporation (NASDAQ:FWRD), and LandAir also call Freight Alley home. Ingram Barge, the largest barge company in the U.S., is also located in Nashville. The US headquarters of Michelin (ADR) (OTCMKTS: MGDDY) are squarely located in Freight Alley, having moved to Greenville, SC in 1988. Bridgestone Corp. (ADR) (OTCMKTS: BRDCY) also calls Freight Alley home: its US headquarters have been in Nashville, Tennessee since 1992. With FedEX based in Memphis and UPS in Atlanta. The nearby University of Tennessee-Knoxville ranks as the No. 3 university in the nation for logistics. Georgia Tech also has one of the most respected supply-chain programs in the country, ranking at No. 5 in the US and is widely respected as one of the top data-mining and business intelligence universities in the world using applied scientific principles in its supply-chain research and education. The appeal of Freight Alley Industries that are highly innovative tend to cluster. Talent is a huge issue for rapidly changing business models and you need to tap into the talent base of experienced employees, vendors, and strategists that are connected and have a deep understanding of how things work in that sector. If you are setting up a highly-innovative market data business based on freight, knowledge and real-time market insights are critical to scale. Chattanooga and the broader region is incredibly seeded with talent that understands the logistics industry with many leading firms having a significant presence here. Our freight market data business is able to take advantage of these connections to the freight market to expand our tribal knowledge, expand our data sources, and design products that will be needed and demanded by the market. Real-time information is critical to an industry seeing rapid digitization and innovation. No city in the U.S. is better positioned to understand the direction and economics of freight than Chattanooga, Fuller says. Booming Birmingham What Chattanooga is doing with its technology push to land logistics and transportation startups, Birmingham has been able to do with its steel knowledge. That city is known for its expertise in the more specialized flatbed industry with a collection of flatbed carriers setting up shop, including Buddy Moore Trucking, Montgomery Transport, Blair Logistics. Three of the top ten flatbed carriers are based or have business units based in Birmingham including Daeske, CRST Malone, and P&S Transportation. Flatbed became popular in Birmingham during the steel boom [because] iron ore is rich in Birmingham, Mauricio Paredes, director of information technology at P&S, tells FreightWaves. He adds that Birmingham steel did not play a major role in automakers' just-in-time delivery processes and that allowed the city's steelworkers to avoid the most damaging effects of the automotive industry collapse. Birmingham offers diverse choices in steel which also helped it weather the crisis. P&S is one of the largest flatbed operators with over 2,000 trucks. This separated Birmingham from the rust-belt and made it a prime location for larger flatbed carriers to create their headquarters, Paredes notes. Like Chattanooga's easy Interstate access, Birmingham flatbed fleets also have quick access to Interstates that can allow carriers to easily route trucks to Chicago, Dallas, Houston and up and down the East Coast. Growth Of The Port Of Savannah No story about the freight market in the South would be complete without mentioning the growth of the Port of Savannah over the past two decades. It has only been about twenty years ago when the Port of Savannah added an intermodal facility to load cargo onto rail lines out of the port. Today, the port is serviced by CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) and is the fourth-largest port in North America. It is also the fastest growing one. With the expansion of the Panama Canal, it is expected to grow at an even faster rate. On September 17, 2018, Georgia Ports Authority approved $92 million in funding for more intermodal rail capacity. In July 2015, the State of Georgia, Georgia Ports Authority, Murray County, and CSX signed a memorandum to build an-inland intermodal port in Northwest Georgia. Three years later, the Appalachian Regional Port opened and will handle over 50,000 containers per year. It is expected to double within the next decade. The inland port is 45 miles from Chattanooga and 96 miles from Atlanta. Other Regional Participants P&S has taken advantage of the local talent as well, with many of its dispatch team graduating from nearby Auburn University or the University of Tennessee. Companies that service the industry also have a significant presence in the area. One of the leading trade publications, Randall-Reilly Publishing is located in Tuscaloosa. Chainalytics, a leading Supply-chain consulting firm is based in Atlanta, as is Manhattan and Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH) a major supply-chain technology vendor. McLeod Computing, one of the top software vendors to the freight industry is located in Birmingham. SMC3, the leading LTL pricing and rating service, has its HQ in Atlanta. Pilot Flying J, the largest truckstop and diesel fuel vendor to the trucking industry is located in Knoxville. Idle Air, the leading provider of in-cab climate control and entertainment also calls Knoxville home. Comdata/Fleetcor Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:FLT), the largest fleet card provider in the business have HQs in both Nashville and Atlanta. U.S. Bank's fleet-card business even gained a small foothold into the city, by way of its investment and acquisition of Chattanooga's own TransCard fleet processing unit in 2012. So, this coming holiday rush when tracking your package online, chances are that the shipment has traveled through the region between Savannah, Memphis, Knoxville, and Charlotte known as Freight Alley.

2018-09-19,NAFTA Talks Race Against Mexico's Deadline,"Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland was in Washington, D.C. Wednesday to continue talks on a trade deal between the U.S. and Canada. The sticking point of the talks relates to Canada’s “Class 7” milk pricing system, but Canada is motivated to get a deal done, according to Height Securities analyst Clayton Allen. Sticking Point Mexico has said Sept. 20 is the deadline for completing a deal in time to release the text of the agreement 10 days later. That may not leave enough time for Canada to reach an agreement, Allen said in a Wednesday note. “However, we expect that Republicans in Congress may give President Trump some flexibility in the TPA process, opening a possibility for more time to work with Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is fighting hard for the Candian dairy industry, in part because of upcoming Oct. 1 elections in Canada’s largest dairy-producing province, Allen said. Two Paths Forward If a deal is not completed by Sept. 20, two possibilities exist, Allen said. First, Congressional Republicans could agree to the terms of a deal without having the text fully finalized, the analyst said. In addition, the U.S. and Mexico could released the unfinished text of the deal Sept. 30 and go back and retroactively amend the details, he said. “Both of these scenarios — either a non-final deal text or an amendment of the text after Sept. 30th to include Canada — require that Republicans are willing to differentiate between the requirement for the president to submit text 60 days prior to signing and the requirement for the U.S. to agree to final text (what would be signed by Dec. 1) prior to moving forward with Congressional approval. Congressional Republicans would likely be flexible out of a desire to see a new agreement in place heading into 2019, according to Height. Market Impact In the meantime, stocks that benefit from North American trade, including General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and others could struggle to gain ground.

2018-10-10,CSX Sues Norfolk Southern; Says Access To A Small Key Hampton Roads Railroad is Being Blocked,"A long-simmering dispute between CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) and its rival Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) has landed in court, with CSX claiming that Norfolk Southern's control of a small railroad within the port of Hampton Roads is all but blocking CSX from launching any intermodal service from there. According to the case filed last week kin U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, the focus of the suit is the Norfolk & Portsmouth Belt Line Railroad (NPBL). The suit says the railroad operates approximately 26 miles. Don't miss MarketWaves 18. Register today It is jointly owned by CSX and Norfolk Southern and was described in the suit as a terminal switching railroad. According to the lawsuit, it was created in 1896 to be shared by many railroads, and ownership was distributed among many railroads, with none having a controlling interest. But with mergers and consolidation, there are now two owners: Norfolk Southern and CSX. The latter has 43 percent; the former has the rest. And with that control, according to the lawsuit--which also names several Norfolk Southern executives who are also directors of NPBL--there has been a conspiracy to operate the NPBL in order to benefit NS at the expense of the profitability and viability of the NPBL, and to harm NS's competitor CSXT. The battleground is over the Norfolk International Terminals. According to the suit, the only two railroads that have access to NIT are Norfolk Southern and the NPBL. NPBL uses Norfolk Southern tracks to get into the NIT, and the two of them have used the NPBL as a chess piece to establish and maintain NS's monopolistic control over intermodal transportation in and out of NIT by making it practically impossible for any other rail carriers to provide intermodal service to NIT, the suit alleges. One of the tools for restricting access has been to starve NPBL of investment, the suit says, with sales of important assets and a rate card that is designed to exclude competition in the relevant market. As a result, while more traffic has been coming through NIT, NPBL's revenues have tellingly remained flat or decreased. In the suit, CSX does not say whether it is completely shut out of intermodal opportunities. At one point, the suit says CSX is practically precluded from using the NPBL to connect to NIT because the rate set by NPBL's board, in concert with NS, is prohibitively expense and because NS refuses to allow NPBL to handle intermodal trains over its tracks on a regular basis. It did say that the only modern example of CSX use of the system was in 2015 when NIT was overwhelmed with containers. No new sources of substantial and recurring business have been added in recent years nor do any appear to be planned, according to the suit. In the suit, CSX said it had recommended to the NPBL board a plan for increasing capacity and allowing it more access, but the recommendations were summarily quashed. NS in conspiracy with the NPBL have operated the NPBL as a vehicle for advancing NS's interests at the expense of their contractual duties to CSXT, the suit says. The suit alleges several violations of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and violations of the fiduciary duties of Norfolk Southern and the individual directors of NPBL. The suit seeks damages but also asks for an injunction against the defendants that restores CSXT's right as a co-equal shareholder and/or establishes an independent board structure as previously proposed by CSXT. A Norfolk Southern spokesman declined comment on the suit. Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe"
2018-10-15,Susquehanna: Railroads Must Grow Volumes And FCF To Maintain Rich Valuations,"This week, Class 1 railroads will begin reporting their third quarter earnings, beginning with CSX Corporation's (NASDAQ:CSX) call on Tuesday, October 16, after markets close. Ahead of those calls, Susquehanna Financial Group's transport equities analyst Bascome Majors published an optimistic Q3 preview note anticipating beats across the industry. A wave of cost-cutting has swept across the railroad sector, inspired by Hunter Harrison's spectacular results at Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI), Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP), and CSX. Operating ratios have been driven down in every railroad, including Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), which has resisted Precision Scheduled Railroading but still managed to lower its OR from 69.9 percent in 2012 to an estimated 64.4 percent by the end of this year. With that has come deteriorating service metrics, including train velocity and dwell time, for most railroads except CSX. KSU, in particular, has had trouble managing cross-border traffic at Laredo, and dwell times are up 20.6 percent year over year. In Susquehanna's view, railroads are approaching the limit to what can be accomplished through ‘Harrison-light' operating principles, and further growth in the value of railroads' stock will be on the back on increased volumes and improved free cash flow (due to tax cuts and the winding down of the Positive Train Control investment cycle). Looking beyond the quarter (and this week's steep selloff in rails), we're starting to see some parallels to the peak rail environment of 4Q14 where rail stocks reached a multi-year apex in price and valuation, though we don't yet view today's backdrop as extreme as late 2014's, Majors wrote. Against this backdrop, we believe the rails need to continue to deliver solid volume and productivity growth to ‘work' into 2019. The trouble is that the drive toward greater operating efficiencies has made railroad companies' stock far more valuable, in terms of P/E ratio, than they have traded at historically. Majors wrote that one downside risk is that the end of 2018 resembles in some ways ‘peak rail' in the fourth quarter of 2014, after which U.S. rail stocks entered a long slide, reaching the bottom of the trough in early 2016 at multiples of 12.5-14.5x. By contrast, Majors set aggressive new price targets for CSX, Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) at multiples of 18x, 19.5x, and 19.5x, respectively. Majors set CSX's price target at $84, representing a 19.6 percent upside from where the stock closed last Friday, NSC at a price target of $203, representing a 19.27 percent upside from its previous close, and UNP at $179, representing a 17.26 percent upside from its close last Friday. On Norfolk Southern, Majors wrote, We believe this elevated P/E multiple is cyclically and structurally supported into 2018, given NSC's region-leading volume growth vs. Eastern competitor CSX and sustainably improving free cash flow. To this point, our targeted FCF yield is a discount to NSC's historical valuation vs. cash flow. Downside risk to our price target could be driven by slower than expected efficiency gains if volume growth slows network fluidity and hurts incremental margins as catch-up resources are added, or a deceleration in overall rail freight demand. Norfolk Southern's appetite for increased intermodal volumes may have contributed to the higher multiple Susquehanna thinks the stock should trade at: after growing intermodal revenue by 10.6 percent from 2016 to 2017, NSC doubled-down and grew intermodal revenue by 18.3 percent from 2017 to 2018, according to Susquehanna's estimates. Contrast that to CSX's more modest intermodal revenue growth in the same period (4.2 and 7.4 percent), CEO Jim Foote's stated reluctance to take on more intermodal freight, and CSX's sub-80 percent on-time rate for intermodal delivery. In fact, last week CSX announced it will cut 230 more domestic intermodal pairs as of January 3, 2019. Still, CSX is Majors' favorite rail stock, because he believes that the process of rationalizing railroad's complicated, congested network—the result of consolidating nine separate railroads—is still in middle innings. Seaport Global's Kevin Sterling, on the other hand, said he likes Canadian Pacific best in an October 5 note, because it's the second-cheapest Class 1 stock after KSU, trading at 17.7x Seaport's 2019 forecast versus Canadian National at 18.5x. Sterling thinks that CP isn't finished optimizing and can pull its OR down to the high 50s by 2020. Investors have been impressed with what North American railroads have achieved in the 21st century in terms of efficiency and profitability; railroads went from moribund, bloated legacy businesses to achieving the best operating margins in the global transportation industry. We wonder, though, what the next steps will be. Will a return to ambitious volume growth come at the expense of OR? Will years of declining capex finally come home to roost in the form of increased accidents, infrastructure decay, and service levels dropping past what customers can tolerate? Finally, how will softening spot rates in the truckload sector—widely forecast for next year—affect railroads' ability to grow volumes, especially if freight demand falls off? In the next year or two, we should start see how railroad executives, investors, regulators, and customers strike the balance, and we'll begin to get a sense of what the first true post-Harrison strategy for adding value to railroads looks like.

2018-10-22,"Introduction To Precision Railroading, Part 1: The Industry's Savior Or Villain, Take Your Choice.","This article by FreightWaves advisor and intermodal consultant Brian Bowers is the first of three reviewing the controversial subject of precision railroading, an operational system and a management philosophy that in the railroad business today is leading to one question: which side are you on? Few topics in the rail industry elicit the emotional reaction of precision railroading. Advocates declare it to be a universal solution to transform performance while opponents believe that it is a shortsighted financial strategy. Finding the truth may be as challenging as understanding the creator of precision railroading, Hunter Harrison. After achieving significant breakthroughs applying the strategy to the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP), Harrison encountered a spectrum of problems when he applied the same plan at an American Class 1 railroad, CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX). Financial results have been good, but service provided to customers and employee morale have been reported to have suffered and are still being addressed. Financial performance during Harrison's tenure at Canadian National and Canadian Pacific was impressive. Harrison achieved the equivalent of a four minute mile breakthrough to establish a new standard for rail operating results. The operating ratio at both railroads dropped twenty points from the eighties to low sixties and high fifties. Shareholders benefited through the creation of billions of dollars in incremental market cap. So what's precision railroading all about? I've identified five key principles to it. Improving customer service by prioritizing delivery of customer shipments on fixed point to point schedules while minimizing in-transit work events. This allows customers to better plan for shipment arrivals and departures. Strict cost control across the organization Monitor the use of each asset to optimize utilization of railcars and locomotive power. Improved asset productivity creates incremental capacity and allows the diversion of capital to other areas of the railroad. Operating safely is a priority. Value, develop and empower employees at all levels. Those new standards now reverberate across the rail landscape. Each quarter rail performance is measured against those expectations for operating ratio improvement. Is it reasonable and prudent to expect that level of improvement at all North American railroads? Companies that have not adopted precision railroading might argue that these standards are not any different from their own. For example, what railroad would say that operating safely is not a priority? But first, the point to point schedules are significantly different from a hub and spoke system that a non-precision railroad might use. It's probably the key difference between the two. And critics of the system might argue that customer service suffers from precision railroading; it isn't enhanced by it, though some shippers would argue that service has improved. As other railroads join the precision railroading push, it is reasonable to ask whether the two company/transcontinental Canadian railroad environment is very different than the eastern United States. The long length of haul and lack of congestion on Canadian rails is very different than the compact operating environments of Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) and CSX. Did the much shorter length of haul or network congestion cause precision railroading implementation to derail at CSX? Did the success achieved in Canada result in changes to the pace and level of sensitivity to employees and customers? Click to learn more Will pressure from shareholder activists motivate leadership at the Norfolk Southern, BNSF or Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) to take similar action? Many believe that was the catalyst behind the Union Pacific announcement last month that it was initiating a precision railroading plan this fall. Earlier this month Matt Rose, the Executive Chairman at BNSF, announced his retirement effective in April, 2019. Under his leadership the BNSF has set the standard for growth and performance. What impact will the leadership change have on the long-term strategy at BNSF? These are all critical questions that will set the future direction for the railroad industry. Capital investment is a fundamental requirement to fuel growth and keeping a railroad viable. It typically equals 15 to 25 percent of total revenue. That level of investment makes it an easy target and annual battleground with investors. Individuals not familiar with the industry often question whether that level of investment is necessary. Network maintenance, the largest consumer of capital, is not sexy. The option of deferring investment in that area can look attractive. Maintenance of way, however, is critical to the long-term viability of a railroad and failure to maintain the required baseline can adversely impact safety and network capacity. Anyone who has lived through a railroad capital planning cycle understands the reality of prioritizing strategic projects whose cost inevitably exceeds available funds. Rail assets and infrastructure are expensive and often require extended time periods to plan, implement and earn a return on investment. This reality appears to conflict with the common perception of precision railroad's emphasis on operating ratio and short term results. Most industry leaders agree that performance can and needs to improve. Pat Ottensmeyer, the CEO at the Kansas City Southern, recently commented that, It's hard to spend money in this environment…when it might not have a clear short-term payoff. But in the long-term it could be useful and important. This is an important perspective that should be considered when assessing precision railroading. If rail or any mode disengages from the technological transformation that is occurring in global transportation, the long-term impact could be costly. Is the answer to modify the strategy to include selective strategic investment or do other options exist? Railroads have never resided on the leading edge of technology or change so getting this right is a critical challenge for industry leadership. Through a three-part series of articles we hope to better understand the value, impact and definition of precision railroading. We will look at how it is best applied and what modifications or alternatives are available to improve industry capacity, service and financial performance. Great organizations are driven by great strategies that create sustained value for all stakeholders – shareholders, employees, customers and service vendors. Input from all parties would be beneficial as we explore this intriguing strategy and the industry it serves. Let me know you thoughts at bbowers@freightwaves.com. Want more content like this?

2018-10-22,Today's Pickup: West Coast Ports Post Strongest September Volumes Ever,"The most favorable freight markets for trucks to enter are little changed from last week: Harrisburg, PA, Joliet, IL, Memphis, TN, and Los Angeles, CA lead the country in our Headhaul Index (HAUL.x), which subtracts a market's inbound volumes from its outbound volume. A higher headhaul value indicates a higher probability of finding a load coming out of a given market. Over the past two weeks, national tendered volumes (OTVI.USA) have regained momentum, gaining about 3.75 percent since bottoming on October 9. Outbound volumes from Savannah, New York, and Chicago all posted significant recoveries, and while volume growth out of Los Angeles was more anemic, an imbalance in capacity caused DAT dry van spot rates from Los Angeles to Dallas (DATVF.LAXDAL) to spike 19.3 percent since October 11, back up to $1.92/mile.

2018-10-23,Today's Pickup: No Frenzied Market Reaction To A Bearish Wall Street Report On Transport Sector,"Good day, It's always fascinating to see what makes markets move. On Monday, Morgan Stanley's transportation team put out a bearish report on the trucking and transport sector. While it changed its ratings on only a few stocks, it lowered the overall expectations of earnings per share by about 2 percent. At the heart of the Morgan Stanley changes was its view that the market very well may have peaked a few months ago, possibly on the back of a rush to beat tariffs, that there is little sign of the end-of-year peak season starting anytime soon, and capacity seems to be easing as well. The stock market reaction was a big shrug. While some of the stocks downgraded underperformed the broader market, other big names were up. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC), Marten Transport, Ltd (NASDAQ:MRTN), Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc (NYSE:KNX)…all of them higher (none were on the downgrade list). Compare that to the reaction a few months ago when a strong report from Werner Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ:WERN) led to the market believing that the peak had been reached—even though there were few signs of that in the Werner second quarter report--and a selloff occurred. Morgan Stanley's main argument is that a lot of trucking stocks are overvalued relative to what looks like a somewhat softer market, hence the correction. For Monday at least, investors didn't seem to think so. Don't miss MarketWaves 18. Register today Did you know? The Port of Tampa says it is Florida's largest port, fueled in part by cruise activity.

2018-10-24,The Word On Norfolk Southern: Wait Until February,"The specifics plan for Norfolk Southern Corp.'s (NYSE:NSC) adoption of precision railroading principles is going to have to wait until February. That message was delivered numerous times by the companyduring its third quarter analyst call on Wednesday. Management talked about what might be thought as a pre-precision railroading practice, with a process called clean sheets at the heart of it. But the specifics of just how much of precision railroading's principles will be adopted by the company will need to wait until a mid-February investors' day meeting in February. We will continue to push for the best possible results at Norfolk Southern, CEO Jim Squires said at one point on the call. We are confident of our prospects and will give you details of our new plan in February. He said something similar to that many times on the call when asked about how much adoption of precision railroading would be undertaken by the company. But though the analysts on the call were clearly eager for details, they weren't getting too many of them. Instead, as Squires said, Yes, we will be implementing precision railroading principles where they benefit customers and shareholders. Squires made reference to comments made on the call by COO Michael Wheeler, saying that the investors had heard Wheeler talk about precision railroading principles. But in the key review of what Wheeler said, he did not actually use the term precision railroading; still, it is clear that a system based on its principles was at the heart of what Norfolk Southern is studying. The clean sheeting is already going on. Wheeler said it is a deep dive into the local service yards. We expect to bring our service design folks, our customer service folks and our marketing folks in, he said of the process. The clean sheeting involved looking at all the local service schedules in operation in that facility, Wheeler said, and then we make sure they are synced up as good as they can be with the main track network. That involves talking to customers about how to get in and out of their facilities quicker. It's really intensive work that we do, Wheeler said. At the end of it, he added, we come out with a better more efficient operating plan. Wheeler said the work that has been done already was a boost to Norfolk Southern's third quarter earnings, which showed an improvement in operating ratio to 65.4 from 66.6 in the third quarter of 2017. Still, it is not in the sub-60 level that is being reported by fully adopted precision railroading railroads, like CSX, Norfolk Southern's biggest competitor in the eastern United States, CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX), reported an OR of 58.7 percent for the quarter. In a note to investors after the call, Deutsche Bank analysts led by Amit Mehorotra was positive about what he heard. Importantly, we got the sense from the call that the targets will be ambitious, and we estimate will likely translate to something in the neighborhood to 60 percent OR in the 2020 or 2021 time frame, the team wrote. As we have noted many times before... this type of profit improvement would translate to EPS that is well above 2020 consensus. One of the key provisions or goals of precision railroading is a smaller workforce. Squires gave a general answer when asked by an analyst on the call if Norfolk Southern would be more aggressive on headcount reduction. Labor productivity being a key component of overall productivity, we will be focusing on that element as we grow our new operating plan, he said. We expect to achieve greater labor productivity and asset productivity, he added, citing a better use of locomotives as an example. In another part of the call's Q&A, Squires said that the February reveal of the Norfolk Southern operating plan would put some pretty aggressive, ambitious goals out there for the OR and overall financial improvement. Total intermodal revenues were $746 million, a jump of 20 percent. When asked whether that was mostly just a function of a tight truck market and what might occur to the intermodal division if that marked eased, chief marketing officer Allan Shaw said Norfolk Southern's intermodal division has grown revenue for eight consecutive quarters, and that includes a very loose truck market at the end of 2016 as well as what we're experiencing right now. And Shaw said what they're hearing now is bullish. We're encouraged by what we're hearing from our channel partners on the outlook for next year, Shaw said. We still expect truck rates to go up and we expect intermodal loadings to go up, he said. If there is a gap between intermodal pricing and truck pricing, we're going to lean into it and price into it.

2018-10-29,"Introduction To Precision Railroading, Part 2: Parsing The Developments In Recent Earnings","This article by FreightWaves advisor and intermodal consultant Brian Bowers is the second of three reviewing the controversial subject of precision railroading, an operational system and a management philosophy that in the railroad business today is leading to one question: which side are you on? You can find the first installment of the series here. It has been an interesting week. I have been encouraged by the number of people that have reached out with opinions and ideas concerning precision railroading following the publication of my first of three entries on the topic. It is a subject that is redefining the rail landscape so it is a discussion that needs to occur. This week we are going to explore current performance within each of the five foundations of the strategy. 1. Improve customer service Improving service quality and consistency is key to achieving precision railroading. It makes sense that executing a simplified point to point network will produce the desired transit experience. The only problem is that it hasn't happened. Railroads tout improved train speeds, reduced terminal dwell time, improved locomotive utilization and reduction in cars on line. These metrics all reflect positively on internal operating efficiency but are not tied to the missing metric: on-time performance. You can't achieve what you don't measure and communicate. Railroads calculate on-time service performance but for some reason do not share it with investors nor hold operating personnel responsible to achieve it. Establishing on-time performance as a primary metric would transform service and provide real value to customers. CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) did publish train origination and arrival data in the third quarter financial report. Train originations improved to 85 percent and arrivals an anemic 64 percent. Both numbers improved significantly year-over-year but fall short of precision performance. They also reflect that cost tradeoffs appeared to occur during transit that delayed destination arrival. I am optimistic that enhanced execution of precision railroading can transform service quality but it will require changes in operational accountability and incentives. A shortcoming of the current strategy is its confinement to individual railroads. That strategy may function in the transcontinental Canadian rail configuration but it is not ideal in the United States. Expanding the aperture to include interline rail partners, drayage carriers, terminal operators and equipment suppliers will maximize efficiency for all parties including the beneficial owner. This is an encouraging component of the new Norfolk Southern initiative so hopefully it will be adapted across the industry.

Strict cost control across the organization Financial results have been a clear win for application of precision railroading. Operating ratios at the Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI), Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) and CSX have fallen into the high fifties while creating billions in incremental market cap. Improved asset utilization, significant reduction in force and strict cost controls have all contributed to this improvement. The strategy has been the catalyst for massive changes that were achieved in a very short timeframe. It has also created aggressive expectations for lower operating ratios that could push railroads to make short term decisions that may be detrimental to long term performance. The benefit to investors is obvious but must be weighed against the loss of talent and cultural disruption that has occurred. Thousands of employees have been laid off from the three railroads, straining relations with unions and white collar employees. It is a difficult task to find the ideal boundary between justified expense reduction and strategic investments. Advocates claim that poor execution and cost management required decisive action. Opponents fear that manpower, locomotive and facility cuts were excessive and have adversely impacted employee workload and network safety. I believe that the truth resides somewhere between both positions and will become clearer in the months to come. A key area for savings in precision railroading is equipment cost. Rightsizing the locomotive fleet eliminates ownership or leasing expense while also improving productivity by removing older and less reliable units. Operating expense benefits from better fuel economy and lower maintenance expense. Railroads pay a fee for every day that a rail car resides on their system. The strategy's focus on asset velocity is designed to lower this expense by reducing the days required to pick up and deliver a customer shipment. Scrutiny of the inventory of empty cars held on the network is also critical. This activity addresses a longstanding industry practice of carrying excess locomotive and rail car capacity. When executed well, precision railroading creates incremental capacity at lower cost. If the cutback in assets goes too far or if unforecasted demand spikes occur, corrective action is expensive. Getting this right is challenging because it is a new practice for the industry. Listening to the Canadian National and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) third quarter calls left me believing that they are managing to a more balanced process. The Canadian National operating ratio deteriorated 2.3 points to 59.5 due to significant maintenance of way and costs related to adding new train crews and technology. I was encouraged by the position taken by Canadian National CEO J.J. Ruest, to defend the balancing of current financial results and strategic investment in their infrastructure. Commentary from Norfolk Southern leadership indicated they understand the need for change. A key point of difference, however, is their commitment to take time to secure input from internal and external sources while they move forward. A new strategy called Clean Sheeting will be a blend of precision railroading and other strategies. Implementation has begun, and a detailed review was promised for delivery at the company investor day in February. The sub 60 operating ratio desired by investors did not occur in the quarter, but solid progress was achieved across many areas of their railroad. I applaud the leadership displayed by Jim Squires and his team to move forward in a thoughtful manner. 3. Monitor the use of each asset to optimize utilization of railcars and locomotive power. The use of asset trip plans that is associated with precision railroading is not new to the strategy. The change is enforcement of the plans within rail operations. Past plans were typically overridden as operations worked to move planned assets and unplanned coal and agriculture trains across their networks. Overcoming the inertia of old line rail operations that has been achieved through precision railroading is no small task. It took the iron will of Hunter Harrison to demand immediate change. Accelerated rationalization of network flows and core operating processes is having a significant impact on the efficiency and capacity of the engaged railroads. Expanding the effort to include on time delivery would position railroads to capitalize on the window of opportunity to convert highway traffic to intermodal. It would also address current terminal congestion by enabling customers to tighten scheduling of pickup and delivery carriers. It would also address current terminal congestion be enabling customers to schedule against predictable arrivals and departures. Should Read: Expanding the effort to include on time delivery would position railroads to capitalize on the window of opportunity to convert highway traffic to intermodal. It would also address current terminal congestion by enabling customers to tighten scheduling of pickup and delivery carriers. 4. Operating safely is a priority. It is difficult to identify any meaningful impact that precision railroading has on standard industry safety policy. Reducing the number of work events is a positive attribute but the reduction in manpower, if poorly managed, could negatively impact employee morale and engagement. 5. Value, develop and empower employees at all levels. Maintaining a productive company culture during periods of change is a challenge for any leader. Harrison's leadership style and passion for change created conflicts with union and non-union employees. Keith Creel, his successor at Canadian Pacific, has spent considerable time working to address and reverse conflicts at the railroad. Rebuilding and maintaining trust must be a focus for precision railroading to achieve sustainable success. Exploring the concept or precision railroading is a fascinating endeavor. It is interesting to hear the spectrum of definitions that have been applied to the strategy. Investors tend to be fixated on the operating ratios tied to its application. My guidance to Wall Street is to view lower operating ratios as an outcome not a goal. The most exciting value of precision railroading is the rapid pace of operational change that it has achieved. A healthy debate is beginning to emerge that I hope will retain the passion that Harrison contributed to the process with a more inclusive and strategic balance. Either way it will continue to be an interesting journey. Next week the third article in the series will focus on the future of precision railroading.

2018-11-05,"Introduction To Precision Railroading, Part 3: Where Do We Go From Here?","We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used to create them —Albert Einstein Last week we began exploration of the definition of precision railroading and how the industry is attempting to apply it. It is encouraging to see longstanding practices and processes being questioned. An equally troubling question is whether the right people are participating in the discussion and whether the current railroad culture allow open dialogue to occur. It hasn't in the past so changes will be needed if new outcomes are desired. Hunter Harrison solved this dilemma by dictating that changes would occur. Leaders at Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) have shared that a more traditional planning process will drive the change. How is that best achieved? Einstein's advice advocates the introduction of new perspectives, expertise and knowledge. Consultants have been engaged for many years and haven't been the answer. Perhaps retired industry leaders could be brought back that wouldn't be burdened with potential impact to their careers. Engagement of customers, suppliers or other functional experts should all be considered. Securing external facilitators would also help fight the gravitational pull of traditional rail culture. Railroads are under constant pressure from investors to pursue and apply precision railroading. Finding the right balance among cost reduction, capital investment, service performance and network capacity is a complicated process. The following challenges must be overcome for individual railroads and the industry to achieve sustainable success: Interline Rail Performance Canadian railroads are blessed with transcontinental networks that minimize the need to interchange trains and cars with other railroads. Unfortunately, the reality in the United States and Mexico is quite different. Trains moving over long lengths of haul typically will experience one and at times two rail interchanges. This requires operational and administrative coordination of crews, locomotives and rail cars. Reviewing current activity reflects a spectrum of effectiveness. Problems typically occur that are related to the balance of rail cars, blocking of trains by destination and network congestion. The result is often transit delays, utilization of less efficient alternative routes or customers left to manually achieve the connection. The grounding and crosstown movement of thousands of intermodal units each month in Chicago reflects this reality. The recent elimination of steel wheel interchanges by CSX Corporation​​​​​​​ (NYSE:CSX) and the western railroads is further evidence of retreating to your own franchise. My desire is to have the industry explore a more strategic solution to how interchanges occur, with the goal of identifying interchange solutions that can deliver improved transit performance and asset utilization for all parties. Request for public or private investment in infrastructure is likely to emerge from those discussions. I have never been an advocate of new rail mergers, but perhaps it is time to reopen that dialogue as well. Network and Asset Fluidity The number of railcars held on line is one of the industry's primary operating metrics. Maintaining an optimal fleet of cars is critical to meeting the needs of customers and keeping the network fluid. My concern lies in the potential that the focus on cost reduction will cut the car count below adequate levels. A large percentage of the industry car fleet is supplied and managed through TTX. Guidance from all railroads is utilized to determine the timing and amount of fleet adjustments. Considering the wide range in appetite for incremental cost that exists today between precision and non-precision railroads, I wonder how that process is functioning. Rightsizing of rail line-haul networks has created efficiencies but also reduced the amount of track available to store cars. Long-term storage often places cars in locations that are difficult and expensive to access. Railroads will need to work closely with customers across the network to maintain the right balance among cost, operating efficiency and network flow. Customer demand planning has often contributed to current inefficiencies through overstated forecasts and problems in operating processes and shipping & receiving facilities. Customer Interface and Engagement Railroads have a well-earned a reputation for being challenging to work with. Progress has been made but building a more productive line of communication and integration with customers would be beneficial. The Hunter Harrison model of precision railroading is built on the premise that customers benefit by modifying their load tender and service requirements around the railroad's more efficient model. That reality wasn't always communicated with sensitivity so many relationships have suffered. I believe that the optimal solution is for both parties to better understand the cost components and operating capabilities of each other. Solutions supported by precision execution should remove real cost and create value for both parties. Register Today Achieving Operational Excellence Achieving operational excellence is my greatest expectation for precision railroading. The strategy opens the door for the operational changes and process excellence required to deliver truck competitive service. Railroads have provided this level of intermodal performance to United Postal Service (NYSE:UPS) for many years. Raising network performance to that standard would produce a breakthrough in permanent truck conversion. Consistent premium service would entice new private investment in assets, improve network and terminal velocity and deliver enhanced financial results for railroads and their customers. UPS pricing and minimal terminal dwell performance reflects the potential that this change offers to the industry. Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) purchase of a refrigerated trucking company, Trans X Ltd., last week was an interesting strategic move. Trans X brings trucking expertise and technology that should expedite intermodal growth and operating efficiency. The rail landscape is littered with failed attempts to provide in-house drayage and trucking services. Customer frustration with problematic drayage service and management at Union Pacific's Loup unit reflects this dilemma. Their strategy has been to incentivize customers to shift from ramp-to-ramp service where they managed their own drayage to a door-to-door configuration. The logic to create market density similar to large asset competition is sound but the execution has fallen short. As Union Pacific leadership moves forward with precision railroading, Loup is one area that will require more--not fewer-- resources and headcount. Profitability Without Equal Value The investor call for improved operating ratios has at times lacked strategic balance with creation of customer value. Requests to remove assets and raise pricing need to reflect offsetting operation costs or improvement in value to customers. Sensitivity to how industry profitability is viewed by customers and regulators is needed to avoid a potential backlash or engagement from Washington. Repair the Culture Expedited implementation of precision railroading under Hunter Harrison was achieved but carried a significant cost to company culture at all three railroads. It appears that leadership at Canadian National has reestablished a level of trust, but work with union and non-union labor remains at CP and CSX. The message from Keith Creel at Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) is on track but will take time before the rank and file is comfortable sharing contrarian views and positions. Three models are emerging as industry leadership determines how they will respond to pressure from the investment community. Canadian Pacific and CSX are still operating within the Hunter Harrison model. Gaining active organizational engagement will be a challenge for leadership at both railroads. Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific and Kansas City Southern have communicated encouraging intent but will need to overcome the tendency to replicate current ineffective process. Leadership at Canadian National benefits from having completed implementation of precision railroading and having time to repair damage created in the process. CN and the unburdened BNSF—owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Class A (Nyse: BRK-A)-- are good bets for early success as the evolution of precision railroading continues. Hunter Harrison is gone but his legacy continues to drive transformational change in the rail industry. It is difficult to determine the outcome, but the journey will be interesting.

2018-11-07,Today's Pickup: What Midterm Elections May Mean For Transportation Funding,"FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) CEO Frederick Smith called out President Donald Trump for his views on global trade at an event in Singapore, calling his perspective quite rare. It wasn't a compliment. FreightWaves Markets Managing Editor Mark Solomon reported the story, noting Smith said the U.S. and the world are in a tug-o-war between the forces of free trade, which provide the best opportunity to pull millions out of poverty, and those of mercantilism and nationalism which seek to restrain will be self-defeating. FedEx is not dramatically affected by the trade tensions between the two countries because the traffic subject to tariffs make up a small percentage of its $70 billion in annual revenue. Did You Know? Since 2014, annual venture capital investment in TransportTech companies grew 24x to $2.68 billion year-to-date. Quotable: I'm very optimistic about the next few years. North America is coming back, but we also see opportunity around the world. —Justin Roberts, VP of corporate finance of Greenbrier, said during a presentation at Stephens New York Investment conference after several years of playing defense as the company cut costs and struggled with slowing orders In Other News: Voters reject oil well setbacks as Colorado's Proposition 112 defeated.

Airplane manufacturer Boeing said Wednesday that it has issued a bulletin to airlines worldwide warning of erroneous readings from flight-control software on its planes, after an almost-new Lion Air jetliner crashed into the sea soon after takeoff, killing the 189 people on board. (Washington Post) Final Thoughts While transportation was not a front-of-the-ticket issue for politicians in the midterm elections, FreightWaves Managing Editor Brain Straight reported on some significant developments when it came to funding, most notably in California. Last year, the state passed a fuels tax hike that increased the gasoline tax 12 cents and the diesel fuel tax 20 cents. The increases are expected to generate some $5.4 billion a year. On Tuesday, voters were asked in a referendum, Prop 6, whether the state should repeal the tax as well as a $50 per vehicle registration fee hike. The proposal was rejected by 55.3 percent to 44.7 percent of voters."
2018-12-10,Cowen Joins Chorus Of Trucking Bears But Says 3PLs Are Safe,"A freight broker at Echo Global Logistics. Last Thursday equities analysts from investment bank Cowen Inc. (NASDAQ:COWN) issued a trucking industry update following visits to Echo Global Logistics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ECHO), HUB Group Inc (NASDAQ:HUBG), and Redwood Logistics in Chicago. Cautious guidance from Echo's senior management on truckload rates in 2019 contributed to Cowen's somewhat bearish forecast, which falls in line with Morgan Stanley's recent projections. Trucking capacity remains relatively tight from a historical perspective but definitely has softened of late. TL pricing is expected to increase 0 percent -3 percent in '19, a negative sign for TL stocks, wrote Cowen analysts Jason Seidl and Matt Elkott. Cowen thinks—and we agree—that 3PLs and brokerages are generally in a safer position in a softening market than asset-based carriers. Currently brokerages are enjoying a wide (20 to 23 cents per mile) delta between average ‘contract' and spot rates, and incremental additions to trucking capacity, especially in small fleets that move brokered freight, have made it even easier for 3PLs to find trucks. In Cowen's view, a stabilizing, flat market where contract and spot rates converge poses a more serious downside risk to brokerages than a somewhat volatile softening market, where prices for capacity fall faster than shippers can react. ECHO generally locks into contract rates between Dec and March, Cowen said. ECHO is able to purchase transportation a little cheaper now, and as a result, net revenue margin has held up well. Expect that to change a bit to the downside if we get a flat market. If the market declines, however, we would expect gross margin gains, particularly in the first half of 2019. The relationship between ‘contract' and ‘spot' rates for trucking capacity is more complex than trucking companies and Wall Street analysts like to admit. ‘Contract' freight is, of course, not a legal commitment to move a load or pay; it just refers to a rate that both shipper and carrier have said they can accept. Far more important to a trucking carrier or asset-light logistics provider than average ‘contract' prices is the company's position on a shipper's routing guide. If a shipper has five transportation providers listed in order of preference on its routing guide, there could be a 100 percent difference in price between the first and fifth position. Tender rejections—also called ‘turndowns'—tell us about carrier sentiment and where in the routing guide shippers are finding capacity. As carrier reject loads tendered by shippers, the shippers work down their routing guides and the load gradually becomes more expensive. See the SONAR chart below, which shows daily levels for national tender rejections (OTRI.USA). With turndowns in the basement, we can infer that carriers in the first position in the routing guide, usually the cheapest option, are taking the freight. Therefore, instead of quoting ‘average' ‘contract' rates, industry analysts should be thinking about the very lowest part of that range, which will be much closer to spot. Turndowns have fallen off a cliff since the beginning of July. (Chart: FreightWaves SONAR) In an October 26 note on Echo's Q3 results, Stifel Financial Corp (NYSE:SF) analyst Bruce Chan was similarly optimistic about ECHO's business in a variety of market conditions. We anticipate low-to-mid-single-digit revenue growth through 2019 as persistent structural capacity tightness drives modest pricing gains as well as continued demand for Echo's services, Chan wrote. But if assuming a slow-growing or stagnating gross revenue line, one would also assume an offsetting expansion in gross margin, in our view. Stifel set ECHO's price target at $38, or 18.5x estimated 2020 EPS of $2.07; Cowen's price target for ECHO shares is $40. Cowen also heard from executives at Redwood Logistics about their views on rates going into next year. In terms of rate increases in [the first half of 2019], management believes that most customers are attempting to roll to June with same rates, at which point a low single digit increase is likely, Cowen wrote. Finally, Seidl and Elkott were bullish on Hub Group, given continued demand for intermodal services as port activity and railroad intermodal volumes are expected to grow next year. Cowen said that Hub Group expected price increases in the 5 percent range, and hoped that Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and Norfolk Southern Corp's (NYSE:NSC) adoption of precision scheduled railroading-inspired ‘Hunter principles' would not disrupt service as severely as what CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) experienced last year.

2018-12-13,Norfolk Southern Makes It Official: It's Moving HQ To Atlanta,"Eastern railroad Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) made it official today and said it will relocate its headquarters to Atlanta from Norfolk. The relocation, which is expected to take a couple of years, was finalized after the Atlanta City Council signed off a deal for the railroad to sell its property in Atlanta's downtown Gulch development to CIM Group, a real estate company. CEO James A. Squires told the Atlanta Business Chronicle that the company will relocate 100 employees next year into temporary offices at its current Atlanta location. The remaining 400 will move in 2021 when its new headquarters building, in Atlanta's lower midtown area, is expected to be completed, Squires told the paper. Norfolk Southern is in discussions to purchase a site in an area near the campus of Georgia Tech. Download it today About 2,025 employees are housed at the company's existing complex, in the Colony Square business area of midtown Atlanta north of the new building. Another 350 field employees will be moved to the new facility. Aside from the benefits of consolidating corporate workers at one location, the large number of flights at Hartsfield-Atlanta International Airport, the world's biggest for passenger traffic, was a key factor in the move, Squires said.

2018-12-18,Large 3PLs break into frothy Memphis headhaul market,"Long considered an asset stronghold, Memphis welcomes big brokerages Small and midsize brokers still find Memphis market difficult If you're a broker who wants to play in the Memphis freight market, you'd better come with capacity at scale and a willingness to feel some pain in order to build long-term, meaningful relationships. That's what we've been hearing from brokers at Trident, Avenger, Redwood, and Echo (NASDAQ:ECHO). There's a huge volume of freight outbound from Memphis, but until recently large asset-based carriers like JB Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT), Schneider (NYSE:SNDR), Werner (NASDAQ:WERN), and Knight-Swift Transportation (NYSE:KNX) have had the market locked up. Only in the past few years have major 3PLs made headway with high-volume shippers, and small brokerages still don't feel welcome. Memphis, Tennessee is one of the strongest headhaul markets in the country, consistently producing more outbound freight than it takes in. Even though it's not a major market in terms of absolute volume—Memphis tenders about a third of the loads that Atlanta does—the imbalance between inbound and outbound freight is roughly equivalent to Los Angeles. But why? SONAR's headhaul index measures the balance between outbound and inbound freight for any given market: it's calculated each day by simply subtracting inbound volume from outbound volume. Memphis (HAUL.MEM) scored a 63.08 last Friday; for reference, Los Angeles (HAUL.LAX) was at 63.51 and Chicago (HAUL.CHI) posted a 45.43. The higher the score, the more outbound freight a market has compared to inbound. Memphis is one of the most lopsided freight markets in the country. (Map: FreightWaves SONAR) The lopsided freight flows in and out of Memphis mean that shippers have to pay more to secure outbound capacity. You can see how Memphis' high headhaul score puts capacity at a premium by comparing it to another market like New Orleans (HAUL.MSY), which has a headhaul score of 12. According to DAT's RateView tool, over the past seven days dry vans from Memphis to Atlanta brought in $2.29/mile net of fuel, while the rate from New Orleans to Atlanta averaged only $1.71/mile net of fuel. Those lanes have maintained a fairly stable 50-60 ct/mile spread. What makes Memphis such an important source of trucking freight? There are two major factors: transportation infrastructure and large shippers. Five of North America's Class 1 railroads meet in Memphis: CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), BNSF (NYSE:BRK), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), and Canadian National (NYSE:CNI). That junction has made Memphis the third largest rail hub in the country after Chicago and St. Louis. There are also a number of very large shippers, from steel manufacturers like Nucor (NYSE:NUE) and Big River Steel to International Paper (NYSE:IP). FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) headquarters in Memphis also makes it a destination for e-commerce shippers who move high-value product and who need large quality carriers they can trust. Nike (NYSE:NKE) has 2.5M square feet of distribution center space in the market; Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) has more than 1M square feet in nearby Olive Branch. Those needs have tended to put a damper on small and midsize brokerages looking for an entry point into the market. There's so much freight coming out, but from a brokerage standpoint it's very difficult, admitted Carter Garret, VP at Trident Transport. We don't have a lot of leverage… at the end of the day Memphis is an asset stronghold due in part to the rail spur. You have a lot of trucking companies in the area, and they have good relationships with those shippers and dominate the freight going back in. We've never been able to establish a strong presence there, said Rush Feldhacker, VP of Sales at Trident. I've never seen anybody have a great brokerage set up of any size there. It's one of those areas where you don't try to compete that much because you're at a disadvantage; you're just not able to compete on price. Spot rates on outbound Memphis are inflated—it's difficult to get a truck for a reasonable price. Don't miss it. Register today. An executive at another Chattanooga-based brokerage agreed, and also said that working with the railroads was difficult for asset-light providers. The other challenge from a brokerage standpoint is the rail, said Jason Roberts, Director of Business Development at Avenger Logistics. In my experience, we have a big challenge trying to handle business coming in and out of the rail yards, because the rail has very specific requirements as to who can and cannot come into the yard. They want our MC number on the truck and there's extra registration involved for each yard. I had to get a truck driver to put a piece of cardboard with our MC number on the side of his truck just to get into the rail yard. Memphis has been a well-priced headhaul market for a long time, Roberts said, and carriers strategically allocated assets to the area. Price isn't what keeps us out, Roberts said. The previously established relationships with the current customer base that's there is what keeps us from really being able to put a dent in it. The challenge for the brokerage is how do you establish that same relationship and fill that value proposition to those customers who are already doing business with those carriers, Roberts said. It's about pushing out carriers who aren't based in Memphis into that area more often—and we have to rely on the business being there in order to sell the same piece to our trucks going into that market. Two larger Chicago-based brokerages said they have had more success convincing big shippers to give them freight. My view of Memphis is that it's an extremely strong secondary market, said Christopher Thornycroft, SVP of Operations at Redwood Logistics. It's not by volume the same as Chicago, Atlanta, or Los Angeles—it's different in that way, but it's so sustainable because it's the largest DC network in the country. Therefore you have carriers who have a heavy stream of regular freight, plus a just-in-time market that establishes itself. Redwood has more than 200 active carriers out of Memphis proper, Thornycroft said, and forty of those are designated as ‘strong relationships.' It's a market that gets impacted by produce, by retail, even by back-to-school, Thornycroft added. If there is a market out there, it touches Memphis. That does make it more difficult for some brokers to get involved, because you've got to have some skin in the game. A pricing algorithm is going to expose you to loss and you have to be able to hang on and grit your teeth, especially in the beginning years. It's a game of figuring out what don't [asset-based carriers] want, and if that's the case, it has its difficulties as well. But where there's pain, there's often opportunity, Thornycroft said. Adam Markman, Division VP at Echo Global Logistics, said that since about 2014 supply chain managers at large shippers have begun changing how they think about their transportation needs. Flexibility and creativity are now considered paramount, which has been a boon to 3PLs with access to lots of capacity. Supply chain managers say ‘this is how it was last year, not sure how it's gonna be this year,' Markman said. There can be multiple swings based on pricing and seasonality and some challenges based on shippers and relationships, but as the market has evolved over the last couple years, we've done well. There are larger corporations and shippers in Memphis who control a lot of the capacity, so you have to make adjustments based on that, Markman said, noting that 3PLs had a role to play on weekends and fulfilling otherwise difficult load/unload times.

2018-12-18,CSX to Double-Stack Trains Through Baltimore After Century-Old Tunnel is Fixed,"Project first suggested in 2002 may yet go forward as Port of Baltimore vies for hinterland freight movements. CSX Corp. (NYSE:CSX) is reversing course with a pledge of new funding to a long-delayed tunnel improvement project in Maryland, one that will allow the rail carrier to finally move double-stack trains through the Port of Baltimore. CSX, the third largest railroad company by revenue, and the state of Maryland are together committing $290 million to the Howard Street Tunnel project, according to the state's department of transportation. The Howard Street Tunnel is a 1.4-mile, single-track line that connects to the Port of Baltimore. The tunnel is the longest active underground train route on the U.S. East Coast. But due to its low height, the 121-year old tunnel is only able to accommodate single-stack trains currently. A heightening project for Howard Street has been table since 2002 in an effort to reduce traffic on Interstate 95. CSX had pledged to help shoulder some of cost for the tunnel, which it owns. Last year, CSX pulled out of the project, which had an original cost estimate between $1 billion and $3 billion. Maryland politicians started applying more pressure on the railroad to say why it was pulling out. The project has been reworked to notch the crown of the tunnel and lower the floor of the tunnel, substantially dropping the project's estimated cost to $445 million. CSX said in a statement that at the request of the Governor and Maryland's Congressional delegation, CSX Chief Executive Jim Foote agreed to review whether or not CSX could support moving forward with the Howard Street Tunnel project. With the cost lower, CSX can contribute to the project moving forward, recognizing, however, there will be greater need for public investment. CSX's specific contribution was not mentioned. But Deutsche Bank equity analysts say CSX will commit $91 million to the project. While the investment is below the $125 million that CSX originally planned to invest, the capital helps narrow the project's funding gap, Deutsche Bank said in a report. Don't miss it. Register today. Maryland plans to get the rest of the funding through a U.S. Department of Transportation grant program. The Port says it could handle 80,000 additional containers yearly once the project is done. Baltimore, the 13th largest port in the U.S. by volume, handles autos and light trucks, farm and construction machinery, imported gypsum, imported sugar, and imported aluminum. This is an essential project for the Port of Baltimore, Maryland, and the entire East Coast, said Maryland Governor Larry Hogan. Reconstructing the Howard Street Tunnel will create thousands of jobs, open up new trade lanes for the Port, and improve overall freight rail service across our nation. Deutsche Bank notes that East Coast ports have seen better growth than their West Coast peers thanks to additional volumes coming through the Panama Canal. The upshot is a shift towards East Coast ports has the potential to drive incremental demand for intermodal service at CSX, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI). Larry Gross, principal at intermodal consultancy Gross Transportation Consulting, says the project helps Baltimore better compete with its two largest neighbors, the Port of New York-New Jersey and the Port of Virginia, both of which offer double-stack service. The double-stack service will provide shippers more options to reach the Midwest and Ohio Valley via rail. Baltimore was suffering since it could not offer double-stack service, Gross said. Now that additional volume going inland is a jump ball for the ports, depending on the ocean carrier schedule, what the rail is charging and how efficient it is getting there.

2018-12-31,"Transport In 2018: The Year That ELDs, The Economy And The Driver Squeeze All Came Together","In no particular order, FreightWaves editors are recapping here what they see as the biggest stories impacting the trucking and transport sector this year. We didn't choose a number one story, and we didn't even make it a top 10; we've got 11 here. As we go into 2019 from 2018, here's a look back at some of the stories that made the biggest splash in the year about to end. 2018: a strong, unusual year for freight markets The exceptional volatility of 2017's fourth quarter carried over into the beginning of this year, flipping what is normally a soft, cool period for freight into a much tighter environment, lucrative for trucking carriers. The enforcement of the ELD mandate, which limited capacity, combined with stronger than expected economic growth, which increased demand and contributed to inflationary contract and spot rates in the first half of the year. Contract freight started to be repriced in March and April to reflect the tighter market. With shippers keen to avoid the transport costs-related earnings surprises of 2017, carriers were able to enjoy low double-digit increases in contract rates. Those increases proved to be enough to stabilize most freight markets, and tender rejections gradually decreased through the year, though they rose again during the June surge. Shippers were paying more to stay inside their routing guides, and the spread between contract and spot rates widened to as much as 23 cts per mile by the fall. The two major hurricanes to make landfall in the 2017 season, Florence and Michael, affected relatively sparsely populated areas that were not major logistics hubs. While local lanes were choked off, national capacity did not get sucked up by relief efforts to the extent it did when Hurricane Harvey flooded the city of Houston in August 2017. Finally, tariff deadlines and consequent pull-forward effects to avoid those duties broke peak season in two: West Coast container volumes in August were soft when they should have been hot and October was hot when it should have been soft. --John Paul Hampstead ELDs are even more here than they were The year started with the trucking industry adjusting to the soft launch of the electronic logging device mandate (ELD). As of April 1, the hard reality of the mandate hit with strict enforcement. While mass exodus of truck drivers did not occur, the industry suffered a capacity hit as drivers no longer had flexibility to cover loads. Lanes of 500-800 miles were particularly hard hit. Dean Croke, FreightWaves' chief analytics officer, estimated that drivers were driving 10% fewer miles, and choosing different freight – either shorter hauls that could be delivered in one day, or freight with higher rates to cover a second day of travel time. Joe DeLorenzo, director of the Office of Enforcement and Compliance for FMCSA, held a series of sessions with drivers to answer questions on the mandate, but the confusion persisted with Facebook groups popping up pushing for repeal of the rule. Numerous groups requested exemptions– some were granted, but a series of exemption requests, including one for small trucking businesses requested by the Owner-Operators Independent Drivers Association, were denied. As the year progressed, though, carriers and fleets started to adjust, but another reality raised its ugly head: the inflexibility of hours-of-service rules, which until the ELD mandate drivers managed, often through manually adjusting their paper logs, perhaps illegally so.--Brian Straight How our view of the ‘driver shortage' evolved this year The so-called ‘driver shortage', or the difficulty that large OTR carriers have in sourcing and retaining quality drivers, is one of the ATA's favorite talking points. After studying the problem for more than a year, though, we think we've developed a more sophisticated way of thinking about the problem. First, capacity constraints are about far more than the nationwide number of truck drivers as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Capacity can be constrained by external forces like hours-of-service regulations and it can be loosened by digital technologies that greatly reduce deadhead miles by matching loads more efficiently. Different lengths of haul have varying levels of constrained capacity, with mid-length hauls and tweener lanes becoming the priciest in the post-ELD landscape. Small and regional fleets have been able to add trucks and drivers much more easily than the mega carriers. We have spoken to midsize fleets that give their drivers at least 40 hours of home time every week, and we've spoken to one midsize fleet that has switched to compensating its drivers on a salary basis. It should be noted that driver wage inflation (12% in the past year or so) has brought more drivers into the industry. Our new metric estimates the number of working truck drivers by combining daily diesel fuel consumption data with daily hours-of-service data pulled from ELDs: we think that the number of drivers has increased by 2% since May. Finally, remember that the driver shortage can never simply be an absolute number, but has to be calculated in relation to freight demand, which is always more volatile than employment levels. If we experience a macroeconomic downturn in 2019, trucking rates will plummet, driver shortage or not. --John Paul Hampstead When running a railroad, a lot of companies want to be very precise There are now two types of class 1 railroads in Canada and the U.S.: those that have adopted or are adopted precision railroading, and those that have not yet declared their allegiance to the Hunter Harrison-founded system. As CSX (NASDAQ:CSX)—where Harrison was CEO until late 2017 when he unexpectedly died—produced decreasing operating ratios significantly less than 60, pressure ramped up on other railroads to adopt PSR. To sum up PSR and keep it short is difficult, but it involves less of a hub-and-spoke system, a tighter schedule that demands customer adherence to it and as a result fewer locomotives and fewer employees. The pressure on CSX eastern rival Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) to switch was intense; it will tell the world in February what it plans to do but it clearly plans on doing something. Union Pacific is all in, making the switch; Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) shows few signs of making the move, and BNSF, as a division of Berkshire Hathaway, has no outside shareholder pressure but an OR that would inevitably have caused it grief if it was a public company. The two Canadian railroads are early adopters. The Norfolk Southern February declaration will be the one to watch in early 2019.--John Kingston The Dynamex case, New Prime and the battle over contractor classification The past year saw many legal battles, but none perhaps, has as broad a potential impact as Dynamex Operations West Inc. v. Superior Court. The case involves Dynamex, a package and document delivery company, which plaintiffs said misclassified its drivers as independent contracts. In a lengthy opinion, the court ruled that the Dynamex must apply the ABC test, requiring that for the worker to be classified an independent contract, they must be free from control and direction of the hiring entity, that the worker performs work outside the usual course of the hiring entity's business; and that the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, or business of the same nature as the work performed. The court ruled against Dynamex and the California Supreme Court declined to rehear the case. The ruling could be felt across the transportation industry, which depends on independent contractors in many applications. The Supreme Court's ruling could make it more difficult for companies to label workers as independent contractors rather than employees. The Court embraced a standard presuming that all workers are employees instead of contractors and placed the burden on any entity classifying an individual as an independent contractor establishing that such classification is proper under the ABC test.--Brian Straight Two big verdicts take liability payouts to a whole new level There's no single barometer that says whether trucking companies are losing bigger liability verdicts in the court. As far as we know, nobody aggregates the awards and puts them into an index. But a lot of people in the industry don't think that's necessary for them to know that the awards against trucking companies are getting bigger. There were two in particular in 2018 that bolstered that view. One was against a company that is well-known: Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ: WERN) . The almost $90 million award was criticized roundly in social media discussion groups on the ground that the facts of the case should have exonerated the driver and his employer, not stuck it with a high eight-figure judgement. The second was against a lesser-known company, FTS International, that works in the oil fields where the facts of the case pointed to significant driver error. But in that one, the judgement of just over $100 million appears to be the largest single award ever handed down against a trucking company.--John Kingston The ATA listening tour and its proposed amendments to HOS The ELD mandate triggered concerns about the hours-of-service rules. It turns out that drivers may have been manipulating hours to some extent, and that ended once those hours were monitoring by electronic means. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, though, has recognized this problem and in the second half of the year began taking steps to fix it. In August, the agency published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking comment on how hours-of-service rules could be adjusted. It did so after a listening tour in which interested parties could discuss their views on HOS modifications. The big takeaway is that FMCSA has recognized there is a problem affecting drivers and the delivery of freight and is trying to work with the industry to solve that problem. Among the issues the agency is trying to address through a rulemaking is the on-duty time of drivers using the current 100-air-mile short haul exemption; extending the work day to account for adverse driving conditions; the 30-minute required break; and split-sleeper time. The last item could potentially give drivers more flexibility in determining when they stop to rest. The hope is that a formal rulemaking could begin early in 2019. One issue it did take care of late in the year: it ruled against California's plan to have its own break and rest rules. --Brian Straight Mining for Money along the last mile The gold rush into the last-mile delivery segment continued apace in 2018 as providers entered the market while incumbents expanded their service offerings. In the former, FedEx Freight, FedEx's (NYSE:FDX) LTL unit, piloted a dedicated last-mile delivery operation in Dallas with plans to expand into 4 more markets in the first-half of its 2019 fiscal year, which starts June 1. J.B. Hunt Transportation Services, Inc. introduced the first of 5 electric trucks that will be used for last-mile services. In the latter, XPO Logistics Inc., (NYSE:XPO) the market-leader for last-mile deliveries of heavy goods, started XPO Direct, an ambitious initiative that combines distribution centers, LTL and local delivery services in what the company has called a seamless, end-to-end alternative for firms put off with the cost of operating their own DCs. Then there is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The behemoth relentlessly built out its air and ground transport networks to support its wildly popular Prime ordering and delivery program. It agreed to lease 10 more freighters from flying partner Air Transport Services Group, which will bring to 50 the number of cargo craft leased to Amazon from ATSG and fellow Amazon partner Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (NASDAQ:AAWW). It also acquired 25,000 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans for its new ‘Delivery Service Partner' program, which it has described as helping people launch small delivery businesses. If 2018 was busy, 2019 promises to be even more so. At about 12 percent of total U.S. retail sales (18 percent if one excludes transactions like fuel purchases that can't be digitized) e-commerce is just scratching the surface. The surging volumes are likely to neutralize last-mile's historical characteristics of unpredictable network density and seasonal volatility. The US Postal Service's Parcel Select product, where pallets of packages are broken down and delivered from USPS' local delivery units to every U.S. address, has succeeded because it allows private players to avoid the last-mile pain points. Now, however, UPS Inc. (NYSE:UPS) ., FedEx Corp. and Amazon, which are Parcel Select's three biggest customers, want to divert an increasing amount of that traffic into their own networks, and they are determined to find ways to make it profitable. The last-mile hills are paved with gold for those players who can find ways to master its economics.--Mark Solomon Don't miss it. Register today. VC funding for transport tech startups accelerated exponentially This year, venture capital funding for transport tech startups came into its own, with more than $3B committed worldwide. Check out our white paper on the trend here. The first important number to grasp is the sector's hockey-stick growth: VC investment in transportation technology companies grew 24x since 2014. The sector was in its infancy in 2014, and that showed in the distribution of funding: out of a total of 56 deals, eleven were Angel rounds, 32 were Seed rounds, and six were Series A. In 2014, there were only two Series B rounds and no Series C or D rounds. In 2018, the landscape looked much different. Globally, venture capital news was dominated by the emergence of the Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Vision Fund, which raised a whopping $100B to invest in late-stage startups. Softbank poured $1.9B into China's Manbang Group, itself the result of an earlier merger of the two largest Chinese ‘Uber Freights'. Other big rounds this year include online maritime freight marketplace Freightos' $44M Series C and Convoy's massive $185M Series C raise, which took the digital brokerage to unicorn status. There are some signals that point to frothiness in the transport tech space: we wrote just a week ago that Transfix's Series D may be overpriced at 10x revenue. As the three largest digital brokerages (Uber Freight, Convoy, and Transfix) continue to build technology and absorb market share, expect a new wave of smaller software companies to enter the pipeline in 2019, firms providing boutique solutions to more specialized problem—startups that may eventually be acquisition targets for the tech heavyweights. --John Paul Hampstead The $100 million intermodal battle between two industry giants A legendary deal between J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT) and BNSF years ago laid the groundwork for the growing intermodal sector. J.B. Hunt is overwhelmingly an intermodal company: in the third quarter of 2018, its intermodal revenue was $1.22 billion, while its combined dedicated and truck divisions had combined revenue a bit more than half of that. But Hunt and BNSF have been locked in multiple arbitration battles for years regarding the division of revenues and earnings in the agreement. In the last few months of the year, we learned a few things we didn't know. First, the size of the current despite is $100 million. Second, it appears that BNSF is doing well in the arbitration process, as J.B. Hunt has announced several separate charges to its earnings as a result of decisions coming out of the arbitration process. Third, it may be getting near an end. But will the end truly be the end? A similar dispute was settled in arbitration I 2005 and declarations about the future relationship dissolved into this latest round of dispute-settling. Still, the containers from Hunt are still riding BNSF rails; there's just too much business at stake to shut it down.--John Kingston Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe Permalink"
2019-01-08,New Intermodal Rail Yard Aims To Boost Freight Flow From GCT's New Jersey Terminal,"Once dependent on drayage to move boxes to rail, GCT Bayonne now has near-dock rail to speed shipments to U.S. hinterland. The Port of New York and New Jersey's newest rail facility is now in operation, offering shippers easier intermodal access out of one the region's biggest marine terminals. The Port Jersey rail facility, which began service Monday, gives shippers who bring in containers from the Global Container Terminal's Bayonne container terminal access to the CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) rail networks. The GCT Bayonne terminal, located on a peninsula, had no direct rail service. Marine containers had to be trucked to a nearby ExpressRail facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, or to CSX's Kearny yard or Norfolk Southern's Croxton yard. The Port Jersey intermodal facility will initially consist of four tracks designed for active loading and unloading of cargo from the GCT Bayonne terminal that connect to a lead track to and from the main freight rail network. The yard will have two all-electric rail mounted gantry cranes for loading and unloading containers. The Port announced that the facility will be fully built out by the middle of 2020 with a 9,600-feet, eight-track working pad, two lead tracks, as well as additional support and train storage track. The $149 million facility is designed to handle 250,000 container lifts annually. From January through November 2018, the port's rail lifts were 593,806 containers, accounting for just about 9 percent of volumes. The Port is targeting 900,000 rail lifts annually, which it says will cut 1.5 million truck trips per year. The Port is marketing the new service to shippers looking to access inland markets in the Midwest and New England With more than 75 percent of the vessels arriving in the Port of New York and New Jersey as their first call, an efficient rail system can deliver cargo to an inland destination before the vessel reaches the next U.S. port, making our port a far more attractive destination for shippers, said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O'Toole. Don't miss it. Register today. Real estate research firm Jones Lang LaSalle (NYSE:JLL) stated that inland hubs such as Kansas City, Chicago, Memphis and Eastern Pennsylvania are benefitting from enhanced rail service from major U.S. seaports. Railroads are using expedited trains composed of a single type of car and can be several miles in length, according to JLL. Intermodal rail offers fewer delays for the end-user as containers may only be handled two or three times before arriving at the beneficial cargo owner's loading dock. Out of New Jersey, Norfolk Southern offers double-stacked container service to its Landers terminal in Chicago and its Atlanta Inman domestic terminal, JLL stated. Want more content like this?

2019-01-10,Which Sectors Are Best Poised For A Comeback In 2019?,"There’s no point in sugar coating it: the market has been garbage the past three months. Thanks in large part to the fourth quarter volatility, only two S&P sectors finished 2018 in the green: utilities (1.7 percent) and health care (3 percent). On the other hand, three of the remaining eight indices closed the year down more than 10 percent from their 2018-highs, while four find themselves down more than 20 percent from those high water marks. But it’s not all bad news. The first batch of significant economic data—December’s Employment Situation Summary—came in well above estimates. And just because a market has been hit hard, doesn’t mean it’s not being eyed by traders. Looking at fund flow data among several leveraged ETFs, we can get a clue as to which sectors short-term traders are most focused on heading into 2019. Transportation Among the hardest hit sectors since stocks began their freefall back in October, transportation stocks fell hard on fears of an impending recession. The Direxion Daily Transportation Bull 3X Shares ETF (NYSE:TPOR) leveraged ETF (which tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average) is down more than 50 percent off of its 2018 high. The sector has also been in mixed favor with investors, though it’s fund flow remains in the black over Q4 2018 at around $6.27 million. Source: ETF.com.

For standardized performance, click here However, while anxiety over slowing growth might have pulled many of the rail stocks back down to earth, Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) were trading at about 75-times earnings prior to their fall, both stocks also carried a track record of four quarters of top and bottom line beats. Additionally, with oil prices expected to remain depressed continuing into 2019, ground and air transports like United Continental Holdings (NYSE:UAL), United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) and Landstar System, Inc. (NASDAQ:LSTR) will at the very least have a lower overhead in the foreseeable future. Financials Despite the fact that 2018 posted the most interest rate hikes since before 2008 and the era of quantitative easing, a large swath of bank stocks finished 2018 down between 10-30 percent. Still, enthusiasm in the financial giants remains relatively high. Fund flow in the Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X Shares ETF (NYSE:FAS) is still at about $152 million. Source: ETF.com: Past performance is not indicative of future results. For standardized performance, click here Beyond favorable interest rate conditions for the large, legacy financial institutions, the sector also has momentum in Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Inc. (NYSE:MA), two of only a handful of large-cap financial stocks to come out of 2018 in the green. Gold Miners Finally, if there is a real crisis brewing for the markets in 2019, that would indicate it might finally be gold’s time to shine. Spot price in the metal has climbed 7.5 percent since October, which, while not staggering, is the steepest climb since late 2017. The precious metal’s modest momentum over the last three months of 2018 has, humorously enough, prompted a 45 percent uptick in the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:NUGT). However, gold has spent the past five years locked under $1,400/oz largely because supply has been so over-saturated. And, despite the gradual price creep, trader interest in the ETF is in the red at about -$249 million. Source: ETF.com: Past performance is not indicative of future results. For standardized performance, click here While you can see inflow tick up slightly in December, traders still don’t quite have the taste for the precious metals as a flight to safety.

2019-01-10,"Union Pacific: We Had A Very Good December After All, And Our OR Will Tick Up","Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) had a strong enough December that it now believes its full-year operating ratio for 2018 will be improved. In a Wednesday 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Union Pacific said it expects to report a record full-year operating ratio of 62.7 percent. That is just one-tenth of one percentage point better than in 2017. But that's not what the company predicted as recently as November. On November 29, at a conference held by Stephens Inc., UP executive vice president and COO Robert Knight said there would be no improvement in operating revenue for full-year 2018 operations. Don't miss it. Register today. In the SEC statement, UP said the improvement in late 2018 that is leading to the small improvement in operating revenue was created by higher revenue, lower diesel fuel prices and improved cost performance. It also quoted Knight as saying that December car loadings were stronger than expected, led by international container imports. But back in November, the outlook was more pessimistic. While volume growth is still strong, we are not seeing the normal seasonal ramp-up in our export grain business due to the tariffs and foreign competition, Knight said, according to a transcript of his presentation. He spoke also of the changes that UP had made as part of its Unified Plan 2020, UP's move toward precision railroading. While we are confident the actions we are taking will produce near-term results, the timing of these initiatives may not support an improved operating ratio performance for the full year 2018, Knight said back in November. While the improvement in operating revenue is tiny, it is significant in that the companies that have moved toward precision railroading – UP and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) – have been pressured to do so by the sub-60 operating revenues posted by CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) which is all in with precision railroading, as well as Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) and Canadian National (NYSE:CNI). Norfolk Southern is expected to disclose in February just what it intends to do on its precision railroading initiative, while Union Pacific made clear on its latest earnings call back in October that it is fully committed to the model. Union Pacific's stock closed Wednesday at $150.36 but was reported up after hours 1.8 percent by SeekingAlpha. However, Barchart was reporting before the Thursday opening that the stock was up just 0.4 percent. Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe Permalink"
2019-01-14,Intermodal Rail Taking Growing Share Of Containers Out Of NY-NJ Ports,"Intermodal rail is taking a growing share of container traffic coming out of the largest U.S. East Coast port as more heavy freight moves across the docks and trucking costs rise. Even so, some shippers remain wary of relying on intermodal rail due to the ongoing service changes being made in the push for precision scheduled railroading. Rail volume at the Port of New York and New Jersey saw a 14 percent rose in the period between January to November 2018, reaching 593,806 containers, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said. The November tally of 53,609 containers is the ninth month in a row that volumes have been above 50,000 containers, the port noted. Those volumes will grow more thanks to last week's opening of the Port Jersey rail facility. The facility is designed to handle 250,000 container moves. Overall, the Port Authority hopes to bring rail container moves to 900,000 annually. The volumes comes as the region's incumbents boost their service. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) expanded service out of the Global Container Terminals New York with seven Midwest destinations, compared with just two destinations previously. Norfolk Southern also scheduled five destinations out of the new Port Jersey rail facility. Likewise, CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) started offering service out of NY-NJ to its Northwest Ohio Intermodal terminal. Norfolk Southern vice president Ken Joyner says the surge in U.S. imports last year, with growth stronger on the East Coast than on the West Coast, also helped intermodal volumes. While tariffs had some impact on shippers' decision to build inventory, consumer demand was strong, and every major Eastern port saw growth, Joyner said. Larry Gross, president of Gross Transportation Consulting, says NY-NJ has advantages over other East Coast ports. The raising of the Bayonne Bridge in 2017 and the size of the region's consumer market means more frequent vessel calls by larger ships. All these East Coast ports are jockeying for this inland volume, Gross said. New York-New Jersey has a leg up because everybody calls there. The local volumes are so significant that you are not going to skip New York. An executive with an intermodal marketing company who spoke on condition of anonymity says tight trucking markets also likely play a role in the increase in intermodal rail. The hours of service mandate has slowed delivery times for drayage carriers. A 100-mile run from Elizabeth, NJ to West Chester, Pa. now takes two days due to traffic and the required driver breaks. Likewise, drayage drivers are being tied up longer in the ports due to congestion. The result is that drayage costs have gone from $600 to $800 per container to $1,400 to $1,600. Shorthaul Tender Reject Index for Elizabeth, NJ (Source: SONAR) The ports are so congested, they are keeping drivers three to four hours at a location, the executive said. They used to get four to six pulls per week. But they are lucky to get three to four pulls per week. He also adds that heavy, dense freight is going to intermodal. Furniture and home appliance imports through the NY-NJ ports have rising over the past year. The weight of refrigerators passing through NY-NJ hit a two year high of 9.5 million kilograms (20.9 million pounds) last September, according to U.S. customs data. Furniture freight reached 89 million kilograms last October, the highest since start of 2017. Don't miss it. Register today. Still, the intermodal executive says railroad service is not getting any better and the railroads are not giving us rates that are attracting rubber to rail. He says unexpected service changes, such as CSX's decision last year to cut a number of interline offerings with Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), leaves shippers wary of relying on intermodal for long-term contracts. We hear about PSR, but what does it mean for customers? he added. Overall, Norfolk Southern is running about the same number of intermodal railcars as it did a year ago. According to December data submitted to the Surface Transportation Board, Norfolk Southern had 10,386 intermodal cars, about flat with the amount it had last year. CSX, meanwhile, had 7,624 intermodal cars online, compared to 9,213 cars online last year. Still, intermodal service does not appear to have been downgraded much. CSX saw its average intermodal train speed reach 29.7 miles per hour in December, compared to an average speed of 28.5 mph since March 2017. Norfolk Southern saw its train speed reach 25.4 mph, compared to an average of 26.4 mph. Norfolk Southern continuously strives to improve service and reliability, and we have made changes over the past year to accommodate growth and better serve our customers' needs, Joyner said.

2019-01-14,Port Report: Busiest U.S. East Coast Port Improves Rail Service As Way To Reach U.S. Midwest,"A record-setting year for container imports into the Port of New York and New Jersey has not only benefitted ocean carriers serving the Port, but its two incumbent railroads, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) as well. Intermodal rail volumes from the Port rose 14 percent last year to total 593,806 twenty foot equivalent units (teu). This as overall container volume was up 6.5 percent to 6.5 million teu. The increase in intermodal rail stems from the railroads adding more stops in the U.S. Midwest out of the NY-NJ region. But trucking costs were also cited as one reason for the increase. Indeed, the Outbound Tender Reject Index for Elizabeth, NJ (SONAR: OTRI.EWR) shows trucking demand in the region dropping steadily through the end of last year. Source: SONAR Auto parts imports into the U.S. may fall The U.S imported $247.2 billion worth of auto parts and accessories from January through October 2018, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In term of ports of entry, inland border regions stood out. Laredo, Texas accounting for $50.3 billion in parts and Detroit, Mich. accounting for $38 .7 billion in parts. Los Angeles was third with $22.7 billion in sales. But those volumes could take a dip this year as the National Automobile Dealers Association is forecasting a 3 decline in auto sales this year, with unit sales reaching 16.8 million new cars and light trucks in 2019.

2019-01-14,A Former Counsel Of The Chief Rail U.S Rail Regulator Wonders About Its Future Mission,"With precision railroading looming as the dominant operating strategy in the North American rail sector, and with coal markets facing enormous competition from natural gas and renewables, Raymond Atkins asked a question: what's the proper role of the federal government in regulating railroads? Atkins was on a panel at the annual meeting in Washington of the Transportation Safety Board that looked at the role of the federal government in regulating the nation's rails. While much of the discussion got deep in the weeds on the elements of how the U.S. Surface Transportation Board figures out costs – the Uniform Rail Costing System (URCS) and the Stand-Alone Cost guidelines – came up frequently, Atkins, a lawyer with the firm of Sidley Austin and a former STB general counsel, asked a more existential question. In the airline industry and the trucking industry, they pretty much moved away from federal rate regulation after the late 70s and early 80s deregulation of those businesses, Atkins said. Why do they keep it for freight railroads? Much of the answer is coal, he said. There had always been concern during the formulation of the Staggers Act (railroad deregulation) that fully freeing railroads to set their own rates on moving their biggest product – coal – would filter its way down into the retail rates that homeowners and businesses ultimately pay. The concern back then was that the railroad had so much control over coal that they would jack up rates, Atkins said. Coal really drove the bus. But given the changes in electricity generation in the U.S., with natural gas now being used more than coal and renewables taking a larger piece of the pie, does that industry continue to justify federal regulation? Atkins asked. I would say it's an interesting question whether that continues to be the case. Atkins noted that chemical companies, highly dependent upon rail transportation, are putting many new facilities where they are captive to the railroads. He did not specify any particular plants, but ethane-dependent polymer plants are being built in the U.S. Midwest to take advantage of the natural gas boom in that region instead of being built on the U.S. Gulf Coast. On the Gulf, product can be exported by ship if rail rates aren't favorable. Yet the chemical companies are placing their new plants where they are captive to the railroads, Atkins said. They know that but they realize that captive is a relative term; that there are other factors governing the market that restrict just how much a railroad can charge its customers. Don't miss it. Register today. The big changes in coal are occurring at a time when there are equally sweeping changes in the operations of the nation's railroads, which Atkins referred to as the Hunter effect, or whatever you want to call it. The reference is to Hunter Harrison, the deceased father of precision railroading, now firmly in place at CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) and the two Canadian railroads and in the process of being implemented at Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC). What is the role of the STB in such a completely different system? Atkins said rail freight is going through a metamorphosis as railroads adopt to precision railroading. Do we send trains on a schedule no matter how full they are? he said, focusing in on the types of decisions that precision railroading needs to make. How much equipment do we have in the fleet? That latter issue is inevitably going to cause tensions with shippers, particularly given the growing friction between railroads and shippers on the amount of demurrage that the railroads are charging shippers for boxcars not returned in a timely manner. (STB chairwoman Ann Begeman wrote some of the railroads late last year to begin a discussion on that issue.) Atkins said change is coming and nobody likes change in the railroad industry. But he said while shippers don't like change, they are flexible. But federal regulators don't like change and you're seeing a lot of change. The rise of precision railroading is such a sweeping movement that regulators at the STB are going to need to figure out where it is appropriate to intrude versus places where they say we're hands off and we're not intruding in this. James Nolan, a rail expert and a professor at the University of Saskatchewan, agreed that the STB will need to become a more flexible agency and a quicker agency. Currently it is a regulatory agency that takes years to make decisions. By contrast, Transport Canada, the Canadian equivalent of the STB, largely leaves rail rates alone except for those pertaining to grain, which Nolan said is mostly a political issue. The Canadian approach, he said, is if it's competitive, let it be. Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe Permalink"
2019-01-17,"First Look: CSX Reports A Softer OR Than In The Third Quarter, But It's Still Better Than Last Year","--When CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) reported a third quarter 2018 operating ratio (OR) of 58.7 percent, an improvement of almost 1,000 basis points over the third quarter of 2017, it was such a stunning number that it set off enough discussion in the industry over the apparent enormous success of precision railroading (PSR) that Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) in fairly quick order followed suit by saying they were going to go down the PSR route (Union Pacific) or make changes that looked suspiciously like it (Norfolk Southern). In the fourth quarter of 2018, CSX's OR was 60.3 percent, which is a 400 basis point improvement over the 60.7 percent posted in the fourth quarter of 2017. (A lower OR is desirable, so 60.3 percent is better than 60.7 percent.) For the full year, CSX said its OR was 60.3 percent, which it said in its prepared earnings statement is a full year record for a Class 1 railroad. The outlook for 2019 that was to be delivered later Wednesday afternoon on the earnings call by CEO James Foote calls for the full year 2019 operating ratio to outperform the target of 60 percent that was set for 2020. --In slides prepared for that call and released by CSX, it said fourth quarter revenue was higher on almost all lines of business. Forest products and metals & equipment were both up 15 percent; chemicals and automotive were up 10 percent and agriculture & food products were up 8 percent. Intermodal rose 4 percent. Intermodal increased in both domestic and international markets, more than offsetting the impact of lane rationalizations, driven by existing customer growth, a tight truck market and new service offerings to inland ports, the company said in one slide. Intermodal volume rose 2 percent to 732,000 units and revenue per intermodal unit was up 3 percent – to $672 from $655. --Train velocity at 18.9 miles per hour was up significantly over the 16.2 mph reported a year ago, and terminal car dwell was down to 9.3 hours, a drop from 10.7 hours a year ago but an increase over the 9.0 hours of the third quarter. Reducing terminal car dwell is one of the key goals of precision railroading. Another goal is to reduce the amount of equipment out on the rails and get more out of the equipment that's still there. In that regard, CSX did well. In just one year its cars online is down to 122,873 from 137,167. Locomotive miles per day was up to 175 from 144 a year ago. Don't miss it. Register today. --Revenue for the quarter of $3.143 billion was up 10 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017. With so much emphasis on reducing headcount as part of precision railroading, labor and fringe costs were down just $3 million – but in a time of tight labor markets, that is a significant change. Operating income was up 11 percent to $1.249 billion, so it increased at only slightly higher rate than revenue. Net income plummeted on the back of tax expenses. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis were $1.10 per share, which SeekingAlpha said it two cents better than consensus forecasts while revenue was in line. --In a quick-hit reaction to the earnings, Deutsche Bank's Amit Mehrotra said the guidance for 2019 on outperforming the 2020 60% target OR is a bit disappointing, albeit largely reflecting a very strong 2018 base level. He said that the estimates among analysts for 2019 already were to beat that 60% figure--consensus OR is 59% and we're likely to be bullish at 58%)--and the restrained forecast is presumably reflecting uncertainty around macro, export coal volumes and land sales which drove 2018's very strong performance.

2019-01-18,KC Southern Joins The Move To Precision Railroading And Now It's Almost Unanimous,"Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) is going down the precision railroading track. In announcing its fourth quarter 2018 earnings, KCS President and CEO Patrick Ottensmeyer said the company in 2018 did not meet our own expectations for financial or operations performance. He added that KCS did not meet the expectations of our customers or shareowners, particularly in the areas of customer service and growth. The solution: adopt the principles of precision railroading. KCS has entered 2019 with a renewed and heightened focus on operational excellence, Ottensmeyer said. Throughout the year, we will implement principles of the Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) methodology that are most applicable to our network. We expect this focus on operational excellence and PSR principles to help drive improvement in asset utilization, cost and capital efficiency and customer satisfaction. The move by KCS shows how compelling the PSR story has become. At a conference just three months ago, Ottensmeyer sounded skeptical that precision railroading would be a policy that KCS would adopt. One of the things that concerns me and concerns the (Surface Transportation) Board is the focus that seems to be gaining momentum on cutting costs and cutting things that in the short-run might produce some benefits in term of improvement in operating ratio, Ottensmeyer said at a Washington, D.C. conference of shippers and railroads. Such an emphasis, he said, is not necessarily customer-focused. But now, the focus is on a railroad's operating ratio (OR). The lower the OR, the better the performance. A company improves when its OR goes down. KCS has gone all in. CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) announced that its fourth quarter OR was 60.3 percent but it was its 58.7 percent OR in the third quarter that jolted the railroad industry enough that both Union Pacific Corporaton (NYSE:UNP) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) said they were adopting PSR principles in response. With the two Canadian railroads already operating on a PSR basis, it leaves BNSF – owned by Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) – as the only Class 1 railroad not adopting PSR. KCS' OR for the quarter was 63.1% on a non-adjusted basis and 64.3% on an adjusted basis. That is an improvement over the 64% OR from the fourth quarter of 2017. In his earnings statement, Ottensmeyer said KCS will target an OR of 60 to 61% by 2021. A quick definition of precision railroading is difficult to agree on. But its basic principles include fewer hub-and-spoke operations, more rigid scheduled trains, tighter adherence to those schedules, quick turnaround of equipment (including a tougher stance on demurrage for equipment held by a recipient) and fewer workers. Don't miss it. Register today. The transportation team at Deutsche Bank led by Amit Mehrotra said in a note to investors that an improvement in OR to the level talked about by Ottensmeyer would mean an additional $8 per share in earnings power in 2021. KCS' full-year 2018 earnings per share were $6.13. But Mehrotra was cautious. He noted KCS didn't hit its most recent OR target, so investors are not likely to discount these targets until there is tangible evidence of progress, but nonetheless this is clearly a step in the right direction for KCS shares. Out of the gate, markets liked what they saw. At approximately 10:30 a.m., Kansas City Southern shares were up 6.48% to $110.89. Other rail stocks were higher though it isn't clear why improvements in one railroad would boost the fortunes of others. (KCS is overwhelmingly dependent upon cross-border trade, so it does not have as clear a competitor as CSX and Norfolk Southern might view each other in the eastern part of North America.) CSX was up 3.12% to $67.12, Norfolk Southern rose 2.28% to $168.85 and Union Pacific was up just under 2 percent to $100.49. All outpaced the broader S&P 500, which at that time was up about 0.67%.

2019-01-24,Port Report: Charleston Looks To Relieve Truck Traffic With Barge Service,"South Carolina's Charleston region is the latest coastal city looking to tap underutilized waterways for moving freight, and hopefully find more success than earlier projects. The Port of Charleston is looking to add a wharf space to the Wando Welch marine terminal for loading marine containers on barges. The barged containers would be brought to a new intermodal facility being developed in North Charleston from which containers could be hauled to nearby Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) terminals for inland distribution. Container-on-barge service is getting renewed attention across the country, particularly as port cities grapple with increasing amounts of truck congestion. The U.S. Department of Transportation first established the Marine Highway program in 2007 as part of the Energy Independence and Security Act. The program identified 18 marine corridors covering 29,000 miles of coastal and inland waterways for barge use in an effort to relieve traffic. By 2010, the Department of Transportation awarded $58 million in grants to early-stage barge projects, including one aimed at developing a regular container-on-barge service linking the Port of Oakland with inland California ports. But that service fizzled out due to a lack of demand from shippers who were concerned about its reliability over trucking. Still, the DOT persists in pushing container-on-barge services with more grants awarded last year to develop the Marine Highway system. Shutdown hurts U.S. ship financing U.S. Coast Guard service members continue to patrol the nations waters and inspect vessels for safety, all without pay. But the U.S. government's shutdown did cause the furlough of much of the 8,000 civilian employees that provide back-office support, specifically for recording liens and mortgages on U.S.-flagged commercial vessels. Ship owners and operators, therefore, are unable to purchase and document U.S.-flag commercial vessels, or obtain mortgage loans on documented vessels, FreightWaves John Gallagher reports. The impact could particularly hit the development of offshore wind projects, which requires the use of U.S.-flag and crewed offshore vessels for construction and supply. Don't miss it.

(Maritime Bulletin) U.S. ports had a merry, but hectic, Christmas It may not come as much of a surprise to truck drivers seeing the congestion at major U.S. ports, but container volumes surged last month. This was particularly true in December, which was the putative deadline before tariffs on Chinese goods were expected to rise. Blue Alpha Capital tallied the volumes and found a 3.5 percent increase in December, which was an acceleration from the 2.3 percent rise seen in November. Blue Alpha's John McCown attributed the rise to front loading to beat anticipated tariff increases. East Coast ports have seen better overall growth over the past 12 months thanks to the widening of the Panama Canal. But the pre-tariff rush pushed shippers to opt for West Coast discharge thanks to shorter transit times. West Coast ports saw 15 percent growth in container volumes versus 11 percent growth at East Coast and Gulf ports. With the next deadline for tariff talks coming in March, McCown says we can expect to see further front loading of shipments in the ensuing months. Want more content like this?

2019-01-25,Norfolk Southern Says Loosening Truck Markets Will Not Stop Its Intermodal Growth,"Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) posted strong fourth quarter and full 2018 results thanks to gains in its intermodal and coal car businesses. It further consoled investors as it said it was well on its way to 2020 plan to lower its operating ratio, thanks to ongoing tightness in truck markets. The soon-to-Atlanta-based railroad saw its operating income for the full year rise $3.96 billion, up 17 percent form a year earlier. Net income was up an even stronger 39 percent to $2.267 billion. The full-year operating ratio of 65.4 percent was a record for our company and our third consecutive year of OR improvement, said Chief Executive James Squires. Overall revenue was up 9 percent for the year to $11.4 billion, with each business unit seeing revenue-per-unit growth of 7 thanks to improved pricing and higher fuel surcharge revenue, said Alan Shaw, chief marketing officer. Year-over-year pricing was the highest in seven years in all business units, with strength in all units throughout the year. Its biggest segment, merchandise revenue, saw smaller revenue growth of 7 percent on flat volume. Chemical and agricultural carloads are growing most recently, but those increases were offset by weakness in automotive and construction materials Intermodal business saw a record breaking revenue and volume results for the quarter, thanks in part to tightness in the trucking sector and high levels of consumer spending has generated three consecutive quarters of record intermodal volumes, Shaw said. Fourth-quarter intermodal revenue gained 13 percent to $755 million with full-year revenue improving 17 percent to $2.89 billion. (Source: SONAR) Throughout the year, the trucking industry experienced capacity constraints and high rates, which supported strong growth in intermodal, Shaw said. International intermodal volumes were up 9 percent while domestic intermodal volumes were up 4 percent. The intermodal business looks set to grow this year thanks to the opening of the ExpressRail facility serving the GCT Bayonne container terminal and the increasing number of inland destinations it is reaching from the largest seaport on U.S. East Coast. . Norfolk Southern is also benefiting from increasing volumes coming from the Port of Charleston, which is linked to its service out of the Inland Port of Greer. Shaw acknowledged that weakness in the truck spot rates means there's more supply in the market, ready to take containers. But he says the outlook for intermodal remains strong as trucking supply still remains constrained. We've seen some loosening in the truck market, Shaw said. But the market is still tight. We are encouraged about what we hear in bid season and we are encouraged by what we hear from our channel partners with respect to their outlook for price and volumes as we move through 2019, Shaw said. Coal-related revenue was also up for the quarter thanks to strong utility demand during the run-up to winter and high natural gas prices in the quarter. Some utilities are screaming for coal, Shaw said as inventories dip down to 17 days in some cases. Increased demand for U.S. coal and favorable fuel price differentials led to revenue gains in export coal and crude oil, respectively, Shaw said. Learn more today As for operating metrics, those were mixed as Norfolk Southern saw train speed dip in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, but terminal dwell dropped one hour to 26 hours. It also pointed to improvements in train length, closing in on 6,000 feet for the fourth quarter. This, despite storing 300 locomotives in the fourth quarter and returning 100 locomotives, while handling record volumes and record gross ton miles, Squires said. Squires said the company will introduce more plans for driving efficiency at its upcoming investor day, which is February 11. Squires said the company started out with the goal of having a sub-65 percent operating ratio by the end of 2020. here we are with a 65.4 in 2019, which represents excellent progress under our strategic plan, Squires said. The operating ratio was positively impacted by the one-time gains of $111 million from property sales. But the company says top line results will benefit the operating ratio. The benefits to the operating ratio will come from improved revenue and continuing to push on productivity, said chief financial officer Cynthia Earhart. The operating ratio is still the highest among the Class 1 railroads that have reported so far, so we recognize that we have much more to do, Squires said. Want more content like this?

2019-01-25,Credit Suisse Stays Bullish On Norfolk Southern After Q4 Print,"Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) reported its fourth-quarter results that were ahead of expectations. Yet the company's operating results were disappointing if an unusually large gain from a property sale is excluded, in Credit Suisse's view. The Analyst Credit Suisse’s Allison Landry maintained an Outperform rating on Norfolk Southern and raised the price target from $175 to $181. The Thesis Although Norfolk Southern’s operating results improved versus the same quarter last year, the company’s expenses climbed due to higher re-crew rates, overtime costs, car hires and locomotive expenses, Landry said in a Friday note. Service metrics have improved, but the rate of progress “continues to stand in stark contrast” to CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), the analyst said. Norfolk Southern should be able to improve its operating results provided the volume and pricing environment remains supportive, Landry said. She expressed concern, however, regarding the company’s margins in the event the macro environment becomes more challenging, especially since its main competitor is strengthening its cost profile and service reliability. Credit Suisse raised its EPS estimates for 2019 and 2020 from $10.08 to $10.09 and from $11.25 to $11.31, respectively. Price Action Norfolk Southern shares were trading up 0.31 percent at $166.45 at the time of publication Friday.

2019-01-25,"Norfolk Southern's Earnings Looked Strong On The Surface, But They Had Plenty Of Critics","Although Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) touted its recent performance in releasing its fourth quarter 2018 earnings Thursday, the reaction among some analysts and investors was decidedly negative. Although stronger equity markets Friday helped lift Norfolk Southern's stock price – by approximately 11:30 a.m., it was up 0.52 percent to $166.81, a gain of 87 cents – the first reaction after the earnings call was decidedly negative. Norfolk Southern stock traded as low as $160.01 in overnight trade after closing Thursday, before the earnings release, at $165.94. Even with its midday gains, it was still underperforming broader indices on an up day. Deutsche Bank downgraded Norfolk Southern shares to Hold from Buy by the end of the day Thursday. The company's 4Q underlying OR [operating revenue] of 67.8 percent is 600 bps worse than the company's direct competitor (CSX) on an apples-to-apples basis and now is the worst among all North American Class 1 rails, the report from the team led by Amit Mehrotra said. The reference to CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) is based on its fourth quarter OR of 60.3 percent. It was below 60 percent in the third quarter. Norfolk Southern has said it is going to move toward precision railroading (PSR) principles in a program it is calling Clean Sheeting. It has an investor's day scheduled for February 11. A transcript of the earnings call supplied by SeekingAlpha shows Norfolk Southern executives several times during the call deferring questions from analysts to that day. We started out three years ago with the goal of the sub 65 operating ratio by 2020, and here we are with the 65.4 operating ratio in 2018, CEO Jim Squires said in response to an analyst's question. So that represents excellent progress under our prior strategic plan and we made many other financial improvements along the way. So, we are pleased with our performance up to this point. We recognize that we have much more to do and that we are intent on continuing to drive financial results and shareholder value in the future and we have a lot, lot more to say about that at Investor Day. The Deutsche report noted that Norfolk Southern will be competing against CSX for eastern business as the latter has done much of the heavy lifting. We believe CSX is ready and able to take spillover volumes and undoubtedly has a cost advantage which will likely make NSC's commercial discussions more difficult, the report said. The type of discussions Deutsche refers to are those where a railroad adopting PSR needs to go to its customers and lay out a plan that on the upside is intended to have more tightly adhered-to schedules, but which is less flexible in its service requirements for customers. They have been described by multiple rail executives as conversations that aren't fun to have but hold out the hope for a more disciplined and reliable service offering in the end. The bear argument is that NSC is likely to see market share losses to CSX as it implements PSR, the Deutsche report said. CSX has improved service and reduced costs. Indeed, lower structural costs are a potent recipe for market share wins. The report was not all negative. Deutsche said Norfolk Southern has always demonstrated strong cost management. But even after saying that, the report noted that there appears to be much more room for CSX on the cost side than we previously thought and PSR for Norfolk Southern will likely need to be more about network optimization than cost takeout. Our sense is this may be harder to achieve. Source: SONAR Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) transportation team, led by Ravi Shankar, may have had the understatement of the earnings season when it declared Friday that the financial performance of Norfolk Southern, strong on its face, was not what it seemed. We believe the market will be disappointed if OR targets fall short of the 60 percent in the next 2-3 years benchmarks that have been set by CSX and UNP originally, the report said. We believe it will be equally important to observe NSC's approach to volumes/growth as we believe it is unhealthy to have a hyper-focus on a singular OR number which may not be supportive of sustainable growth. Don't miss it. Register today. Two other analysts held their ground with their ratings on Norfolk Southern. At Merrill Lynch, Ken Hoexter wrote that many of the revenue numbers in the quarterly report were solid. NS posted underlying improvement, with service gains building through December, and strong volume and pricing increases leading into 2019, particularly in Intermodal, Merrill Lynch wrote. Nevertheless, in an environment where peer rails are posting large efficiency gains, NS saw a number of costs rise faster than its 3.1 percent carload growth. Merrill Lynch reiterated its Neutral recommendation on Norfolk Southern. It cut its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for this year by 2 percent and 3 percent respectively, to $10.40 and $11.60. EPS for 2018 was $9.51. At CFRA, Jim Corridore maintained its Hold recommendation on Norfolk Southern and raised its estimate of EPS for 2019 to $10.28 from $10.05. The increase was based on strong industry fundamentals offset in part by higher than peer average costs. We expect pressure to build on NSC to accelerate its operating margin improvement, and despite strong industry fundamentals and solid EPS growth, we see limited appreciation potential for the shares versus peers until they do, he wrote.

2019-01-29,"Hunt, NSC Intermodal Honchos Dish ELDs, Drivers, Equipment At SMC3 Event","The stated topic was intermodal in the post-ELD world. But it became more like free form at intermodal's highest managerial levels. Terry Matthews, executive vice president of intermodal at J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) and Jeff Heller, vice president of intermodal and automotive at Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) took the stage at the SMC3 winter meeting today in Atlanta to proffer their views on a range of subjects. On electronic logging devices (ELDs): Matthews said ELDs' impact, though substantial, would be confined largely to the first full year of implementation. Year 2, Matthews said, would find ELDs to be something in the past. As might have been expected, Matthews and Heller said most of the dislocation was in the 500- to 800-mile range, distances where one-day deliveries could easily turn into two. Trucking firms not prepared for the changeover have struggled and lost share to legacy ELD businesses. Heller added that Norfolk Southern has experienced strong intermodal growth on lanes such as Chicago-Columbus (Ohio) and Chicago-Cleveland, which he labelled ELD-sensitive markets. On drivers: Matthews said that the random driver is increasingly unavailable due to the cumulative effects of changes in hours of service regulations and enforcement of the ELD mandate. This has pushed more business to the dedicated contract carriage model, Matthews said. On the January effect: January 2018 launched one of the strongest first quarters for carriers in decades. Things have evened out in January 2019, according to both executives. The ELD mandate is not as much of a factor, and equipment, drivers and freight are better aligned than a year ago. Another tailwind, said Heller, is that Norfolk Southern's service reliability is better now than then. Speaking of which...2018 was not a stellar year for service for the railroads. And it wasn't a stellar year for Norfolk Southern, Heller admitted. The executive added that the railroad has turned the corner on service. Don't miss it. Register today. On driver availability: Matthews said Hunt is having a tough time finding regional drivers for drayage jobs of 250 miles or more. That could be a by-product of the ELD mandate's impact on drayage hours. And Hunt is paying more: Driver wages in the Midwest have risen by $12,000 to $15,000, the largest increase since Hunt entered intermodal in the 1980s, according to Matthews. One trend is that drivers who may have left the industry to take jobs in construction and in the gig economy are being lured back in by higher wages. About 30 percent of Hunt's driver hires in 2018 did not hold a driving job in the prior 30-90 days, Matthews said. On equipment: The trailer, displaced long ago by the container as intermodal's equipment of choice, again showed resurgence in 2018. Through November, trailers rose 12.4 percent year-over-year, while containers rose 5.2 percent. Of course, there was more than five times the container traffic than trailer traffic. Learn more today As was the case in 2017, tight truck capacity was seen as the reason for trailer growth. While stating that Norfolk Southern remains a double-stack container railroad, Heller added that we will find ways to help trailer freight. Trailers account for 6 to 8 percent of Norfolk Southern's approximately 4 million annual intermodal traffic, he said. Matthews added that a network bifurcation is in the offing, with some terminals being dedicated to trailers and others to be container-only. Heller said that it is difficult to combine trains with a mix of trailer and container equipment. There are also no new railcars coming online designed to handler trailers. That said, Heller vowed to explore how trailers fit into the double-stack system. They are very important in the intermodal world. There is adequate container equipment in the system, according to both executives. It should be noted, however, that there are no domestic box manufacturers; all of them come from China. Things look sanguine for the next four to five years on the box availability front. The next flashpoint is around 2025, when 25,000 aging containers could be taken out of service.

2019-01-29,"Winter Storm Jaden Hits Chicago Intermodal Hub, Slowing Train Speeds And Freight","The severe winter storm hitting the U.S. Midwest is impacting rail operations at one of the nation's largest intermodal hubs. A winter storm warning is in effect through Thursday for an area stretching from the Michigan peninsula down through Missouri. The Polar Vortex-created winter storm Jaden is bringing three to six inches of snow to the area, along with dangerously cold winds. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) warned customers that its Chicago intermodal facility is seeing a decline in drayage support as the extreme weather hits the trucking industry. As temperatures continue to drop, it is expected that driver availability will continue to weaken, Norfolk Southern said in a customer notice. Norfolk Southern plans to halt empty container returns at the Chicago intermodal hub this evening as the terminal yard fills up. Drivers in-gating at the Chicago yard will also have to take out a shipment to help terminal fluidity. Learn more today Norfolk Southern will also halt inbound loaded domestic and international container shipments headed to Chicago from its hubs in Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia. Its interline service with Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) will also be hit as it closes Chicago lanes for shipments to California, Nevada and Utah. The closures will not impact shipments for port locations. The Joliet, Ill. market shows an elevated level of outbound tenders (Source: SONAR) BNSF says it will shorten train lengths in the Midwest due to the extreme cold because of the potential of braking systems being impacted by reduced air flow. Train velocities will also be impacted due to this difficult operating environment, BNSF said in a statement. The railroad also warned that service levels at its Chicago and St. Paul intermodal facilities will be impacted by driver availability and slower turn times. Illinois is by far the most important state for railcar transits. Just over 12 million carloads went through the state in 2016, according to the Surface Transportation Board. The Intermodal Association of North America said that fourth-quarter container volumes coming through the U.S. Midwest reached 2.258 million, a 5 percent increase over a year ago.

2019-02-01,Flashback Friday: The ICC & The Railroads,"FreightWaves publishes articles that look back at various aspects of the transportation industry's history. If there are topics that you think would be of interest, please send them to media@freightwaves.com The Interstate Commerce Act was passed in response to rising public concern with the growing power and wealth of corporations, particularly railroads, during the late 19th century. At that time, railroads were the principal form of transportation for both people and goods, and the prices they charged and the practices they adopted greatly influenced the entire economy. To many, the railroads were perceived to have abused their power as a result of too little competition. Railroads also banded together to form trusts that fixed rates at higher levels than they could otherwise command. In addition, railroads often charged a higher price per mile for short hauls than for long hauls. This practice was perceived as discrimination against individuals and smaller businesses. Don't miss it. Register today. Responding to widespread public anger, a number of states passed legislation in an attempt to regulate the railroads. During the 1870s numerous constituencies, most notably the Grange (a national organization of farmers), sought Congressional action. However, Congress failed to act. In the 1886 case Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway Company v. Illinois, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state laws regulating interstate railroads were unconstitutional. The basis of the ruling was that the various state laws violated the Constitution's Commerce Clause, which grants Congress the exclusive power to regulate Commerce… among the several States… Congress passed the Interstate Commerce Act the following year and President Grover Cleveland signed the bill into law on February 4, 1887. In 1903, Congress passed the Elkins Act, which prohibited the railroads from granting rebates to their most valued customers. For example, while companies that were part of the trusts that existed at the time paid the posted rates, they demanded (and received) rebates on those payments. Therefore, the railroads' largest customers paid less for rail service than farmers and other small operators. While these customers may have been the railroads' largest customers, they were not liked by the railroads. The railroads had long resented being extorted by these large companies and were in favor of the legislation. The Elkins Act also mandated that rates had to be published and that violations would make both the railroad and the shipper liable for prosecution. While the law solved some problems, other issues still needed to be fixed. Learn more today In 1906, nearly 20 years after the ICC was first created, the Hepburn Railway Regulation Act was passed by Congress. It was one of the major legislative achievements of the Progressive Era in the United States and President Theodore Roosevelt was a major proponent of the bill. The Hepburn Act strengthened the ICC by: increasing the number of commissioners from five to seven; expanding its authority and empowering it to set maximum railroad rates, institute standardized accounting practices, and require railroads to file annual reports; placing the burden of proof on the shipper, not the ICC in appeals cases; and bringing other common carriers (businesses that transport goods or information for a fee), such as terminals, storage facilities, pipelines, ferries and others, under ICC jurisdiction. Don't miss these opportunities to improve your business. Register for one today. While these legislative changes provided the ICC greater oversight, they also led to unintended consequences. Over the course of time, ICC rules and regulations stifled price competition among the railroads. During World War I the federal government nationalized the railroads, and by the end of the war it had provided subsidies to the railroads of about $1.5 billion (in 1919 dollars; that would be equivalent to subsidies of nearly $21 billion today!). A key effort after the war was to make the railroads profitable. The Transportation Act of 1920 essentially turned the industry into a cartel, and mandated that the ICC establish rates to provide a fair rate of return. The legislation gave the ICC authority over the entry of railroads into the market, rail line abandonment, mergers between railroads, minimum rates, intrastate rates, and the issuing of new securities. But the Act did not work as intended; even during the prosperous 1920s, railroad earnings never reached what was deemed a fair rate of return. Moreover, competition from the growing trucking industry generated major problems for many of the railroads. In the 1930s, because of the Great Depression and increased competition from trucking, railroad profits dropped even further; for the first time, they were negative for the entire industry. Seeking to improve their profitability, railroad industry leaders, as well as ICC commissioners, urged Congress to regulate the trucking industry. This led to the Motor Carrier Act of 1935. From 1900-1975, ICC regulation of the railroads grew more burdensome and intrusive. They were prevented from abandoning unprofitable rail lines and business. Moreover, ICC regulations restricted rates and encouraged price collusion. By the late 1970s, many railroads faced bankruptcy, and the federal government faced the prospect of having to take over the railroads to keep them operating. When Congress enacted the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, it deregulated most railroad activities, including the relationship between the railroads and their customers where market competition existed. However, many rail customers felt that the ICC's implementation of the Staggers Rail Act did not provide as many protections for them as were included in the Act itself. After the Staggers Rail Act became law, the ICC allowed almost every proposed major railroad merger. However, when Congress passed the Act it did not remove the antitrust exemptions granted over the decades to the railroads. Download it today Fifteen years after the passage of the Staggers Rail Act, Congress passed the ICC Termination Act, which abolished the ICC and replaced it with the Surface Transportation Board. What has occurred in the rail industry since the Staggers Act was passed? Consolidation – the number of major railroads dropped from about 40 in 1980 to four in 2013 because of consolidation. At this time, four railroads including BNSF Railway (NYSE: BRK-A), CSX Transportation (NASDAQ:CSX), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) control over 90 percent of the rail traffic in the nation. In addition, three other railroads operate in the United States – the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific and the Kansas City Southern, which is classified as a major railroad but is similar to a regional carrier. Today, little competition exists in our nation's rail system for rail-dependent shippers. However, according to the Surface Transportation Board, railroad rates fell by 45 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars from 1984 to 1999.

2019-02-02,"ELDs And U.S. Container Surge Good For Intermodal In 2018, But 2019 Will Not Be Repeat","Five-year high in growth seen last year thanks to tariff front-loading and tight truck supply, but shippers likely to put brakes on growth this year. Intermodal volumes saw strong growth in 2018 as a limited truck supply met strong demand for containerized freight into the U.S. the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA) said. But the intermodal growth slowed toward the end of 2018, thanks to looser trucking markets. As for this year, the growth of intermodal will ebb as the supply of trucks increases. IANA said intermodal volumes rose 5.6 percent last year, the highest growth in five years. The rise in intermodal volumes came during a year when transportation networks across North America were hit with the one-two punch of more limited (truck) supply and higher demand. The start of the electronic logging device (ELD) mandate limited drivers' road time. At the same time, a record number of marine container imports came into the U.S. last year, driven by strong consumer demand and tariff-related front-loading. All intermodal markets recorded an increase, and all regions saw traffic climb during 2018, said Joni Casey, president and CEO of IANA. (Source: IANA) Marine containers, the main load of intermodal networks, saw a 5.4 percent gain, reaching 9.55 million containers last year. Domestic container volumes saw a smaller growth rate of just under 5 percent last year to reach 7.9 million containers. With fewer drivers available, trailer volumes were up almost 11 percent to 1.44 million for the year. Since the start of the ELD mandate, trailers carried on railcars have seen strong growth – 10 percent between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the third quarter of 2018. IANA noted that trucking capacity was very tight through June 2018. But the growth tapered during the fourth quarter. Trailers carried on railcar saw a small decline during the quarter, with domestic containers rising just 3.4 percent. Regionally, the trade lane between the Pacific Northwest and the Midwest was one of the strongest in the fourth quarter, with volumes gaining 13 percent. Marine containers led the gain thanks to high numbers of import containers coming into U.S. West Coast ports from China. The Northwest Seaport Alliance saw inbound container volumes coming into the ports of Seattle and Tacoma rise 13 percent through November 2018. The Southwest-to-South Central trade lane also saw growth – nearly 10 percent for the quarter thanks again to growth in container imports. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach combined saw 3.5 percent growth for inbound container volumes, reaching 8.125 million through November 2018. The Southwest-to-Midwest was still the largest trade lane for intermodal, but saw only small growth in volume. The 2018 results roughly mirror what the Class 1 railroads saw for intermodal last year. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) saw carload volumes in its intermodal business rise 6 percent last year to 4.38 million. BNSF's (NYSE: BRK-A) intermodal volumes were up 4 percent through the first nine months of 2018. The intra-Southeast market saw volume growth of 9.4 percent thanks to the record number of marine containers moving through the Port of Savannah last year. Northeast-to-Midwest trade lanes were up 9.8 percent as well. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) saw similar gains in its intermodal volumes last year. For 2019, IANA warns not to expect a repeat performance. While intermodal volumes will again grow, it will be a bit slower than 2018. Along with economic risks and the uncertain trade outlook, IANA said that trucking capacity is not expected to be as tight in 2018, a major factor for intermodal growth. The loosening of truck supply means the trailer segment may only see slight growth in 2019. Marine container volume also remains uncertain as the U.S. and China still grapple with how to resolve their trade differences. IANA says marine container volumes will likely rise between 2 and 3 percent this year, absent a further escalation of the trade war. Some of the major markets do appear to be cooling ahead of the upcoming Chinese New Year. Last year's growth markets are showing some cooling. SONAR's outbound tender rejection index for Seattle (SONAR: OTRI.SEA) saw an 8 percent decline from a year ago. The Los Angeles market (SONAR: OTRI.LAX) is off 11 percent from year-ago levels.

2019-02-12,"Norfolk Southern Lays Tracks For Cost Cuts, Service Improvements With 2021 Strategic Plan","Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) is starting a three-year sprint to improved profitability through the precision scheduled railroading (PSR) business model that's been embraced by a growing number of Class 1 railroads. The fourth-largest North American railroad by revenue, Norfolk Southern laid out the plans at an analyst day at its new headquarters in Atlanta. Chief Executive Officer Jim Squires said the new plan, called Thoroughbred Operating Plan 21, builds upon earlier work the railroad did that improved the ratio of operating expenses-to-revenue 740 basis points since 2015 to 65.4 percent last year. The TOP 21 plan aims to reduce that operating ratio to below 60 by 2021. We decided to adopt precision scheduled railroading because it works, Squires told analysts. In doing so, Norfolk Southern becomes the last of the major railroads serving the Eastern U.S. to implement some iteration of the operating strategy credited to the late Hunter Harrison. Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) have used PSR, which has brought their operating ratios to 60.3 percent and 61.6 percent, respectively, last year. Canadian Pacific Railway, Ltd (NYSE:CP), another Harrison-led rail operator, saw a 61.3 operating ratio in 2018. But the strategy remains controversial as it results in service cuts and lay-offs. Indeed, one element in Norfolk Southern's TOP 21 plan involves reducing non-union headcount by 500 by the end of this year and reducing annual average headcount by 3,000 by 2021. Learn more today NS had 26,662 employees at the end of last year. It will also reduce the number of locomotives in its fleet by 500 by 2021. It had 4,197 owned and leased locomotives at the end of last year. Along with increasing employee productivity, Norfolk Southern plans to use fewer, heavier trains, reduce delays and touchpoints for railcars, integrate the company's regional and national network, and drive down costs. The plan also entails better pricing for services and better understanding the cost of service. Norfolk Southern Chief Financial Officer Cindy Earhart said those efforts should yield annual growth of 5 percent in revenue. We are focused on improving revenue quality and capturing the value of the service we provide to customers, Earhart said. Bulk commodities and intermodal service are expected to be the main drivers of growth, Earhart said, adding that there's still a favorable pricing environment in truck competitive markets The TOP 21 plan will result in service changes that may not be to every customer's liking, Squires said. But the changes will mean more accurate scheduling for loads, he added. A network that takes into account the needs of most customers will not be ideal for every customer, Squires said. Our aim is to make service for those who do use our network is reliable and consistent as possible. The push for service consistency comes after an increasing number of delays facing Norfolk Southern's intermodal railcars. The railroad saw 14 weeks last year where 100 or more intermodal railcars had delays of at least two days, according to weekly service reports submitted to the Surface Transportation Board. In 2017, it saw zero weeks with that number of intermodal railcar delays. Equity analysts say TOP 21's goals are ambitious but should yield shareholder value if they succeed. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Bascome Majors said Norfolk Southern's plans are anything but a layup and achieving them would represent a substantial leap forward in productivity for Norfolk Southern. Majors says the key will be how much Norfolk Southern employees embrace TOP 21, noting an external effort to impose precision scheduled railroading on the railroad through its failed merger with Canadian Pacific in 2015. Our sense is there is real organizational buy-in to Norfolk Southern's PSR transition from the board level down, Majors said. We've seen similar leaps made at peers in recent years, and Jim Squires' team appears committed to delivering those results to their shareholders. Want more content like this?

2019-03-21,Midwest Floods Stymie Rail Operations,"BNSF (NYSE:BRK) and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) are grappling with the aftermath of the recent historic floods, with both companies scrambling to assess and repair damage as quickly as possible. BNSF yesterday alerted customers that multiple subdivisions remain out of service in Iowa, Missouri and Nebraska because of high water and track washouts. Service has been restored along lines between Lincoln and Alliance, Nebraska, and Sioux City, Iowa, to Sioux Falls and Aberdeen, South Dakota. However, service still remains offline on other subdivisions near Sioux City and Lincoln and Omaha, Nebraska. As a result, BNSF warned that significant delays and extended travel times could occur throughout the region. The rail company also said it is monitoring areas along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers that are at risk for service outages in the days ahead. While many destinations and facilities are still inaccessible, water levels are slowly receding, and crews are working aggressively to clear affected locations and repair damaged track, BNSF said. Updates on BNSF's outages, embargoed destinations and recovery efforts can be found here. UNP is also still experiencing delays on subdivisions in Iowa and Nebraska, and embargoes are still in place for some subdivisions. The railroad expects its Omaha and Columbus subdivisions in Nebraska to reopen by the end of this week as flood waters recede. However, the Lincoln subdivision in Nebraska may not reopen until next week while no reopening date has been set yet for the Falls City subdivision between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Kansas City, Kansas. Updates on UNP's outages and recovery efforts can be found here. Both UNP and BNSF said they are working to re-route trains. UNP said re-routed manifest shipments are experiencing delays of 72 to 96 hours. Meanwhile, the floods' aftermath isn't just affecting the western U.S. railroads. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) said flooding in Hannibal, Missouri is affecting rail and intermodal service between Decatur, Illinois, and Kansas City, Missouri. As a result, NSC is diverting trains that move between Kansas City and the Northeast through St. Louis. Delays of eight to 12 hours could result, and NSC expects the diversions to happen through next Friday, March 29. In response to flooding-related damage, the Federal Railroad Administration declared an emergency event on March 19, which enables the railroads to ask for waivers on safety regulations. The regional outages and delays also appear to be taking a hit on rail volumes. Investment firm Susquehanna Financial Group yesterday estimated that weekly rail volumes originating or starting out of the western U.S. were 12.5 percent lower for the week ending March 16 compared with the same period a year ago. In contrast, rail volumes originating from the eastern U.S. were 2.2 percent higher. Meanwhile, total U.S. rail volumes for the same week are down 8.8 percent at 240,317 carloads, according to the Association of American Railroads. Of that, grain carloads are 21.7 percent lower, at 18,619 carloads, and coal carloads are down 16 percent, at 72,190 carloads. U.S. grain carloads and coal carloads represented 7.7 percent and 30 percent, respectively, of total U.S. carload traffic this week. Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this?

2019-03-29,Will rail freight service benefit from better technology?,"FreightWaves is providing a forum – Market Voices – for a number of market experts. Jim Blaze is a railroad career economist with an engineering background and a strategic analysis outlook. Jim's career spans 21 years with Consolidated Rail Corporation (CONRAIL), 17 years with the rail engineering firm Zeta Tech Associates, 7 years with the State of Illinois Department of Transportation in Chicago urban goods movement research, and two years studying what to do with the seven bankrupt and unrecognizable Northeast railroads at the federal agency USRA. Now primarily a teacher and writer, Jim likes to focus on contrarian aspects of the railroad industry. Today, freight railroading has the opportunity to use two business processes to support better customer rail freight service, improve safety and generate higher returns for railroad investors. The senior management of North American railroads can integrate the benefits of precision scheduled railroading (PSR) with the robust new private communications networks and two- to four-meter accuracy of positive train control (PTC) technology. PSR seeks to improve return on investment with cargo delivery that is more truck-like in terms of reliability. The initial PSR results have been financial in nature. Shareholders, rather than freight customers, are receiving the early PSR benefits in the form of higher dividends and increased stock buybacks. Leaders like Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) chief executive officer Jean-Jacques Ruest are seeking a balanced outcome of increased customer service and returns to shareholders. At a recent Next Generation conference, Ruest stated that the emphasis on PSR cost savings is not sufficient to grow CN's railway business. He is taking a marketing approach instead of just a financial one. So far, the precision part of PSR has not produced outstanding results. Rail car arrivals at final destinations are not yet truck-like (in terms of on-time delivery). By using more scheduled train operations, the arrival time of rail cars at a shipper‘s dock has marginally increased from a range of 50 to 70 percent to a pattern of 75 to 80 percent. At the same time, financial improvements from the PSR model are producing annual earnings per share increases in the double-digit range. Returns on balance sheet assets have improved from an 8 to 12 percent range to a 15 percent or higher range since PSR was implemented widely. How can precision scheduled railroading improve even more? The answer is in the roll-out of the PTC safety device system. The digital age business hypothesis is that PSR and PTC can support each other. The simple message is that the solution to better precision-like scheduling of freight cars could be satisfied using the precise GPS-like features of PTC for train and crew dispatching. When Congress passed the federal law that mandates PTC (the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008), it wanted a train control system designed for a minimum level of functionality to prevent: train-to-train collisions; over-speed train derailments; incursions into established work zone limits along tracks; and the movement of a train through a switch left in the wrong position that could cause a crash into freight cars on sidings adjacent to warehouses or industrial plants. That was the minimal expected functionality of PTC. To be blunt, the railroads have collectively failed almost entirely to implement PTC. On October 29, 2015, the Positive Train Control Enforcement and Implementation Act of 2015 (PTCEI Act) was signed into law to extend the original statutory deadline for full implementation of PTC systems from December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2018. The PTCEI Act also established six criteria that a railroad must meet in order to qualify for an alternative schedule. Under the terms of the Act, each railroad was to fully implement a PTC system certified by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) on all required main lines by December 31, 2018 (unless the railroad qualified for and obtained FRA's approval of an alternative schedule). Railroads that received FRA approval must meet a deadline for full PTC system implementation no later than December 31, 2020. There are 41 railroads that were required by Congress to implement PTC systems by December 31, 2018. Only four railroads self-reported that they fully implemented an FRA-certified and interoperable PTC system on all of their required main lines. As of December 31, 2018, 33 railroads had submitted a written notification requesting FRA's review and approval of an alternative schedule, and each railroad provided documentation intended to demonstrate that they met – or, in many cases, exceeded – the six statutory criteria necessary to qualify for an alternative schedule under the PTCEI Act. Based on FRA's review of railroads' supporting documentation, the federal agency had approved nine railroads' alternative schedules as of December 28, 2018. Among the railroads with approved alternative schedules were: BNSF Railway; Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (NYSE:CP); CSX Transportation (NASDAQ:CSX); Kansas City Southern Railway (NYSE:KSU); Norfolk Southern Railway (NYSE:NSC); and Union Pacific Railroad (NYSE:UNP). Yet, PTC with its GPS real-time monitoring could be a game-changer, helping railroads compete against trucking's superior digital capabilities. Think of it this way. For many years, any trucking company or trucker using one of multiple GPS packages, or even the Waze app, has been able to track his or her vehicle location with precision. Truck and automobile drivers can estimate their final destination arrival (even if it is hundreds of miles away) within one or two minutes of driving time. Railroads have not been able to do that. Now they can. With the PTC navigation aids and a robust private railroad communications system integrated into PTC, railroads can now develop such digital software applications. To date, only a few railroads (like BNSF) have signaled to their customers and investors that they are committed to both the safety and the improved train and carload movement aspects offered by PTC. The Holy Grail-like mission of PSR has been to create, then monitor and execute rail carload freight movement using a carload trip plan. The North American railroads have been chasing that goal for about three decades. The PTC network of GPS constant position-reporting of trains on the rail industry's private radio network is the missing part. Leaders like BNSF's CEO Matt Rose and FRA's administrator Ron Batory are on record as defining this advanced Next Generation PTC Version Two as an accuracy enabler. At this time, traditional train dispatching efficiency is only about two-thirds to three-quarters effective according to Zeta Tech Associates Inc studies and other sources. Typical location information when a train is in a long signal block (perhaps 10 to more than 20 miles long) can be computed with PTC to exact head-end and rear-end location within six to 12 feet of track. That accuracy improvement can increase the number of trains moved along an otherwise restricted trains-per-day section of railroad. The improvement with software advances can be in the 20 percent or better range. The possible improved rail yard to rail yard movement and arrival of trains at the next yard or customer delivery point can also be improved. The target for carload freight delivered to a track siding at a plant or warehouse is 85 to 95 percent on-time as originally scheduled in a rail car's trip plan. Not exactly truck-beating performance. However, it is a huge improvement for freight customers who must suffer with today's 50 to 60 percent on-time percentages. What are the key components of PTC that will improve train and carload movement that are different than the use of GPS in trucking? The critical components of a railroad PTC system are: the on-board engineer's computer; the private communications digital network; the central dispatcher's computer console; the back-office data warehouse for PTC reads/writes actions; the way side track switch (open or closed) sensors operate; and the continuous GPS reads and transmissions. Railroads won't need to use cell phones or public cell networks to communicate in real and continuous time with trains. Writing and testing software to integrate things like rail car weights from automatic equipment identification (AEI) using radio frequency technology into braking algorithms and testing rail car trip plans is going to take some time. Early technical results may still be six months or more away. The technical delivery of better performance may not come from engineers or marketing folks. It is more likely that systems integrators in the Information Technology departments will create these new digital application packages. Ironically, the GPS enabler in systems comes from a federally mandated $10 billion capital investment in PTC. This amount equates to a decade or more of railroads' typical research and development programs, which are generally funded at 1 percent of revenue. In summary, rail freight could see a 20 to 33 percent improvement in on-time customer arrival service levels. This is still not truck-like. But it is much better than today. Railroad car cycle times might improve by 20 to 30 percent. Therefore, PTC may cause an unexpected commercial utility of GPS data that could pay huge dividends for railroads and their customers. In other words, shippers and freight rail car owners could see a huge productivity gain. This is a benefit that is long overdue… Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this?

2019-04-04,U.S. Rail Volumes Dip As Carriers Grapple With Flooding Impacts,"U.S. rail volumes fell again last week as rail service issues continue to plague the post-flooding Midwestern landscape. Total U.S. rail traffic dropped 4.6 percent to 509,958 carloads and intermodal units for the week ending March 30, according to the Association of American Railroads. Of that, carloads fell 8.9 percent to 241,906 units, while intermodal volume dipped 0.4 percent to 268,052 containers and trailers. Coal carloads last week generated the highest volume shipped last week, but they also saw the biggest decline. U.S. coal volumes totaled 60,984 carloads, down 26.3 percent from the same period in 2018. Carloads of nonmetallic minerals, the second highest volume shipped last week, were down 6.5 percent to 34,494 carloads. However, chemicals carloads rose 0.3 percent to 33,809 units. These commodities represented roughly 53 percent of total U.S. carload volume last week. Meanwhile, year-to-date volumes were also lower compared with the same period in 2018. Total U.S. carloads were down 3.1 percent at nearly 3.2 million units, while intermodal volumes were down 0.6 percent at nearly 3.5 million units. The decline in weekly U.S. rail traffic comes as the Midwest is still recovering from historic flooding. Rail carriers are also concerned about the cresting that could occur along the Mississippi River and other bodies of water. They are also monitoring the structural integrity of rail bridges and tracks in the region. Some locations will require more extensive repair work, including bridge reconstruction, before restoration of service is possible, BNSF (NYSE:BRK) said in a March 26 customer notification letter. We continue to utilize rerouting options where possible to move traffic through the area. Impacted customers tracing their freight may notice non-standard routings, locations and interchanges as well as extended transit times, BNSF said. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) is rerouting traffic because of flooding conditions at Hannibal, Missouri, and so it is asking trains travelling between Decatur, Illinois, and Kansas City, Missouri, to divert to St. Louis. The company said there could be delays of 12 to 24 hours. Meanwhile, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNO) said it is rerouting customers who use the Columbus subdivision between Fremont and Grand Island, Nebraska, and portions of the Falls City subdivision between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Kansas City, Kansas. Repairs to its Lincoln subdivision between Valley and Lincoln, Nebraska, could begin this month. Even rail carriers whose networks aren't in the flood-affected areas are feeling the effects of service disruptions on their lines. Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) said it is accepting some re-routed traffic from other railroads because of flooding. Also, traffic that would normally flow from other networks onto the KSU network is slowed or stopped because of flooding, the railroad said. Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this?

2019-04-05,Communication Key To Successful Transition To PSR,"Precision scheduled railroading (PSR) could benefit customers and shippers, but its deployment pace and how shippers respond to changes will be key to its success, panelists said yesterday at the Northeast Rail Shippers conference in Baltimore, Maryland. PSR is an operational model in which railcars run on a fixed schedule. All the Class I railroads except BNSF (NYSE:BRK) have deployed it, with Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) being the latest railroads to adopt the model. Detractors say PSR is a way for the railroads to increase profitability by slashing costs, while proponents say the model is needed to keep up with a 24/7 business model. Communication is a key factor in determining how well shippers adjust to the operational model, panelists said. That communication can occur at several levels. One is between the shipper and the Class I railroad. If the shipper doesn't know what will happen, they're going to buffer their supply chain to account for what might happen through measures such as padding extra days into their transit plans, said Ken Sherman, vice president and general manager for IntelliTrans, a Roper Technologies subsidiary that uses data to help clients make their supply chains more efficient. While PSR has helped increase velocity and reduce dwell times during transit, the pain points seem to occur at the origins and destinations, Sherman said. Keeping track of where there are changes in switching schedules at the last mile near the destination point is one way that shippers can improve service. Another level of communication is improving the coordination between Class I railroads as they each implement PSR, according to Kevin Acker, director of land transportation for the Americas for Chemours, a chemicals producer. I need the carriers to recognize that the network really is a network, Acker said. A third level of communication is between the shipper and the customer. Shippers have to manage customer service with customers who might not understand PSR, said Ross Corthell, director of transportation for Packaging Corporation of America (PCA), a cardboard and paper producer. In the more aggressive initial rollouts of precision railroading, PCA resorted to trucking to buck customers' frustrations with transit delays. While shippers can expect a continued focus on railroads' seeking to lower their operating ratio as well potential rate increases and accessorial charges, PSR could also bring about more transparent interchanges and continued improvement in door-to-door service, Acker said. PSR has also helped to reduce cycle times for shippers, resulting in shippers needing fewer cars and equipment, Corthell said. That reliability will benefit shippers in the long-term, he said. But keeping the communication lines open and ensuring there is enough capacity on the network will be key going forward for all stakeholders. The caution that I throw out is not to make the cuts so deep, Corthell said. Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe Permalink"
2019-04-05,Don't Pave Over This Infrastructure ETF,"With the 2020 presidential election cycle already off and running, investors may want to listen for candidates from both parties have to say infrastructure spending. Infrastructure exchange traded funds typically feature a mix of the industrial and materials sectors, among others, a trait that has been a boon for these funds this year. What Happened Among this year's best-performing infrastructure ETFs is the Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (CBOE:PAVE). PAVE, which turned two years old last month, is a departure from many infrastructure ETFs in that the Global X fund is dedicated to the U.S. infrastructure theme and isn't a global fund. PAVE is up 19 percent year to date and is outperforming the largest industrial and materials ETFs along the way, a relevant factoid because PAVE devotes about 93 percent of its weight to those sectors. Why It's Important Politics affect infrastructure spending and investments, but the good news is that this is one of the rare bipartisan issues. “The current administration and nearly all 2020 presidential candidates appear supportive of a major US infrastructure package,” according to Global X research. “Business interest in infrastructure investment is similarly high given its potential to boost economic productivity and growth. Indeed, despite partisan bickering, the 2020 federal budget is expected to include at least $200bn for infrastructure, as an early stage bid for the long-dreamed of trillion-dollar deal.” Even excluding politics, there are plenty of catalysts that could boost infrastructure investments, such as PAVE, over the long-term. “Politics aside, demand for infrastructure investment is driven by several factors, including demographic trends, depreciation of existing infrastructure, environmental risks, changing preferences and advances in technology,” said Global X. What's Next Over the near term, further upside for PAVE largely lies in the hand of railroad operators, which account for almost 16 percent of the fund's weight. Three of PAVE's top 10 holdings are railroad companies. CSX Corp. (NYSE:CSX), Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific Corp. (NYSE:UNP) report first-quarter earnings on April 16, April 24 and April 18, respectively. Those stocks combine for 9.40 percent of PAVE's weight.

2019-04-08,Norfolk Southern Official Seeks To Calm Shippers' Anxiety,"Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) chief marketing officer sought to assuage shippers' concerns at a rail shippers' conference on April 5, saying his company would engage with shippers and seek opportunities to grow capacity as NSC transitions to the precision scheduled railroading (PSR) operating model. NSC chief marketing officer Alan Shaw said NSC has been working with shippers as it implements PSR, an operating model in which railcars run on a fixed schedule. Proponents say the model will encourage network efficiencies, but some shippers are still undecided on whether PSR will actually produce those promised efficiencies. Detractors of PSR have also said that precision railroading is a way for the Class I railroads to shed assets in order to lower their operating ratio and please Wall Street investors. Financial goals are a balance of growth and productivity. Growth has just as much of an input or leverage as productivity, Shaw said at the North East Association of Rail Shippers conference in Baltimore, Maryland. Some shippers have been wary about PSR because of the rapid pace with which CSX (NYSE:CSX) rolled out the operating model in 2017.The quick pace of the rollout, coupled by what some shippers thought was a lack of communication by CSX, caught the attention of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). Shaw said NSC will be rolling out PSR across its network over the next one to two years, which should ease the transition. We're going to engineer some of these changes and take a measured approach, Shaw said. He pointed to efforts such as clean sheeting, which is NSC's initiative to shed redundancies, a tenet of precision railroading. Shaw said NSC has been working with regional and local management to find ways to tighten the response windows for shippers' inquiries and clear out congestion in the rail yards. Reducing yard congestion frees up extra cars, tracks and locomotives, which can then be deployed elsewhere, rationalized or sold if NSC no longer needs them. That's the capacity dividend, Shaw said. Another way NSC will implement PSR is through retrofitting its locomotives so that they can run longer and heavier trains. Those trains will also be co-mingled, meaning for instance that trains and lanes previously dedicated towards intermodal movements might also now have coal cars as part of the train. Shaw said NSC will continue to invest 16 percent to 18 percent of its revenue on capital expenditure projects. The capital investments will be for maintenance and growth opportunities, including developing customer-interfacing software that will shed more light on the whereabouts of a shipper's railcars. NSC will also develop five operating metrics that will assist in tracking transit times, which could provide some opportunity for shippers and regulators alike to see how PSR is affecting day-to-day operations, he explained. The STB will be seeing our metrics as a way to gauge how the transition is coming along, Shaw said. Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe Permalink"
2019-04-10,Shortline Railroads Essential To The Success Of Precision Railroading,"Precision scheduled railroading (PSR) can't succeed if the Class I railroads aren't able to fold the shortline railroads into the new operating model, according to one of the early developers of the precision railroading model. Class I railroads need the smaller freight railroads, called shortlines, because shortlines are often the companies that handle volumes at origination and destination before passing those volumes on at a Class I interchange. Their smaller size also helps them work more directly with customers. Precision railroading is very, very disruptive to shortlines because they have to figure out how to fit into that system, said Gil Lamphere at the North East Association of Rail Shippers conference in Baltimore last week. Lamphere is considered by some to be the original financier of PSR because of his former role as the chairman of Illinois Central Railway, a shortline that championed PSR decades ago. He's also a co-founder of MidSouth Rail, a former board member of Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) and Florida East Coast Railway and the current chairman of MidRail, a rail assets firm that seeks to make capital investments in the shortline space. While the debate on PSR, an operating model in which railcars are on a fixed schedule versus being dispatched on demand, has focused on the Class I railroads and shippers, the shortlines carry a great deal of freight traffic. Both the Class I railroads and shippers need shortlines to function effectively. The shortlines that have been able to work with their Class I partners often have had to go to the lower levels of management to smooth out service issues, Lamphere said. The American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association told FreightWaves after the conference that the shortline industry intends to be as engaged as possible in conversations surrounding PSR. The trade association said that while PSR has led to some improvements in service, the initial implementation has been disruptive for customers and shortlines alike. When PSR leads to running trains on schedule and more frequent and reliable service, that is a win for everybody and shortlines welcome that, association president Chuck Baker said. When PSR leads to walking away from any business, that's a loss for everybody, and we will work to avoid those situations whenever possible. Shortlines are all about customizing service to our customers and growing rail traffic one carload and customer at a time. Shortlines are generally happy to do that work on our end and then deliver that traffic to our Class I partners, and when we're all working together it's a beautiful thing, Baker said. How PSR affected rail service Executives on the conference's shortline panel differed on how the industry grappled with implementing precision railroading. Michael Bostwick, chief commercial officer for PanAm Railways, a shortline serving New England, said his company was able to negotiate service with CSX (NYSE:CSX) for a customer in part because of his company's willnessess to adapt and roll with the operational changes at CSX. It's a change of mentality that if you embrace, you'll find benefits, Bostwick said. Eric Jakubowski, chief commercial officer with Anacostia Rail Holdings, a company that operates six shortlines throughout the U.S., warned that while PSR can lower a company's operating ratio, making it potentially more attractive to investors, the railroads need to ensure that they stay reliable and consistent as they seek to cut costs. People believe [PSR] can drive benefits long-term, but there's a challenge that if you focus on one strategic number, you quicken the pace of rolling out the new operating model, Jakubowski said. Canton Railroad president John Magness said because of his company's proximity to CSX and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), any service changes following CSX and NSC's transition to PSR were minimal. However, his company experienced changes when it came to equipment ordering, and it saw an early shift in traffic from CSX to NSC, which has since eased up. Magness also said his company has had to work more closely with its customers to ensure their volumes navigate the new operating models efficiently. We have to do a better job than what we expect some of the Class I railroads to do. We have to fill in the blanks...Our customers have gotten better about filling in the blanks so that we give information to the Class I railroads beyond a carload's origin, destination and commodity, Magness said. Can more data help? As the freight rail industry transitions to precision railroading, having data along the supply chain could help all parties assess service needs. PSR champion and former CNI, Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) and CSX chairman, the late Hunter [Harrison] was a data mining freak and that's what allows data to be effective today, Jakubowski said. The advantage is that you can make real-time decisions. But there are also some big gaps with data…[because] we're handcuffed to this legacy technology and we need something revolutionary. The Class I railroads and their partners must share data, with the view that information isn't proprietary, so that it can provide transparency along the supply chain, Jakubowski said. Class I railroads are realizing that their partners' attitudes towards data and transparency are shifting, and data availability can help all parties assess factors such as on-time performance and the availability of railcars, power units and crews. You want to treat everyone's railcar movement as FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) does for a package, Magness said. Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this?

2019-04-16,"U.S. Department Of Agriculture Lowers Export Estimates For Corn, Wheat","The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) lowered its export projections for corn and wheat in the 2018-2019 harvest season amid slumping grain volumes and Midwest rail operations coping from last month's record flooding. In USDA's World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report that it updates monthly, USDA estimated that U.S. corn exports will total 945 million bushels in 2018-2019, compared with its March estimate of 965 million bushels. These estimates are higher than the 901 million bushels exported in 2017-2018 but lower than the nearly 1.1 billion bushels exported in 2016-2017. The marketing year runs from September 1 through August 31 for corn and soybeans and from June 1 to May 31 for wheat. U.S. corn exports are projected to total 2.3 billion bushels, down from estimates in March of nearly 2.38 billion bushels. The most recent estimate is down from the 2.4 billion bushels exported in 2017-2018 but in line with the roughly 2.3 billion bushels exported in 2016-2017. USDA kept its estimate for U.S. soybean exports unchanged, at 1.88 billion bushels. This estimate is down from 2.13 billion bushels and 2.17 billion bushels exported in 2017-2018 and 2016-2017, respectively. The lowered export estimates come as U.S. railroads have hauled less grain so far this year compared with the same period in 2018. For the first 14 weeks of 2019, U.S. grain volumes totaled 299,328 carloads, down 5.2 percent from the same timeframe a year ago, according to the Association of American Railroads. The reduced grain volumes partly reflect the service disruptions and embargoes that occurred in the Midwest because of last month's record flooding. While service continues to improve, a few lines are still grappling with issues. Both BNSF and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) are experiencing service issues near Hannibal, Missouri because of flooding on the Mississippi River, while Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is watching water levels and flooding conditions near St. Paul, Minnesota. UNP also expects repairs to continue on two subdivisions through late April and May. Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe Permalink"
2019-04-17,Kansas City Southern's First-Quarter Net Profit Jumps 16 Percent,"Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) said its first quarter 2019 net profits rose nearly 16 percent amid its ongoing transition to precision scheduled railroading (PSR). Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2019 totaled $154.9 million, or $1.54 per share, compared with $133.8 million, or $1.30 per share, for the first quarter of 2018. Record first quarter revenue of $675 million boosted profits, even though overall carloads declined by 1 percent over service interruptions at Lázaro Cárdenas, Mexico because of teacher protests, KSU said. First quarter revenue rose 6 percent from the $639 million in the first quarter of 2018. First quarter revenue growth was due to increased volumes in chemical and petroleum, agricultural and minerals, and energy and industrial and consumer products, KSU said. KSU's adjusted operating ratio was 64.2 percent in the first quarter of this year, compared with 65.8 percent for the same period a year ago. The reduced operating ratio comes as KSU transitions to PSR, an operating tool that can lower company expenses as it seeks to maximize a company's assets. Using PSR, railroads schedule railcars on a fixed schedule rather than on an on-demand basis. KCS adopted PSR in January, following other Class I railroads that have deployed in recent years, including CSX (NYSE:CSX), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP). Although we are still in the early stages of implementation, KCS' transition to a precision-scheduled network is already producing improved velocity and dwell, which is driving improved customer service, labor and asset utilization as well as other efficiencies, said KSU president and chief executive officer.

2019-04-24,Norfolk Southern Reports Record First Quarter Earnings,"Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) reported record first quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) for 1Q 2019. The company's diluted EPS came in at $2.51, a 30 percent increase year-over-year, outpacing analyst estimates of $2.18. NSC has beaten EPS estimates every quarter for the past two years. The company posted an operating ratio (OR) of 66 percent, improving on its fourth quarter 2018 OR of 67.8 percent and setting a first quarter record. Deutsche Bank criticized the company's high OR in comparison to its competitors after its earnings call last quarter. The company's fourth quarter underlying OR of 67.8 percent is 600 bps worse than the company's direct competitor (CSX) on an apples-to-apples basis, the report from the team led by Amit Mehrotra said. First quarter results still show a wide gap in operating ratio between NSC and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), with CSX reporting an OR of 59.5 percent. The operating ratio measures the efficiency of a company's management by comparing the company's total operating expenses to net sales. Operating ratio is often used in capital-intensive industries and industries that require a large percentage of revenues to maintain operations, such as railroads. The company's first-quarter net income rose 23 percent year-over-year, coming in at $677 million. This was due to a 16 percent increase in income from railway operations, as well as an increase in other income, according to NSC's earnings release. Our first-quarter results reflect the initial steps in the implementation of our new strategic plan that are transforming our company, said James Squires, Norfolk Southern chairman, president and CEO. We set company records for many financial measures in the first quarter, while improving our service product for our customers. We are intensely focused on the execution of the initiatives in our strategic plan that will drive shareholder value. Image: Norfolk Southern The company's railway operating revenue also broke a first quarter record, increasing 5 percent year-over-year to $2.8 billion. NSC attributed the climb to an increase in revenue per unit, resulting from increased rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Revenue was in-line with analyst estimates of $2.82 billion. Railway operating expenses for the first quarter of 2019 were $1.9 billion, an $8 million decrease from the same quarter last year. The company said fuel price declines and lower compensation and benefits expenses were offset by increased purchased services and rents. Income from railway operations set another first-quarter record, climbing 16 percent year-over-year to $966 million. The company's stock was up $0.14, or about 0.07 percent, in pre-market trading Wednesday, April 24.

2019-04-25,Norfolk Southern Poised To Start Next Stage Of New Operating Plan,"Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) expects to have the next stage of its new operating plan in place by the end of July. July is where we really go in and reconfigure [NSC's] operating plan itself, NSC president and chief executive Jim Squires told investors during the company's first quarter earnings call on April 24. In this next stage, which NSC dubs TOP 21, the railroad will seek to run heavier trains and have them run faster along some routes. TOP21 follows an initial stage called clean sheeting, in which marketing, customers and yard employees worked at the local level to determine where capacity could be freed up at the yards. Both TOP21 and clean sheeting are part of NSC's wider efforts to incorporate precision scheduled railroading, an operating tool which seeks to schedule railcars on a fixed schedule, throughout Norfolk Southern's network. NSC seeks to reach a full-year operating ratio of 60 percent by 2021, with capital expenditures at between 16 percent and 18 percent of revenue. As NSC implements TOP21, the railroad also plans to close more classification yards and reduce headcount as a result of faster velocities and less need to recrew trains. Some of our small local serving yards we've actually already kind of taken out and stopped using them. And there are just little ones here across different areas of the network that we got out of clean sheeting, Norfolk Southern chief operating officer Mike Wheeler said. On the large terminals, as we implement the new train plan, the work will go away at some terminals. And as that work goes away, then we will rationalize those assets, Wheeler said. In order for Norfolk Southern to rely less on its major terminals and establish a more fixed train schedule, the railroad plans to expand its use of distributed power, which places locomotives at the head and middle of the train and allows a train to carry heavier volumes. NSC also said it wants to drive more unit train business to its manifest trains. Unit trains carry a single commodity, such as grain or coal, while manifest trains pull different types of railcars, such as boxcars, tank cars and hoppers, on one train. Manifest trains can consist of merchandise commodities such as forest products, automotive and metals. The company said these two measures will enable NSC to run some merchandise trains at 60 mph along certain routes, which is the speed that intermodal trains run. By speeding up the manifest trains, Norfolk Southern will be able to co-mingle its intermodal and merchandise networks. As we co-mingle traffic on trains, a train becomes a train, and we really don't want to have an intermodal speed and a merchandise speed out there, Wheeler said. So we've raised them up where appropriate to all run at 60 mph and take advantage of the velocity improvements and keep everything moving. So far in the first quarter, average train speed was 21.7 mph, a 14 percent increase from the 19 mph average in the first quarter of 2018. Terminal dwell time, or the time that a train spends at a terminal, was down 23 percent to 22.2 hours in the first quarter of this year compared with 29 hours for the same period in 2018. NSC plans to focus its TOP 21 efforts on its general merchandise, unit train and automotive segments this year. After that, it will focus on intermodal. NSC executives said the company is watching how it can entice customers to ship via rail instead of truck, particularly in the intermodal segment. Norfolk Southern expects to see intermodal volumes grow, albeit at a slower place than 2018, amid improved service, a tight truck market and forecasted growth in consumer spending. We've been able to grow our intermodal franchise in tight truck conditions and in loose truck conditions. Right now, the truck market is not nearly as tight as it was last year, but it's still tighter than overall balance. And there is an inherent advantage to intermodal relative to truck in terms of cost structure, Norfolk Southern's chief marketing officer Alan Shaw said. The company reported record first quarter net profit of $677 million, a 23 percent increase from $552 million in the first quarter of 2018. Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this?

2019-05-01,"Hub Group Posts Record Per-Share Earnings In Quarter, Raises Full-Year Estimates","Hub Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HUBG) April 30 reported record earnings per-share in the first quarter of 71 cents, more than doubling year-earlier levels and well above analysts' estimates of 54 to 55 cents per share. Oak Brook, Ill.-based Hub also raised full-year earnings estimates to a range of $3.25 and $3.40 a share. Analysts surveyed by Barchart, a financial markets service, had forecast $3.21 a share. For the quarter, revenue rose 11 percent to $933 million, below estimates of $947 million of analysts polled on Yahoo Finance. Gross margins rose 40 percent year-over-year, with growth spread out across all four of its service lines, Hub said. Operating income rose 115 percent to $35.6 million, while operating margins increased to 3.8 percent, a 180 basis point increase, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based multi-modal provider said. Earnings per-share before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 83 percent to $64 million. Net income of $23.9 million was up nearly $8 million from the 2018 period. The 2018 quarter included $5.1 million in net income, or 15 cents per share, generated by Hub's sale of its former Mode Transportation, LLC unit, an agent-based operation which was sold in September 2018. This was Hub's first quarter to include the results from CaseStack, which Hub acquired in December 2018 in a $255 million all-cash deal to beef up its exposure to the less-than-truckload (LTL) consolidation and brokerage segments. Revenue for Hub's core intermodal segment rose 8 percent to $536 million as price increases more than offset a 1 percent decline in volume. Revenue for Hub's transcontinental and western businesses each rose 1 percent, while eastern revenue dipped 1 percent. Gross margins rose due to a more favorable pricing environment, Hub said. Hub executives said that rail volumes were hurt by the impact of a lingering winter in parts of the country, and by Midwest flooding that made it tough on Union Pacific Railroad Co. (NYSE:UNP), Hub's main western rail partner. Daily volumes in April were flat to slightly down, a continuation of the activity seen in March and a legacy of the inclement weather, Hub Chairman and CEO David P. Yeager said. Here in Chicago, we haven't ahd spring yet, Yeager told analysts. At the same time, Yeager noted that UP and Hub's Hub's eastern rail partner, Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC), have stepped up their operational games. In particular, Norfolk Southern's on-time performance improved dramatically as the quarter progressed, to the point where in the past week its service levels were the best Hub has seen in two years, Yeager said. As a result, Hub has raised its expectations for rail service for the balance of the year, he added. Logistics revenue rose 25 percent to $203 million, due in large part to the inclusion of CaseStack. Truck brokerage revenue fell 2 percent to $117 million as a 20 percent increase in loads brokered was offset by a 22 percent drop in price and mix due to the addition of CaseStack's LTL bias. Higher fuel prices also weighed, Hub said. Contract business accounted for 85 percent of total truckload volume, up from 80 percent in the first quarter of 2018. Dedicated revenue rose 26 percent to $76.1 million as new account growth and better pricing offset the impact of lost business, Hub said. Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this?

2019-05-13,"Rail Equipment Sector Eyes Mergers, Lease Renewal Rates","A number of rail equipment lessors and manufacturers have been merging and consolidating in recent months as a way to leverage themselves against marketplace changes brought about by precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operational model that seeks to cut costs. Among them, railcar manufacturer Greenbrier (NYSE:GBX) acquired the manufacturing segment of American Railcar Industries in April as a way for Greenbrier to solidify its role as a supplier of covered hoppers and tank cars. In February 2019, Wabtec's (NYSE:WAB) merged with GE Transportation to ramp up its market presence as a rail component manufacturer specializing in automation and locomotive upgrades, according to Matt Elkott, an analyst with investment firm Cowen. Meanwhile, Trinity Industries (NYSE:TRN) spun off its non-railcar business last year to focus on fleet growth, Elkott said. While PSR could eventually lead to a net reduction in railcars in service among the Class I railroads deploying the operational model, railcar lessors can still benefit in the post-PSR landscape by taking advantage of how the railroads replace and reorganize their fleets, Elkott said. Consolidation could benefit not just the participating parties but all other players. It could right-size production capacity in the face of tempered demand and improving rail velocity, freeing up capital by eliminating redundant resources, and boost the builders' pricing power, Elkott said in a May 9 research note. For instance, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) appears to be attempting to reduce the number of different types of boxcars in its fleet, with a possible eye towards deploying newer, higher capacity railcars that complement the company's PSR efforts, he said. Meanwhile, Wabtec said last month that its acquisition of GE Transportation will leverage Wabtec's efforts to market automation technologies to the railroads. We have combined Wabtec's freight and transit components with GE Transportation's locomotive manufacturing and service capabilities… So far, we're seeing a strong cultural fit, which is enabling a seamless combination of our businesses and could lead to fully automated operations in the Class I network, Wabtec chief executive officer Ray Betler said during his company's first quarter earnings call on April 25. Railcar utilization in 2019 One way to analyze how PSR will affect rail equipment and manufacturing is to look at data on railcar orders and the number of railcars in storage. But since NSC, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSC) have begun to implement elements of PSR only recently, more data over longer terms will be needed. Railcar orders and railcar utilization rates can also be affected by the same near-term factors affecting rail volumes, such as consumer demand and the general health of the U.S. economy. For now, Elkott estimates that railcar orders could fall 33 percent in 2019 to 39,739 orders amid tempered decline and buyers taking a wait-and-see approach this year as PSR takes hold. The decline is also partly attributable to one-off orders placed by lessors in 2018. But railcar orders could grow 21 percent between 2019 and 2020 to 48,200 orders. Both 2019 and 2020 estimates are below the 2005-2018 annual average of 59,800 units, he said. While railcar orders could soften this year, the number of railcars currently in storage could drop in 2019 as volumes pick up during the spring and summer, according to analyst Bascome Majors of the investment firm Susquehanna Financial Group. The number of railcars in storage fell in April 2019 for the first time in months, according to Majors' analysis of data from the Association of American Railroads. Railcars in storage declined 0.7 percent between March and April to 341,747 railcars. Of that, the number of open hoppers in storage fell 6.8 percent while covered hoppers fell 1.5 percent and flat cars fell 9 percent, Majors said. Railcars that saw their storage numbers increase in April included boxcars, whose storage rates grew 8.4 percent, an gondolas, which grew 2.9 percent. Storage rates also rose for intermodal wells, tank cars and refrigerator cars. Railcar utilization rose in April for the first time since October [2018], breaking a six-month negative streak, Majors said. One month does not a trend make, but we continue to see potential for utilization to rise [and storage to fall] this spring and summer as rail volumes recover out of winter, Majors said in a May 3 research note. Elkott agreed that railcar utilization could grow this year, despite his forecast for fewer railcar orders. I am actually modeling for orders to also improve in the remainder of the year compared to the relatively low level we saw in the first quarter, Elkott said. Trinity expects its renewal rate in 2019 for its leased railcar fleet to increase 13 percent from 2018. The company also said it is seeking to be a prudent and opportunistic buyer of railcars for the secondary market. The company also reaffirmed its support of PSR, saying the changes will enable the rail industry to compete long-term. While railroads usually reduce the number of railcars available apart in their new lines, this does not necessarily or directly translates into an increase in railcars and storage, Trinity commercial officer Eric Marchetto said. Instead, this exchange places more onus on the shippers to provide their own railcars, a great opportunity for a leasing company to fill this need.

2019-05-16,Canadian Rail Volumes Rise Again While U.S. Volumes Fall,"Canadian rail volumes rose again year-to-date for the week ended May 11, while U.S. rail volumes continued downward amid U.S. tariff uncertainty and a fuzzy economic picture. Freight rail operations in Canada have originated 2.84 million carloads and intermodal units year-to-date, a 2.4 percent increase from the same period in 2018, according to data published weekly by the Association of American Railroads. Of that total, Canadian rail operations moved 1.54 million carloads year-to-date, which is 2.7 percent more than the same period last year, and 1.3 million intermodal units, which is a 2 percent increase from a year ago. The carloads include the U.S. carloads of Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) and Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP). A 6.2 percent increase in grain carloads year-to-date, a 5.8 percent increase in coal and a 22.8 percent increase in petroleum and petroleum product carloads have helped lift Canadian carloads. So far this year, grain carloads have totaled 165,937, while coal totaled 147,921 and petroleum products totaled 178,902. Grain, coal and petroleum represented 10.8 percent, 9.6 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively, of Canadian carloads. Canadian rail volumes represent 21 percent of overall North American rail traffic. Meanwhile, U.S. rail volumes year-to-date dipped again, falling 2 percent to 9.83 million carloads and intermodal units. U.S. freight rail operations have originated 4.76 million carloads, a 2.4 percent drop compared with the same period in 2018, while intermodal units fell 1.7 percent to 5.07 million intermodal containers and trailers. U.S. rail volumes year-to-date represent about 74 percent of overall North American rail traffic. Rail executives still positive on economy but tariffs talk weighs Canadian rail executives and their U.S. counterparts at investor conferences this week affirmed their views that the North American economy was still growing, which could support volume growth as the year progresses. We haven't seen the effects of a negative macro[-economic] environment. The underlying macro environment is still pretty robust and broad-based across several commodities, said CPI chief financial officer Nadeem Velani at an investor conference this week. Velani pointed to his company's strong volumes for April. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) chief financial officer Cindy Earhart also said customers remain positive on the U.S. economy. Manufacturing indexes such as those from the Institute for Supply Management are still showing some economic expansion, Earhart said. But rail executives also noted that the tariff uncertainty between the U.S. and China is clouding the economic outlook for the remainder of the year, which could affect volumes, particularly for those with access to ports on the western U.S. and Canada, such as CP, CN and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP). We're not out of the woods of what [the tariffs] could mean but we're cautiously optimistic for the next six to nine months, Velani said. Canadian National chief financial officer Ghislain Houle told investors at another investor conference that tariff impacts would affect imports coming into the ports of Prince Rupert and Vancouver for goods bound for destinations in the middle of the U.S. Union Pacific chief financial officer Rob Knight told investors that the U.S. tariffs were a wildcard. Our confidence and guidance remains unchanged [but]…The tariff issue, the temperature on that one is certainly up rather than cooling down and is a factor that could impact volumes, Knight said. Meanwhile, even though rail executives said they were still confident about the U.S. economy, a FreightWaves' analysis of economic indicators for April shows that the economy could still be trying to find its way. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau showed a 0.2 percent drop in retail sales from March to April, with year-to-date growth down 3.1 percent. Manufacturing production fell 0.5 percent between March and April, with year-over-year growth below 1 percent for the first time since early 2017. Image sourced from Pixabay"
2019-05-16,Eastern U.S. Railroads Eye Foothold In E-Commerce,"Executives with eastern railroads CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) expressed confidence this week that they can compete alongside trucks for e-commerce business. As customers such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) explore the possibility of foregoing the middle man in favor of interacting more directly with the railroads, CSX will go along with the change, according to CSX chief executive officer Jim Foote at a May 15 investor conference sponsored by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Transportation is a huge spend for those companies. Reliability is a huge factor with how they compete in the marketplace, Foote said. We'll evolve and the industry will evolve…we're getting to the point where we can be players in the e-commerce market because our reliability and our service is to the point where it meets industry standards, Foote said. Both CSX and NSC also said their relationships with their channel partners are long-term, and as a result, shield them from changes in spot pricing in the truck market. CSX and NSC tend to have shorter lengths of haul compared with their western U.S. counterparts because of the geography of the eastern U.S. rail network. That shorter length of haul also means that they can find themselves competing with trucks for business. CSX pays more attention to the long-term trends that could affect the trucking market, such as the impending driver shortage and the mandate requiring electronic logging devices, Foote said. Because of CSX's long-term relationships with its channel partners, the company isn't as exposed to spot truck pricing as an LTL would be, he said. If you look at those macro issues, it's still a very positive environment for intermodal, Foote said. CSX's unwinding of its former intermodal strategy, which entailed linking together short-haul moves at intermediate terminals to create long-haul moves, is mostly done, with many of those operational changes for intermodal made in the fall of 2017, Foote said. CSX made those changes as part of its 2017 efforts to transition to precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operational model that seeks to lower costs and maximize assets. Meanwhile, CSX competitor NSC also said it was continuing to work with channel partners in relationships that could evolve over time as the railroads seek to maintain a foothold in offering transportation options to e-commerce players. We are still very much close with our channel partners, NSC chief financial officer Cindy Earhart said. Norfolk Southern has also been pruning some of its intermodal lanes, resulting in lane changes in February and April, Earhart said. The company in the fall of 2018 announced plans to transition to PSR in several stages, starting in early 2019. It's an ongoing process to look at the lanes and gauge their profitability and see whether they're meeting customers' expectations, she said. Image sourced from Pixabay"
2019-05-20,"Railroad's Shift To PSR Model Puts Storage, Railcar Onus On Shippers","For years, shippers have tapped spare capacity of railcars and tracks as a low-cost option for storing and staging bulk commodities. But the widespread adoption of the business model known as precision scheduled railroading means the big U.S. railroads want to be in the moving business, not the storage business. And that poses a problem for the hundreds of shippers now looking where to store their tanker cars, hoppers, and gondolas. The number of railcars in storage was just slightly above 311,000 at the start of May, this is a marginal increase from last years average of 300,000 cars in storage, says Martin Lew, Chief Executive Officer of rail car storage, leasing and purchasing marketplace Commtrex. Once you get above 300,000 idled cars, you're talking about roughly 20 percent of the 1.67 million railcars in the North American fleet of the available railcar capacity, which is an increase the last years average of 312,000 cars in storage. Lew said. Commtrex's platform helps rail shippers navigate this new market. The Sugar Land, Texas-based company lists 143,000 storage spaces for rail cars, along with over $520 million in railcars in the Commtrex system and more than 1,500 transloading locations. We've seen more activity in our storage module the last six months than we have seen across the past two years, which can be construed as a negative indicator for overall railcar demand, he added. Commtrex's pricing index data, available as the new Railcar Storage Price index (SONAR: RCSP), shows the level of demand across different geographies. The storage index for U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic states (SONAR: RCSP.NASE) is up 31 percent since the end of February. But Gulf Coast storage (SONAR: RCSP.NACE) have come off their March and April highs. (Source: SONAR, data courtesy of Commtrex) Storage levels continue to increase across all car types. But the largest increases are in covered hoppers, which handle grains, chemicals, non-metallic minerals, and tank cars, which handle liquid bulk. Both assets account for two-thirds of all railcars in storage, Lew said. About 18 percent of North America's fleet of about 571,800 covered hoppers is in storage, according to Commtrex. For tank cars, about 22 percent of the North American fleet of roughly 431,200 tank cars is in storage. Lew said the high number of railcars in storage indicates slowing activity among major commodity producers and buyers and the overall freight slowdown. Likewise, it can reflect commodity specific issues. For example, oil drillers in the Permian oil basin in West Texas have switched away from using white sand sourced in Wisconsin for hydraulic fracturing. In its place, they are using in-basin sand from the Permian itself, which now represents nearly a quarter of the total supply of the market. That, of course, reduces demand for covered hoppers. But the main issue facing shippers is that flexible storage policies are becoming a thing of the past due to PSR. Railroads are selling off underutilized yards and they are starting to charge shippers higher penalties for keeping railcars idle. A major part of PSR is making sure that there are no idle cars sitting on the class 1 lines, Lew said. With a much higher focus on improving overall productivity by reducing the numbers of cars idle on class 1 lines in order to free capacity, increase fluidity while also decreasing dwell time, PSR is forcing their shippers to look for storage on the on their own. The issue of storage is of increasing concern to rail shippers. This week, the U.S. Surface Transportation Board will start hearings on the detention and demurrage fees hitting rail shippers. Last year, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) hiked demurrage fees for various classes of idled railcars from 25 percent to 40 percent. CSX Vice President Mark Wallace said on the company's last earnings call that the fees are incentivizing shippers to keep railcars in motion, and boosting CSX's efficiency. Our customers aren't holding onto our cars and they're spinning them faster and we're getting better asset utilization, Wallace said. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) is also reportedly looking at hiking its demurrage fees as it implements its own PSR plan through their clean sheeting initiative. In addition to tighter storage policies, PSR is also shifting the burden of railcar ownership to shippers. The number of cars that CSX had online in the first quarter 2019 dropped 10 percent from a year earlier. PSR is changing the dynamic for how much responsibility the shipper has over their own fleet which is now forcing many shippers that leaned on system leased cars to now having to secure their own private fleet, Lew said. Lew said new storage sites are cropping up from railyards divested by the Class 1 railroads. That's creating something of a scramble among investors to acquire and assemble rail assets that can be re-purposed in the PSR world. We're seeing a lot of activity from investor groups and private equity firms that are looking to acquire short-line railroads and storage yards, Lew said. If you look at any deals for repair shops or short-lines, there are double-digit multiples being attached. Just by the virtue of PSR, you are going to have tens of thousands of cars typically on a Class 1 track now being told, ‘to find a home for storing cars that are not moving on our lines', Lew said.

2019-05-30,Positive Train Control Interoperability Still Far From A Reality,"Only 17 percent of the relationships between the U.S. passenger and freight railroads required to utilize positive train control (PTC) technology have interoperability, meaning that the host railroad can communicate with a non-host train through the technology, according to data released by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). The FRA has been tracking the implementation progress of PTC, a mandated technology that enables railroads to keep track of the trains on their networks as a way to prevent accidents and collisions. The Class I railroads, Amtrak, commuter rail lines and a few other railroads must install the technology on the infrastructure of their main lines as well as on the trains themselves. The FRA publishes a quarterly implementation status update so that the railroads can keep up with fully installing PTC on their networks before the mandated deadline of December 31, 2020. The most recent update that outlines implementation progress through the end of the first quarter is available here. A total of 41 railroads must comply with the mandate, which Congress implemented as part of the Rail Safety Act of 2008. Besides installing the technology in their networks, the railroads must ensure that PTC enables interoperability, or the ability of a PTC-equipped train to send and receive signals on another company's network. The host railroad network must also have the ability to send and receive signals from trains that don't belong to the host railroad. As of the first quarter that ended on March 31, 38 of the 227 relationships, or 17 percent, between host and tenant railroads required to have PTC achieved interoperability. A tenant railroad is a company that has a train running on a host railroad's track or property. The Class I rail network that is required to have PTC is 16 percent interoperable with tenant railroads, as of the end of the first quarter. BNSF's PTC-enabled network is 33 percent interoperable, while Union Pacific's (NYSE:UNP) network is 23 percent interoperable and CSX's (NYSE:CSX) is 24 percent interoperable. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) and the U.S. operations of Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) and Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) have yet to achieve interoperability on their PTC-enabled networks. All four are listed at zero percent as of March 31, although 100 percent of their locomotives and track have the technology installed. Meanwhile, 29 percent of the commuter rail network is interoperable. Amtrak's network has 19 percent interoperability. Details on interoperability are available here. While interoperability is one element that constitutes the successful implementation and deployment of PTC, there are other steps as well, according to the FRA. The railroads must conduct field testing, known as revenue service demonstration, of uncertified PTC systems on the general rail network; submit a PTC safety plan to the FRA, with host railroads also required to obtain PTC system certification; and activate the PTC so that it governs all operations on the required main lines, the FRA said. Looking at the overall network, PTC systems were in operation on almost 48,050 of the nearly 58,000 route miles affected by the mandate as of Match 31, the FRA said. This is a 3 percent increase from the fourth quarter of 2018. Conducting field tests and ensuring interoperability are among the next steps towards full integration. Image sourced from Pixabay"
2019-06-03,Port Report: Savannah Looks To Be New Gateway Into The Midwest,"The Port of Savannah aims to boost its market share of freight moving into the U.S. Midwest, saying it offers a cheaper way into the Gateway of the West than the West Coast gateways. To that end, the Georgia Ports Authority (GPA) said on May 31 that it is forming a partnership with the St. Louis Regional Freightway, a group aiming to promote Midwest logistics hubs, to develop unit train service between Savannah and St. Louis. Anheuser-Busch InBev (NYSE:BUD) and Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) are among the shippers represented at the St. Louis Regional Freightway. The partnership comes as the first part of the Mason Mega Rail Terminal is slated to come online by the end of 2019. Once complete, the project will double intermodal capacity out of Savannah's Garden City marine terminal to 1 million containers annually. Mega Rail will give CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) the ability to build 10,000-foot long unit trains. Each unit train is capable of carrying 360 forty-foot containers. Mega Rail is part of a larger $2.5 billion project that will bring Savannah's total container handling capacity to 8 million twenty foot equivalent (TEU) containers, up from current capacity of 5.5 million TEU, over the next decade. John Trent, who directs operations for GPA, said both CSX and Norfolk Southern route cargo to the Midwest through Savannah and have double-stack train service. But current volumes do not merit a unit train at this time. That is the purpose of this partnership, to develop a low-cost and competitive service using the Savannah intermodal gateway. At stake is the large amount of discretionary cargo that can move through any port. Most of the volumes moving into the U.S. Midwest are still coming through West Coast ports, and hauled inland by BNSF or Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP). Trent said a Savannah transit for an international container into the U.S. Midwest could save between $300 and $400 per container compared to intermodal service from West Coast ports. The transit time would roughly be the same. Ocean shipping would take between four and six days longer to Savannah than to the West Coast. But GPA officials have said the Midwest would be a one-day rail trip compared to a three- or four-day trip from the West Coast. Trent said the gateways being used by shippers now are experiencing issues related to volume and with our hyper-productive terminal services, rail miles to St. Louis, and reliability, we are positioned to provide the steamship lines and beneficial cargo owners with an excellent alternative. More shippers appear to be tapping Savannah to bring in their containers. Year-to-date imports at Savannah are up some 11 percent at 721,298 TEU. (Source: GPA) Despite the overall slowdown in intermodal freight, the intra-Southeast region saw the best growth in the first quarter, according to the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA). The Southeast saw intermodal volumes rise 8.7 percent compared with a year ago. International container volume showed an even bigger gain of 16 percent, offsetting declines in domestic and trailer volumes. The Midwest-Southwest intermodal lane, in contrast, saw volume fall 5 percent in the first quarter, with international container volume showing the biggest drop. IANA said some of the decline may be related to imported freight remaining in warehouses as well as weather-related issues hitting Midwest rail networks.

2019-06-06,May U.S. Intermodal Volumes Drop 5.9 Percent,"U.S. intermodal volumes fell 5.9 percent in May, while carloads fell 2.1 percent amid economic uneasiness and uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade between Mexico and China. U.S. railroads originated 1.3 million containers and trailers in May, down 5.9 percent from May 2018, according to the Association of American Railroads. Meanwhile, U.S. carloads fell 2.1 percent to 1.3 million carloads for that same time period. Combined, May intermodal and carload volumes slumped 4.1 percent to 2.6 million from May 2018. The current weakness in the rail traffic numbers is due to a combination of factors, said John Gray, AAR senior vice president of policy and economics. These include flooding in the Midwest that's been hindering the operations of railroads and many of their customers. More important is heightened economic uncertainty that's being made worse by increased trade-related tensions; higher tariffs leading to reductions or disruptions of international trade, and lower industrial output. In addition, some rail markets are undergoing rapid change. For example, locally sourced frac sand in Texas is displacing sand that used to be shipped in by rail. Just by themselves, these reduced sand movements are having a material negative impact on total rail carloads, Gray said. Year-to-date, U.S. rail volumes totaled nearly 11.4 million caloads and intermodal units for the week ending June 1, down 2.4 percent from the same period in 2018. U.S. carloads fell 2.4 percent to 5.5 million carloads. U.S. intermodal units also fell 2.4 percent to 5.8 million containers and trailers. While trade and economic uncertainties continue to loom as the second half of the year approaches in July, U.S. railroads anticipate rail volumes to rise in the third and fourth quarters, in part because of better weather. Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) lines in Kansas City are underwater, NSC chief executive officer Jim Squires said on June 5 at the UBS Global Industrials and Transportation conference. Norfolk Southern said in a June 4 advisory note that it continues to experience service disruptions between Decatur, Illinois, and Kansas City, Missouri, due to flooding of the Mississippi and Grand Rivers. With forecasts calling for even more rain in the days ahead, the railroad was unable to give an estimate for when service might be restored. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) told customers in a June 3 note that heavy rainfall and flooding continue to impact operations in Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri and Arkansas, resulting in new, prolonged and expanded subdivision outages.

2019-06-06,Railroads Discuss Hedging Against Market Uncertainty,"Uncertainty about why U.S. rail volumes are down, competition with the truck market and potential mergers and acquisitions were among the themes explored at two investor conferences this week. Here are just a few highlights: Kansas City Southern Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSC) is seeing more volumes move from Mexico ahead of the U.S. deadline to impose import tariffs on Mexican goods, said Jeff Songer, chief operating officer. We're seeing a push of volumes ahead of June 10, with more finished autos moving north from Mexico to the U.S., Songer said at the Deutsche Bank Global Industrials and Materials Summit on June 5. Forty-one percent of the railroad's volumes are cross-border, and about 16 percent of KSC's total carload volumes could be affected should the U.S. start to implement the tariff that U.S. President Donald Trump proposed on May 30 as a way to force Mexico to respond more forcefully against illegal immigration. If the U.S. puts a 5 percent tariff on Mexican imports, Songer calculated that about 5 percent can be absorbed by the supply chain. But if the tariff increases as it is scheduled to do in the upcoming summer months, we'll have some diligence to do, Songer said. Looking at performance indicators, Songer said KSC started running 6,000-foot trains in May, which was one of the company's operational goals for 2019. The railroad is also nearing its terminal dwell goal of 21 hours for 2019. Year-to-date terminal dwell is 21.6 hours, down from 23.1 hours for the same period in 2018. CSX The trend of big companies like WalMart Inc (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) seeking more control of their supply chain is likely to continue, CSX (NYSE:CSX) chief executive officer Jim Foote said at the Deutsche Bank investor summit. Is there discussion in the marketplace that some companies are moving to a direct interface with the rails? I think that's just a natural evolution, Foote said. When someone gets big enough, they don't need the middleman or they want a different kind of relationship. I think this is just a natural evolution and we'll see how it plays out, he added. As to why U.S. rail volumes have been down so far this year compared with 2018, Foote pointed to stronger volumes in 2018, which is resulting in weaker year-over-year comparisons. But he also said market uncertainty is a factor, despite business being as usual with CSX's customers. Customers haven't pulled back on capital projects, for example. Trade, the weather, and all kinds of external factors are an issue, but more so an issue in terms of visibility. There is and has been a whole lot of noise for the first five months of the year, in trying to get a sense of why we are slightly below [where we] expected them to be, Foote said at the UBS Global Industrials and Transportation conference on June 6. Meanwhile, devastating weather in the Midwest has compounded that uncertainty, he said. It's just a confusing time for all of us in transportation and anybody in manufacturing or business in general to have a really good sense of why we're seeing this kind of softness, Foote said. U.S. tariffs on imports of certain goods from China have actually benefited CSX's traffic volumes because the tariffs have spurred increased production of domestic coal, steel and iron ore, Foote said. Meanwhile, CSX has been demarketing lanes tied to a short-haul regional intermodal strategy that it deployed pre-PSR, constituting a 15 percent loss in intermodal volumes since late 2017, Foote said. As a result, CSX's intermodal volumes have been trending lower overall, he said. Norfolk Southern Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) has begun initial roll out of the next phase of its precision scheduled railroading program, but it will fully turn on the TOP21 program on July 1, chief executive officer Jim Squires said at the UBS conference on June 5. The railroad is seeking to improve network fluidity and velocity, reduce circuity and have fewer train starts and crew starts as a result of TOP21. It began developing the TOP21 program last year using computer modeling and simulation tools to analyze data and train flows, the company has said. Norfolk Southern will have one big network cutover to switch to this next phase, Squires said. This phase will focus on the railroad's general merchandise market. Norfolk Southern has turned on a few locations, such as Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to test out the system. Once TOP 21 is fully in place, nodes like Harrisburg will see heavier volumes passing through. When asked about the competing truck market, Squires said Norfolk Southern has contract business with channel partners, and so it is less exposed to the spot market for trucks. Channel partners though are more exposed to the spot truck market, which has been loose, and so NSC's partners are hoping for the spot market to tighten in the second half, he said. Canadian Pacific Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) chief financial officer Nadeem Velani said consolidation between the North American railroads could still happen, particularly as almost all the railroads have implemented some form of precision scheduled railroading. We've been vocal advocates for consolidation, Velani said at the Deutsche Bank investor summit. Running two networks as one could result in greater capacity and better service for customers. As demographics change and the highways become more congested, two railroads could consolidate as a way to become an even more attractive shipping option, Velani said. Consolidation would allow railroads to increase capacity with limited investment, he said. One day, it will be the right thing to do from a North American transportation system point of view, although whether it will occur two years or five years or 10 years from now remains to be seen, Velani said. Consolidation also comes from weakness or from when a railroad might be struggling, and right now, it's not that point in time, Velani said. Canadian National Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) expects operational cost savings of C$200 million to $400 million over the next three years in large part because of how it will be deploying technology. Technological tools, such as those to help with track inspection, can result in lower maintenance costs over time and enable CNI to be more predictive than reactive in addressing safety and maintenance issues, said Keith Reardon, senior vice president of the consumer product supply chain. The railroad also expects to reduce operational costs through efforts to bring more new, fuel-efficient locomotives online and return leased locomotives, which are less fuel efficient, Reardon said at the Deutsche Bank conference. Investing in technology is one of three elements in its capital strategy. Another is investing in infrastructure, such as enabling containers to move faster through ports, and the third is a feed-the-beast play consisting of potential mergers and acquisitions of short line railroads or intermodal or trucking assets, according to Paul Harridine, vice president of procurement and supply management. When asked whether large shippers work with CNI directly instead of with intermodal marketing companies, Reardon said CNI has two supply channels, one for retail and the other for wholesale to beneficial cargo owner. This division is not new to us. It's been very successful for us and we'll continue down that path, Reardon said. As there are ebbs and flows in capacity, we can smooth our risks on the upside and downside with those two channels. Union Pacific Bad weather has dampened Union Pacific's (NYSE:UNP) second quarter volumes, which are down 3 percent so far compared with the same period in 2018. Flooding is impacting routes in Kansas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, and the railroad has put some embargoes in place, with some of that affecting intermodal business, according to Jennifer Hamann, senior vice president of finance. The railroad is expecting volumes to improve in the second half of 2019, in part because of favorable comparisons between 2018 and 2019. Hamann said at the Deutsche Bank conference. Union Pacific is in the middle stages of implementing Unified Plan 2020, its version of precision scheduled railroading, and as a result, it is looking at additional terminal rationalizations and opportunities to consolidate assets such as intermodal facilities, locomotive shops and railcar facilities. There's really nothing that's off limits, Hamann said. Image sourced from Pixabay"

2019-06-13,U.S. Weekly Rail Traffic Slumps 8.5 Percent,"Flooding impacts, cheap natural gas prices, and trade and economic uncertainty could be factors contributing to a significant slump in weekly U.S. rail volume. U.S. rail volumes fell 8.5 percent to 513,099 carloands and intermodal units for the week that ended on June 8, according to the Association of American Railroads. Of that U.S. rail operations originated 9.1 percent fewer carloads compared with the same week in 2018, with volume at 246,758 carloads. U.S. rail operations also originated 266,341 intermodal containers and trailers, down 8 percent from the same period a year ago. The biggest losers in carload volume for the week include coal, which slumped 15.9 percent, non-metallic minerals, which dropped 13.9 percent, and motor vehicles and parts, which fell 12.9 percent. Coal, non-metallic minerals and motor vehicles and parts represented 29 percent, 14 percent and 6.4 percent, respectively, of total U.S. carload volume for the week. On a year-to-date basis, U.S. rail volumes fell 2.7 percent to 11.9 million carloads and intermodal units. Of that, U.S. carloads and U.S. intermodal units were also both down 2.7 percent. U.S. carloads totaled 5.8 million carloads while U.S. intermodal units totaled 6.1 million containers and trailers. Source: Association of American Railroads The drop in U.S. rail volumes could be a result of several factors. Continued flooding in the Midwest is resulting not only in submerged rail track but is also causing barges to stall on the Mississippi River. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) said in a June 8 service notice that it expects the route to Kansas City to be out of service through at least the middle of June because of flooding on the Mississippi and Grand rivers. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) said conditions have improved in the Midwest, but it is still facing outages in Missouri. The railroad is also monitoring river conditions along the Missouri River in Missouri and Kansas and the Arkansas River near Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Mother Nature struck her heavy hand again, this time to our Heartland Service Unit in our Southern Region – bringing severe flooding throughout Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas and impacting one of our key North-South corridors, said Kenny Rocker, UNP senior vice president of sales and marketing, in a June 12 customer note. At any given time during the last week of May, we had up to eight subdivisions impacted by flooding. Meanwhile, natural gas prices have fallen, with Henry Hub spot prices hovering around $2.40/mmBtu, and that drop puts pressure on coal demand. When gas prices are low, utilities opt to utilize their gas-fired plants to produce the electricity that helps power air conditioners. And then, there's the economy and trade uncertainty. Although the U.S. President Donald Trump stepped away from imposing an import tariff on goods from Mexico, the U.S. and China still haven't resolved their trade war. As for the U.S. economy, analyses of the latest jobs figures and construction and lumber demand indicate conditions that could hasten a slowdown in freight movements for some sectors.

2019-06-17,"Is The Death Of Rail-Hauled Coal True, Or Premature?","FreightWaves features Market Voices – a forum for market experts with unique knowledge from numerous transportation sectors and other critical expertise. Coal is fundamentally sedimentary rock that burns. Formed by the decomposition of plant matter, coal is a complex substance that is marketed in four classes – anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous and lignite. Elemental analysis gives empirical formulas such as C137H97O9NS for bituminous coal. For high-grade anthracite, the formula is likely C240H90O4NS. Anthracite coal is a hard, jet-black color rock. It contains between 86 percent and 98 percent carbon by weight and when burned it produces very little smoke. Anthracite coal was considered a premium home heating coal used throughout the northeastern United States into the early 1950s. Yes, I vaguely remember stocking an anthracite-fired furnace with my dad. Soft, or bituminous coal typically contains between 69 percent and 86 percent carbon by weight and is the most abundant form of coal. Sub-bituminous coal contains less carbon and more water. It is typically a less-efficient source of heat. Lignite coal, or brown coal, is soft coal that contains up to 70 percent water by weight. Coal deposits are often found in remote locations far from major population centers. In the ground, coal has a low marketplace utility value. Moving it to places of human use is what creates a higher value. Transportation of coal was first done by horse and wheeled wagons, then by water barge. The primary mode of transportation of coal for more than 100 years, though, has been by rail. Coal and railroads have been linked for more than 150 years It was the advent of railway lines and steam-powered locomotives that fueled the Industrial Revolution. Railroads, coal and sources of water in proximate locations were a natural market combination that powered the expansion of the U.S during the 19th and early 20th centuries. U.S. coal production between 1870 and 2015 Coal deposits and selected water springs allowed the Union Pacific Railroad (NYSE:UNP) and the Central Pacific Railroad to cross the great desert (treeless) frontier 150 years ago. Linking the two railroads created the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. With that introduction, let's evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of coal as a railroad business in the 21st century. After being mined and often resized in a crusher, then perhaps washed, most coal moves to markets by rail, using either high-side gondola cars or open-top hopper cars. Railcars filled with coal are emptied primarily in one of two ways. The coal is dumped using gravity, or it is dumped using rotary couplers that allow the freight car to be tipped over. Rotary couplers allow the car to be rotated (tipped) while still coupled to the cars on either side. Railcars with rotary couplers are clamped to the rails and then rotated/tipped about 135 degrees so that the coal comes out of the railcar. Often there is a railcar shaker that is part of the dump mechanism. A BNSF railcar with rotary couplings. How big is the railway coal freight business? It comprises about 14 percent of total U.S. rail freight carloads. But that volume has been shrinking since 2008 at about 25 percent year-over-year. The long-term shows a negative slope. However, month-to-month and year-to- year coal volumes by rail are up and down. The short-term demand pattern is irregular. During 2018, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) economic group cited just a 0.10 percent increase in coal carloads over 2017's totals. That represents an increase of fewer 6,000 carloads. As a comparison, the total of all commodities increased by 2.2 percent, and numerically by just under 392,000 units. Of that, crude oil and petroleum by rail increased approximately 20 percent, or by more than 176,000 carloads. For all of 2018, just over 4.8 million carloads of coal were moved. That's about 13,000 to 15,000 railcars loaded daily. Out along the main line tracks, U.S. coal trains are very long. Out west, coal trains average 130 or more loaded cars. That's more than 12,000 net short tons per train. On a tonnage basis, the AAR reports that coal accounts for close to one-third of the entire U.S. rail tons (1.6+ billion tons) of all commodities and goods ‘originated' by Class 1 railroads. Information courtesy of American Association of Railroads Coal is still an excellent gross revenue business sector for the railroads. On average, shippers pay U.S. railroads more than $2,000 per loaded railcar to get the coal delivered to utilities and other key destinations. That totals about $10 billion to move coal, which is about 15 percent of total U.S. gross railway company revenue. Coal used to be the most profitable rail freight segment depending upon how your rail costing systems measure railroad profits. Five decades ago, a few eastern railroad companies like the Norfolk & Western Railway ((now part of Norfolk Southern Railroad , NYSE:NSC)) might have earned more than two-thirds of their entire profits from the coal business. Hauling chemicals, boxcars and intermodal was incremental gravy, but not strategically essential to their business plan. That's no longer the case. Chemicals are now the most profitable rail freight commodity market segment. Over the past three decades it became clear to senior rail managers of the older coal-based rail companies that future business prospects required a more diversified commodity mix than just black gold coal. Replacing coal with an expanded mixed carload and intermodal service network was part of the Norfolk Southern and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) railroads strategic planning that then resulted in the split-acquisition of Conrail's industrial rail network. Market geography of U.S. rail-moved coal Since about 1988, the Powder River Basin (PRB) area of eastern Wyoming and south central Montana has been the nation's largest mining region. That one area accounts for more than 45 percent of all U.S. electric-generating coal. Why? The Clean Air Act of 1970 created a surge in demand for coal out of the PRB region. Before those air pollution regulations, Wyoming coal production never exceeded 20 million annual tons. That region came to dominate domestic rail-originated coal. Data courtesy of U.S. Energy Information Administration However, it is clear from numerous sources, including a 2019 report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), that there has been confirmation of what many economists believed. The title of the report says it all – Powder River Basin Coal Industry Is in Long‑Term Decline. There might be unforeseen technology, energy price competition or geo-political changes that lead to renewed coal growth. But that reversal seems a reach. Need more evidence? Here is a closer look at the PRB coal market. Approximately 130 power stations in the U.S. bought PRB coal in 2018 – from just 16 PRB mines. A decade earlier that customer base was about 200 users, spread over 23 states. That's a significant decline of about 35 percent. Failure to find new markets will likely result in a slow reduction towards 300 million or fewer tons mined annually in the coming five years. Competition is an endless economic force. Is there an upside? Yes. Here are several possibilities. Global trade and or sub-regional war conflicts could favor some restoration of coal as a key source of energy. Energy and logistics companies have plans for as many as five ports in Washington and Oregon that could possibly sell and export PRB rail-hauled coal to Asia markets. However, the obstacles to those plans are western state environmental and safety regulations. Another upside is possible coal liquefaction. That is a process in which coal is dissolved in a solvent at high pressure and temperature followed by hydrogen treatment to create liquid fuel. The U.S. has proven coal reserves that could last 1,000 or more years if liquefaction technology and market demand commercially expands. Key players in market liquefaction include DKRW Energy, Envidity Energy Inc. and TransGas Development Systems. However, the timeline to large-scale production is uncertain. Would liquefaction require more rail coal movement? Or more tank car or pipeline movement? No one is sure. In closing, the long-term trend line slope for coal is down. The angle of the slope isn't yet certain. Unchanged, the pattern suggests lower coal demand and a market for building fewer coal railcars and coal train locomotives. Image sourced from Pixabay"
2019-06-19,U.S. Rail Volumes Are Still Falling,"U.S. rail volumes trended downward again for the week ending June 15, with weekly volumes falling over 5 percent and year-to-date volumes declining nearly 3 percent, according to the latest data from the Association of American Railroads. U.S. rail operations originated 527,989 carloads and intermodal units, down 5.4 percent from the same week in 2018. Of that, U.S. carloads totaled 257,385, down 4.6 percent, while intermodal containers and trailers fell 6.2 percent to 270,604. On a year-to-date basis, U.S. rail volumes fell 2.8 percent to 12.4 million carloads and intermodal units. Of that, U.S. rail operations originated 6 million carloads and 6.4 million intermodal containers and trailers. Both segments were also down 2.8 percent. The decline in U.S. rail volumes comes as the manufacturing sector still faces weakened export demand and lackluster business investment prospects. But gains in the retail sector in May, including an increase in retail spending for the third consecutive month, suggest the possibility that some sectors of the U.S. economy could be stabilizing. Meanwhile, flooding conditions in the Midwest continue to dampen rail volumes (see https://www.freightwaves.com/news/more-flooding-possible-barges-waiting-forecast-video for the latest update). The flooding has contributed to lower volumes for coal, which represents nearly one-third of weekly U.S. carload volume. BNSF said on June 14 that portions of its network in Iowa and Missouri were flooded, with four subdivisions partially or fully out of service because of high water, track damage or other flood-related issues. The rail company said last week that it couldn't provide an estimated date for when its Napier subdivision and three other subdivisions adjacent to the Mississippi River in Missouri would reopen. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) has restored service to and from Kansas City, although it warned of congestion and delays, according to a June 17 notice. Image Sourced From Pixabay"
2019-06-24,May U.S. Rail Employment Levels Dropped. Will They Keep Falling?,"Rail employment levels fell nearly 3 percent in May on a year-over-year basis amid the deployment of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operating model that seeks to streamline operations, at several of the Class I railroads. In May, the U.S. rail operations of Class I railroads employed 142,950 workers, which is 2.8 percent fewer than May 2018 but up 0.3 percent from April, according to data submitted to the Surface Transportation Board. Of that total, the number of train and engine employees fell to its lowest level since February 2018. The U.S. operations of the Class I railroads employed 60,256 train and engine workers in May, down 2.2 percent from May 2018 and 4.2 percent from April. The train and engine employee category can reflect the railroads' response to changes in rail volume levels, and U.S. rail volumes presently are lower this year than last year. Lower rail volumes and the deployment of PSR at Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) were among the factors contributing to the rail headcount decline. While softer than expected volumes to start 2019 have certainly enabled the rails to cut volume-sensitive staffing, successful PSR implementation and related efficiency gains (longer trains, less interim car handling) have enabled lower terminal and train operator headcount, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Bascome Majors said in a June 19 research note. Could rail employment levels drop even further? Headcount levels for all U.S.-based rail employees have been below the 150,000 level since January 2017. That decline is part of a longer-term trend. Just within the last five years, monthly employment levels busted the 170,000 level from December 2014 to July 2015, peaking at 174,122 in April 2015. But headcount totals have fallen since then. Should the Class I railroads see rail volumes sustainably increase, furloughed workers could be called back to meet network capacity needs, resulting in a bump up of headcount levels. But another factor that could affect headcount levels in the long-term is the deployment of automation technologies. The potential of automation technologies displacing rail workers has gotten the attention of some members of Congress, some of whom have expressed concerns that the railroads have cut employee levels too drastically as PSR takes hold. Eliminating the workforce…seems like a bad idea for the longevity of the national network, said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon) at a rail safety hearing held by the U.S. House Subcommittee Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials. DeFazio's remarks were directed both to the freight railroads and Amtrak, which is considering trimming its internal police force by as much as 20 percent. When asked whether technology could replace rail workers one day, Association of American Railroads president Ian Jefferies said he still saw a huge demand for workers. It's incumbent upon all of us at this table to figure out how to guide the rail workforce during any transition, Jefferies said, referring to fellow witnesses testifying at the hearing. The other witnesses were the leaders of the main railroad unions. It may require a change of roles at the end of the day…We are a fully collectively bargained industry. We're required to be at the table as the shape and look of the workforce evolves, Jefferies said. John Previsich, president of the SMART Transportation Division, said the unions were ready to work with the railroads as the industry transitions to utilizing technology even further. We have a history of bargaining with respect to technological movements, Previsich said, citing the industry evolution from steam locomotives to diesel locomotives. We're not luddites. We get it. The challenge is that, along the way, you don't want safety to be compromised by the lack of regulatory oversight. There is a minimum standard that must be maintained, Previsich said.

2019-06-27,U.S. Rail Volumes Continue To Drop,"Year-to-date U.S. rail volumes fell again amid a loosening truck market, receding floodwaters in the Midwest and overall economic uncertainty. The U.S. operations of the Class I railroads originated 12.9 million carloads and intermodal for the first 25 weeks of this year, down 2.9 percent from the same period in 2018, according to data from the Association of American Railroads (AAR). Of that, U.S. carloads fell 2.9 percent to 6.3 million carloads, while U.S. intermodal containers and trailers dropped 3 percent to 6.66 million intermodal units. On a weekly basis, U.S. rail traffic totaled 525,116 carloads and intermodal units for the week ending June 22. Of that, U.S. carloads fell 4 percent to 257,836 carloads, while U.S. intermodal units tumbled 7.5 percent to 267,280 containers and trailers. Competitive truck pricing and economic uncertainty might be affecting rail volumes, as are other factors, such as flooding in the Midwest. Locks have started to open on the Mississippi River, enabling grain exports to travel down to the Gulf Coast, but rail operations are still facing residual delays. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) said in a June 24 customer notice that some subdivisions might reopen by the week's end, but the railroad warned of continued potential delays. Meanwhile, the decision by eastern Class I railroads CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) to abandon some intermodal lanes could be impacting year-over-year comparisons, according to Jason Seidl, senior transportation analyst for investment firm Cowen. In a June 27 research note, Seidl also pointed out that the decline in overall rail traffic volumes might not provide the fullest picture of the rail market, since the Canadian railroads are posting higher volumes year-over-year, while sizeable declines for intermodal and non-metallic minerals reflect specific headwinds for those respective markets. As a result, the quarter-to-date volume decline may look worse than it is, Seidl said. AAR reported that year-to-date Canadian rail volume is 2.1 percent higher, at 3.76 million carloads and intermodal units. Canadian carloads are up 2.5 percent from the same period in 2018, at 2.05 million carloads, while Canadian intermodal trailers and containers are 1.5 percent higher, at 1.7 million units. Still, even though a competitive truck market might be weighing on rail volumes, the trucking and intermodal sectors are also subject to some of the same economic pressures as the rail market. Some transportation analysts have lowered their second quarter outlooks for trucking and intermodal companies, citing lackluster demand, bad weather and trade uncertainty. Image Sourced From Pixabay"
2019-07-08,"Morgan Stanley Cuts Transports Price Targets, Says Second-Derivative Trade Is On","This morning (July 8) Morgan Stanley's (NYSE:MS) transports equities analysts cut their 12-month price targets for most of the companies they cover, but said that following the release of second quarter earnings it may be time to invest in the cyclical stocks again. The analyst team, led by Ravi Shanker, expects second quarter results for transportation and logistics companies to be poor, and does not expend a meaningful rebound in the second half of the year. The first quarter's weakness was largely driven by weather, destocking and tariff concerns and many of those headwinds continued into the second quarter as well, together with underlying economic/demand weakness robbing momentum from what is a seasonally strong quarter for the group, Shanker wrote. The good news is that Shanker thinks that investors have overcorrected and are now too pessimistic on the sector. Morgan Stanley expects earnings misses from the majority of railroad stocks, except for Canadian Pacific, which has some project-related idiosyncratic volume growth, mixed calls for truckload stocks, mostly misses for less-than-truckload stocks, mostly misses for third-party logistics companies, and have expectations in-line with guidance from the parcel carriers. As transportation companies revise downward their guidance for earnings in the second half of 2019, Shanker expects their multiples to rise from current ‘trough' levels back to ‘midcycle' levels. Here's how it works – equities analysts use a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to determine how ‘expensive' a company's stock is. The ratio is simple, just the current price of a share divided by the expected earnings per share. The P/E ratio tells an investor how much she has to pay for a company's earnings, or how many years of expected earnings it takes to buy part of a company. As transportation companies guide downward, their expected earnings, the denominator in the ratio, will drop, bringing the P/E multiple upward. Shanker thinks that normalizing P/E multiples could be the trigger that will bring investors back into the transport sector. Transports are relatively out-of-favor as a group and we believe investors are waiting to appropriately time their entry into the cyclicals (particularly TLs/LTLs), Shanker wrote. Lowered FY19/20 estimates and continued solidity/improvement in TLFI/pricing data could be that catalyst in the coming weeks. If the TLFI – Morgan Stanley's proprietary Truckload Freight Index – does solidify, then investors may ‘call the bottom' and start buying again. That's what Shanker meant by writing the second-derivative trade is on – things are still bad, but the pace of the decline is slowing. The ‘first-derivative' would simply be a year-over-year comparison, such as the national average spot rate being down 20 percent year-over-year. The ‘second-derivative' would be the rate of change in that comparison, for example the fact that on June 3, the average spot rate was down 27 percent year-over-year and is thus gradually improving against its year-over-year comparison. By the time the trucking industry is back to positive year-over-year growth, Morgan Stanley is suggesting, it will be too late to buy the sector because growth will be priced in. But now that the second-derivative is looking better (comparisons are still negative but improving), investors could be willing to re-enter. Consequently, a lowered bar with consensus/guidance cuts could see oversold names – particularly TLs [truckload carriers] – rebound on 2Q results, as multiples start to normalize toward mid-cycle from trough levels, Shanker wrote. Shanker said his team lowered price targets across the transports sector by anywhere from 1 percent to 14 percent, with an average price target cut of 4 percent. J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT) took the biggest hit on a percentage basis, sliding from a $95 price target to $88. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) dropped from $138 to $130; C.H. Robinson (NASDAQ:CHRW) and Echo Global Logistics (NASDAQ:ECHO) both saw their price targets cut by $2, to $65 and $23, respectively. On those asset-light freight brokerages, Shanker said that weaker volumes and intensifying competition will offset the favorable spread between contract and spot pricing, which has held brokerages' costs below their prices. We expect misses at all the brokers – spot vs. contract spread remains positive (at similar levels to 1Q) but will be offset by weaker volumes and more competition from new players resulting in negative pricing, Shanker wrote.

2019-07-08,Commentary: The Future Of Railway-Hauled Scrap Metals,"The future of railway-hauled scrap metals is profitable but slowly declining. FreightWaves features Market Voices – a forum for voices with unique knowledge of numerous transportation/logistics/supply chain sectors, as well as other critical expertise. Scrap recycling is an essential logistics business. It is gradually becoming part of the reverse supply chain as more states look for manufacturers to follow their goods from birth to death. Technically, scrap metal is the combination of waste metal or metallic material that is capable of being recycled from previous consumption or product use. FreightWaves SONAR In both the transportation and the reclamation business worlds, there are two basic categories of scrap metal – ferrous metal and non-ferrous metal. Ferrous metal contains some percentage of iron. Non-ferrous metal does not contain iron as a component. Non-ferrous scrap would include aluminum, copper, lead, nickel and others. Most of this report deals with the ferrous metal scrap business. For shippers and receivers (railroad customers), the scrap business is profitable. One source reported that during 2015, the U.S. ferrous scrap industry was worth $18.3 billion. FreightWaves SONAR The business of moving scrap isn't glamorous. It's frankly dirty. The business objective is to recycle used goods as cheaply as possible. That's the manufacturers' and reclaimers' point of view. The railroads want it to be profitable. And into 2019, it is profitable for the railroads. To move the scrap, railroads typically use a fleet of gondola railcars. The gondola railcars have a low center of gravity and are about 52- to 65-feet long. The length of railcar used depends upon the track and loading conditions of the customer facilities. Scrap geography In the U.S. market, scrap is concentrated in locations that will both produce it and process it – which are mostly east of the Mississippi River. Scrap that is collected in the West is usually exported to Asia (mainly China). In the eastern U.S. both CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) move large volumes of scrap metal. As one example, Norfolk Southern advertises its role in serving more than 20 eastern states with its fleet of over 20,000 railway cars (freight wagons to most of the world) dedicated to the movement of both metals and other construction industry materials. Norfolk Southern trains directly serve: 37 integrated and mini steel mills 70 transload facilities 150 scrap metal processing facilities CSX reports that about 87 percent of the nation's steel is produced within the market footprint of its service network. The core of that steel network lies within the Illinois – Indiana – Ohio region and along the East Coast. The customer's point-of-view Recycling of steel is a worthwhile economic business. One estimate suggests that that the recycling of one ton of steel can avoid the use of 2,500 pounds of iron ore, 1,400 pounds of coal and 120 pounds of limestone in making new steel. Recycling Today states that from the shipper's point of view, there are two daily business challenges. One is to obtain empty cars for loading. The other is to obtain a consistent pattern of empty cars delivered for loading on the days promised. Here is the perspective of a large ferrous scrap shipper. David J. Joseph Company (DJJ) is a NUCOR subsidiary that does almost $300 million a year in railroad scrap business. DJJ operates 13 scrap metal brokerages. It operates 50 recycling yards with 15 auto-shredding facilities. This is not a small business. One source reports that DJJ is a $2 billion asset firm. For smaller independent scrap brokers, the key to using rail is to assemble a large volume for movements that are typically 150 or more miles distance to a steel center or export port – thus beating the trucking costs. How does the scrap market work? Based upon personal observations, plus evidence gained from current business intelligence research, there is no sophisticated formal exchange market for pricing or arranging for scrap steel exchanges. There is certainly broad area scrap price information. But there is no scrap futures market. The scrap market tends to be a cash business when its transacted. Sales of scrap often reflect volatile short-term price moves. Prices reflect both volume available at a location and the quality of the segregated and sized scrap piles to be transported. Market prices can often be described as 30-day contracts. Transactions for scrap tend to be subjective as to terms. As to market pricing, two regions determine the initial transaction prices long before a railway car gets loaded: China for U.S. West Coast scrap; and Turkey for U.S. East Coast scrap. Domestic steel manufacturing market demand and market size no longer seem to be the principal drivers for scrap pricing. Instead, over the past two decades, the export market started to play a significant price-setting role. The highest export scrap pricing occurred in the period 2010-2011 – and then the global market fell dramatically in the 2012 to early 2015 period. This corresponded to a drip in demand for U.S.-produced steel. U. S. scrap steel prices fell – sometimes by 50 percent or more. The promises seen two decades ago of a large and continuing export scrap market hasn't returned yet. As exported scrap volume declined, scrap used to charge U.S. domestic steel mill furnaces hasn't recovered to its previous market highs. U.S. steel manufacturing capacity utilization rates in the 75 percent to 90 percent+ range fell in 2009 to less than 50 percent – and after a brief two-year recovery period back towards 80 percent utilization, then fell in a consistent downward slope back to less than 70 percent by 2017. The cumulative impact has resulted is extreme volatility in the market price of scrap as seen below. What is the current outlook for U.S. rail hauled scrap? At best it is tenuous. At worst, it is highly questionable as a growth market. Why questionable? Beyond 2019 geo-politics are fundamental challenges as steel and its scrap feedstock both face threats from source competition and product substitution. The source competition comes as over time the expansion of China's own durable and consumable steel products for goods like automobiles will see China's mills increasingly sourced by nearby domestic scrapping. Imports of scrap will continue, but the percentage of imports to local Chinese scrap will change. However, the largest scrap steel market threat may come from chemical-based product substitution of plastics and from emerging ceramics and composite materials. As substitute materials are used more extensively, many economists see a significant drop in the Chinese steel consumption per capita from today's high of ~500 kilograms. Strategically, previous projections for a huge increase in China's per capita steel consumption were based primarily on the growth pattern seen between the 1990s and the 2012 period. That was when China's GDP increase was in the double-digit range. It is time to reconsider those previous outlooks. Impact on railway scrap business? The resulting outlook for U.S. railway scrap steel is therefore one of low growth for a period – followed by a gradual volume reduction. To be sure, that is not a projected elimination of steel or scrap metals rail traffic. Shifting market demand for ferrous scrap should lower gondola freight car replacement orders in the decade ahead. Railroads won't order replacement gondolas as long as scrap prices remain low. Over the next two decades, both railroad volume and scrap sector volume derived revenues should also start to fall. As always, FreightWaves encourages discussion of counter arguments.

2019-07-12,Second Quarter Headwinds Temper Expectations For Rail,"As the Class I railroads begin reporting their second quarter earnings results next week, some members of the Wall Street community expect the lower rail volumes from the second quarter to affect the railroads' financial results. We believe volume, mix and continued weather challenges – particularly in the West – could be drags on results across the U.S. rails in the second quarter, Morgan Stanley transportation equities analysts said in a July 8 research note. Year-to-date U.S. rail volumes are down 3.2 percent, according to the latest data compiled by the Association of American Railroads. While flooding impacts in the Midwest in the second quarter could affect the earnings outlook for Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), the drop in U.S. intermodal volumes could dampen the outlook for CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). The uncertainty of whether the U.S. would place additional tariffs on China in the second quarter might have also had an impact on rail volumes in the second quarter, analysts said. All these factors have led some Wall Street investment firms to lower their expectations for second quarter results. Susquehanna Financial Group lowered its earnings per share estimates for all the publicly traded Class I railroads except Canadian Pacifc (NYSE:CP). The second quarter of 2019 was the deepest quarter of demand disappointment against our rail volume expectations that we can recall, at least since 2016. While intermodal weakness led, demand downside was surprisingly broad-based across commodities and rails (in-line CP the notable exception), said Bascome Majors, the group's transportation analyst. Despite lowered volume expectations, some Wall Street analysts anticipate that service metrics that have improved as a result of precision scheduled railroading (PSR) could help support rail volumes in the second half of the year. PSR is an operating model that stresses streamlining operations, and as a result, dwell times have fallen and velocity has largely improved for the railroads that deploy it. Volume declines in the second quarter were also seen across the transportation modes, and so volumes could grow in the second half of the year, provided that seasonal patterns hold, analysts said. While there are some signs of hope in the data and expectations for a rebound in the second half of the year, we do not expect the damage in the first half of the year to be undone, Morgan Stanley's analysts said. Morgan Stanley lowered its fiscal year estimates for many of the transportation companies. While investment analysts have looked at trimming their outlook for the Class I railroads, shippers appear to be holding onto their expectations for how many railcar orders they expect to order in the next 12 months. With railcar demand appearing to hold steady, Cowen analyst Matt Elkott said rail equipment companies such as Wabtec (NYSE:WAB), Trinity Industries (NYSE:TRN), Greenbrier (NYSE:GBX) and GATX (NYSE:GATX) should be well positioned longer term despite the current economic uncertainty.

2019-07-12,Susquehanna Cuts Transports Price Targets But Anticipates Good Setup For Spot-Exposed Brokers,"Susquehanna analyst Bascome Majors thinks that while contract rates will be under downward pressure for the rest of the year, spot prices may have started to inflect upward. In the past week or so, Wall Street banks have been preparing for second quarter earnings results from transportation and logistics companies and updating their estimates. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE:DB) have revised their earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates downward already and picked their favorite names in a generally weak transportation environment. Morgan Stanley thinks that after Q2 results come in and companies lower their full-year earnings guidance, truckload stocks will be cheap enough to re-enter. Morgan Stanley's Ravi Shanker likes Knight-Swift (NYSE:KNX), Schneider National (NYSE:SNDR), U.S. Xpress (NASDAQ:USX), and Werner Enterprise (NASDAQ:WERN) after projected earnings come down and reset price-to-earnings ratios. Deutsche Bank shared the pessimistic outlook for transportation demand, citing weak manufacturing growth, weaker imports, and elevated industry levels. Still, Deutsche Bank analyst Amit Mehrotra picked some idiosyncratic stories — Knight-Swift may be back in the hunt for acquisitions after successfully integrating Swift and XPO (NYSE:XPO) and is staggeringly under-valued. And of course, the Class 1 rails are expected to continue printing cash regardless of soft volumes due to the further implementation of Precision Scheduled Railroading, especially Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP). This morning Susquehanna analyst Bascome Majors chimed in with his own take on the Q2 outlook for transports. Majors agrees that the second quarter was weaker than expected for transportation because the traditional summer volume surge never fully materialized and overcapacity continues to hold down trucking rates. Still, he thinks that a recent spot rate inflection could bode well for companies whose revenue is tied to the spot market. While we remain cautious as consensus falls, exiting earnings season we see potential to add risk in names exposed to the shorter end of the truckload rate curve (e.g. spot-levered LSTR, ECHO), Majors wrote in an investor note the morning of July 12. Spot rates are more volatile than contract prices and pull them up and down on at least a three month lag. The national average truckload spot rate (DATVF.VNU) began deteriorating in the third quarter of 2018, well before publicly-traded carriers began guiding down expectations for contract prices; in fact, carriers were still telling investors they expected contract rate increases as late as the second quarter of 2019. Majors sees downward pressure on contract rates through the rest of the year as shippers readjust to the wide spread between contract and spot prices and re-align their spend to market conditions. At the same time, spot markets got a healthy June bounce that, while still 23 percent down year-over-year, signaled that capacity is not loose as to become completely unresponsive to seasonality. Turning to a few checks, conversations with brokers were supportive of the rate build seen at the end of June and into early July with uncertainty as to whether increases are the result of capacity leaving a challenged spot environment or destocking of elevated inventories finally starting to play out, Majors wrote. Capacity continues to bleed out of the market, and with the abrupt shutdown of LME (Lakeville Motor Express) on July 11, this year has already witnessed five major trucking carrier exits. FreightWaves is monitoring the number of carrier exits (EXIT.USA) on a quarterly basis by looking at write-downs of bad debt by lenders to trucking companies. The first quarter of 2019 saw a multi-year high in trucking exits, and that number could surge even higher when data for the second quarter are released. To be clear, Susquehanna cut earnings estimates for Echo Global Logistics (NASDAQ:ECHO) and Landstar System (NASDAQ:LSTR) by 9 percent and 3 percent, respectively. It's just that Majors believes once the market fully digests second quarter results, those companies will start inflecting upward. In my view, this is a variation of Amit Mehrotra's second-derivative trade thesis: investors will re-enter not when year-over-year comparisons are positive, because that's too late, but when they've stopped getting worse and start improving. Majors sees some reason for encouragement in spot market data. Seasonally, dry van spot rates have outperformed 2014-2016 average historic seasonality over the past six weeks with rates up 10.4% six-week sequentially (460bps better than the '14-'16 average, boosted by stronger than typical road check impact) as rates steadily climbed higher to close out the quarter, in what we'd characterize as a late but welcome seasonal increase that's typically seen earlier in 2Q, Majors wrote. The Susquehanna note also read through data in other modes for clues to trucking performance. CSX's (NASDAQ:CSX) intermodal volumes have fallen the most of any Class 1 rail in the second quarter, about twice as much as a percentage of total carloadings (-10.2 percent year-over-year) as the other rails, but that contraction is attributed to internal adjustments — CSX exiting low-margin, low-volume lanes — as much as the overall business environment. CSX's primary intermodal partner is Schneider National. J.B. Hunt's (NASDAQ:JBHT) partners BNSF and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) saw intermodal volumes fall 5.2 percent and 2 percent year-over-year, respectively. Majors models 5 percent growth in intermodal volumes for J.B. Hunt in 2020. So while we're encouraged by some capitulating estimate cuts on trucking-related names as pricing outlooks become more realistic, we'd like to see firmer signs of demand stabilization before shifting to a broader ‘risk-on' approach, particularly toward asset-based models, Majors concluded.

2019-07-15,Port Of New Orleans Reopens Following Barry,"The Port of New Orleans has reopened after Tropical Storm Barry swept through the region, although officials still stress dangerous flooding conditions for area residents. Port conditions are normal as of 6 a.m. CT on July 14, enabling vessel movement into and out of the Mississippi River and the Port of New Orleans, albeit with some restrictions, the U.S. Coast Guard said. Those restrictions can be found here. The Coast Guard said early preparation and communication between federal, state, local and industry partners helped minimize the potential for damage at the port. Even while the storm was still approaching landfall, we were making preparations to reopen our ports and restore critical infrastructure and marine transportation systems as quickly as possible after it passed, said Capt. Kristi Luttrell, Sector New Orleans commander for the Coast Guard. Along with the safety of the public and first responders, restoration of maritime commerce was one of our top priorities. The Port of New Orleans said all flood gates along the Mississippi River should be open by the afternoon of July 14, with the port's administration building expected to reopen on July 15 with regular schedules. While the port is operating as normal, some roads that were closed on July 12 are still closed as of July 14, according to the Louisiana Department of Transportation. Up-to-date information on those roads is available here and an interactive map is available here. The area's rail network also has some embargoes in place, but that could also change later this week. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) placed embargoes on July 10 on two routes in Avondale and New Orleans, Louisiana, because of flooding, while Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) said on July 11 that it was working with interline partners to detour New Orleans-bound shipments to alternate gateways. Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) said on July 12 that it placed embargoes traffic interchanging at New Orleans, while BNSF said customers should expect delays and extended travel times for traffic in and out of New Orleans. Meanwhile, the National Hurricane Center said life-threatening flooding rain will persist into July 15 as Barry heads into northwestern Louisiana, bringing potential flash floods. Widespread rainfall of 4 or more inches is expected, with areas of significantly higher rain leading to rapid water rises, the Center said on July 14. Weather.com tweeted that over 150,000 residents and businesses were without power on the morning of July 14. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said on July 14 that he activated 3,000 members of the Louisiana National Guard in response to the storm. The state's Emergency Operations Center is also fully activated, he said. This storm has our attention, Edwards said. While most of the rain right now is in the Gulf, we know that it will be coming ashore and impacting a large portion of the state. We are asking that everyone stay vigilant and be safe. Monitor your local media and heed instructions from your local elected officials. The people of Louisiana are resilient, and while the next few days may be challenging, I am confident that we are going to get through this.Tropical Storm Barry was downgraded from hurricane status after making landfall on July 13.

2019-07-15,"Flooded Roads, Rail And Port Disruptions As Hurricane Barry Comes Ashore In Louisiana","Hurricane Barry made landfall in Louisiana on Saturday, July 13, and immediately weakened Hurricane Barry made landfall in Louisiana on Saturday, July 13, and immediately weakened into a tropical storm with 70 mile per hour winds. As it did, though, it has caused disruption to travel and cargo movement in the region, leading to closed highways, ports, and suspension of rail service. Before the storm, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration suspended certain hours-of-service (HOS) regulations in 21 states for those fleets and/or drivers directly involved in relief efforts following the storm. Right now you can only drive for 11 hours straight, but if you want to provide relief, moving a load from Indiana to Louisiana, for example, you would be allowed to drive straight through, an FMCSA source told FreightWaves. The interstate highway distance between Indianapolis, Indiana, and New Orleans, Louisiana, is roughly 850 miles. Drivers providing direct assistance such as drinking water, generators, and other temporary relief are exempt from HOS regulations in all states on their route to the emergency, even if those states are not included in the stated emergency declaration, according to the FMCSA. Flooding is a concern in Louisiana, as one of the levees in Myrtle Grove was already facing overtopping before the storm hit. The state's lieutenant governor said the levee could only sustain a few hours of overflow before it breeched. In an early afternoon press conference, Governor John Edwards stressed that no levee in the state had failed or was breeched. No Mississippi River levee has been overtopped, and not a single levee in the state of Louisiana — as of right now — has failed or breached, he said. Barry's official landfall was near Intracoastal City, approximately 150 miles west of New Orleans. Roads throughout the region were already covered in water. The Coast Guard said most roads in Grand Isle, Louisiana, were impassable. The Louisiana Department of Transportation, as of 2 p.m. on Saturday, July 13, 2019, was reporting numerous road closures due to water on the roadway. These routes included state routes 317, 182, 1077, 3196, 3078, and 3102 as well as US-51 and US-11. Off-ramps along Interstate 55 were also being affected by water, with closures being reported in some locations. Some lanes on LA-70 near Morgan City were also closed. A map of major road closures in Louisiana, as of 2 p.m. on Saturday, July 13, 2019.

Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) said shipments to and from New Orleans are being impacted due to the closure of flood gates. Precautionary actions are being taken to protect infrastructure, and rail equipment is being repositioned away from the low-lying areas, the company said in a statement. Norfolk Southern is working with customers located in the forecasted region to identify switching needs. BNSF is also telling customers that service has been disrupted. The Port of New Orleans halted all cargo operations on Friday. It has not provided an update as to when it will return to normal operations. Now-Tropical Storm Barry is expected to dump upwards of 20 inches of rain, and maybe even 2 feet in some locations, before it leaves the area, which is seems to be doing slowly as it advances at just 6 mph. Flash flood watches are in effect for the lower Mississippi Valley including parts of Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle. Barry is expected to continue inland over the next several days, weakening significantly. The forecast track calls for its moving through Louisiana into Arkansas by Monday morning and up into Missouri Tuesday. Image Sourced From Pixabay"
2019-07-16,"Hurricane Barry Left Its Mark, But Could Have Been Worse","Despite streets still under water, Barry spared the Gulf Coast from a worse fate over the weekend than what forecasters thought might happen. The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane on Saturday, July 13 near Intracoastal City, Louisiana. It quickly weakened into a tropical storm, but has been inundating parts of the South ever since. Even as a much weaker tropical depression today, July 15, Barry continues to dump heavy rain in parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas, Tennessee and the lower Ohio Valley, prompting ongoing and new flooding concerns. Fears of devastating storm surges and widespread major flooding didn't pan out, overall, and the biggest storm surges didn't happen in the highly populated areas like New Orleans. However, higher-than-expected surges of up to seven feet were reported in other areas. Also, most meteorologists didn't believe the bulk of Barry's moisture would stay over the Gulf of Mexico as long as it did. By the time it moved inland, the storm had weakened enough to keep rainfall totals down. Unlike Hurricane Harvey, which was an over-performer, this storm was a bit of an under-performer, said CNN meteorologist Dave Hennen. As for the flooding, Hennen said Barry was a very strange hurricane…I think the strangest I have ever covered. SONAR Critical Events: Weather alert for Tropical Depression Barry on June 15, 2019. The flooding threat isn't over, however. The National Weather Service (NWS) is predicting Barry will drop another three to five inches of additional rain today in central Louisiana and southwestern Mississippi, with pockets of up to eight inches. The NWS has issued Flash Flood Watches across these areas. Dangerous flash flooding is likely across this area into this afternoon, the National Hurricane Center posted this morning. Isolated tornadoes are also possible today from the Mid-South toward the lower Ohio Valley. These areas will be in the northeastern quadrant of the tropical system, the quadrant known for producing twisters. All the new rain means Barry will leave some places with totals of 15 to 20 inches of rain by the time the storm's remnants dissipate by mid-week. Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said at a press conference Sunday evening, July 14, that he was extremely grateful that the forecasted rains and flooding did not materialize. He said all state offices would be open today, except in a few parishes where the power is still out. He was thankful that the worst-case scenario didn't happen, and urged people not to let down their guards. I want to remind everyone it's just July. Typically we see most activity in August and Sept, added Edwards. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said many staples of city life would resume Monday, including public transportation, as well as recycling and trash collection services. While not as destructive as feared, Barry did overwhelm some levees and cause widespread power outages. Several parishes, including Terrebonne, Lafourche, Jefferson and St. Mary, were flooded when water overtopped levees on Saturday. Also, because of Barry, officials had to close 16 roads and 24 bridges over the weekend, according to the Louisiana Department of Transportation. More than 153,000 customers across Louisiana had lost power at one point due to strong winds and downed trees on Sunday. Entergy Louisiana said it brought in crews from all over the country to help restore power. The Louisiana coastal community of Isle de Jean Charles had already lost 98 percent of its land prior to the storm. After Barry made landfall on Saturday, some residents were stranded through Sunday as high flood water kept roads closed. In another island community, Iberia Parish, strong winds destroyed some buildings. SONAR Tickers: ITRI.MSY, OTRI.MSY Barry has caused only minor disruptions in supply chains and freight movement. with the damage turning out to be less than anticipated in the major population area around New Orleans. It's still too early to know the exact amount of damage, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) did waive hours of service regulations for any carriers hauling relief supplies to the affected areas. There were no significant disruptions to contracted freight, as the storm hit over the weekend in a relatively low volume area. Many carriers made adjustments to their routing last week as FreightWaves' SONAR data indicated inbound tender rejections (ITRI.MSY) had increased from under 5 percent to more than 7 percent leading up to landfall. Outbound rejection rates (OTRI.MSY) fell from almost 12 percent to 8.5 percent leading up to the weekend as carriers took the opportunity to leave the area. Volumes did increase marginally over the past few days as shippers attempted to move freight out of the storm's path. The Outbound Tender Market Share index (OTMS.MSY) shows this, indicating an increase of 5.4 percent from July 11 to July 14. Norfolk Southern railroad (NYSE:NSC) announced on July 14 that it would return to normal operations in the New Orleans area now that Barry has weakened. However, shipments to and through New Orleans will experience delays of 24 to 48 hours. The company continues to work with interline partners to detour interchange traffic over alternate gateways where possible to minimize the impact. On July 10, Union Pacific railroad (NYSE:UNP) said the following in a customer announcement: We are also monitoring Tropical Storm Barry developing in the Gulf of Mexico. Rail traffic interchanged with eastern carriers at New Orleans has been restricted, as flood gates were closed this afternoon. Traffic moving through New Orleans will be rerouted through alternative locations until the storm passes. Union Pacific has placed embargoes for the locations of New Orleans and Avondale due to the gate closures and potential flooding. BNSF (NYSE: BRK.A) railroad officials said on June 11, Due to the gate closures and flooding concerns, BNSF is holding all New Orleans-bound trains from moving into the area. The New Orleans Public Belt Railroad (NOPB), the switching railroad which services the Port of New Orleans and other local industries, has informed other rail carriers that it is no longer accepting inbound traffic. NOPB plans to resume operations to customer facilities once this storm passes and as soon as flood gates have reopened. Customers with shipments scheduled to move into the region should expect delays throughout the duration of this storm event. With the New Orleans interchange gateway likely closed through the weekend, our operations teams are working with other carriers to identify alternate gateways unaffected by this storm to minimize disruptions to interchange traffic as much as possible.

2019-07-17,Shippers Want More Changes To Demurrage And Accessorial Charges,"Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) are modifying some of the ways they collect demurrage and accessorial charges for some commodities, but some shippers are questioning the modifications. The changes are part of both companies' broader efforts to encourage shippers to turn railcars around faster and allow for a smoother transition to precision scheduled railroading, an operating model that streamlines operational schedules. But the shorter turnaround time-frames have resulted in hefty financial penalties for some shippers, prompting the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to host a two-day hearing on demurrage and accessorial charges in May. Shippers have also said they are penalized for the bunching of railcars even though they aren't at fault for the bunching, which is the delivery of too many railcars at once. The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) submitted a letter to the STB on July 12 to express its concerns on NSC's recent revisions to its tariffs governing demurrage and storage and accessorial charges. Most of the revisions will go into effect on September 1. While ISRI appreciated some of the changes, the trade group said more modifications are needed to NSC's tariffs program. While several of the changes to the NSC tariffs would incrementally improve or eliminate certain egregious practices or charges, on the whole, they fall far short in addressing the serious concerns identified by ISRI members (and others), including the reasonableness of extremely limited credit days (i.e. zero days for private cars and 24 hours for railroad-owned cars), charges resulting from the bunching of cars, and invoicing and claims practices that create unfair obstacles to the efficient auditing and resolution of demurrage-related invoices and disputes, the ISRI letter said. NSC announced on July 1 that it was modifying its tariffs to introduce service credit eligibility for empty, private railcars. It is also revising its service credit program for loaded cars, and it said customers will be able to schedule diversions in advance of a railcar's arrival. These changes would go into effect on September 1. NSC also said that effectively immediately, customers will be able to dispute demurrage and storage charges without charge, and the railroad said it was in the process of reformatting and reviewing its tariff on switching. Meanwhile, UNP announced on July 2 that it would be updating its existing reservation system at certain intermodal terminals. The Intermodal Terminal Reservation System would replace the current Gate Reservation System at six West Coast intermodal terminals – East Coast Los Angeles, LATC, City of Industry, Lathrop, Brooklyn and TacSim. UNP will also roll out the technology at additional domestic terminals. UNP said the new reservation system, which will be implemented starting on August 6, will allow for better planning of drays and ingates. But a shipper told FreightWaves it is concerned about the new accessorial fees of $25 for reservations cancelled less than 24 hours prior to the gate cutoff and $50 for reservation no-shows. UNP said in its notice that the new reservation system will match customer reservations more closely with train capacity and terminal fluidity. The railroad also said it would apply a $100 credit for each individual unit that ingates before cutoff and does not depart on its corresponding train. Implementation of the fees and the credit would not begin until September 3. UNP will release its second quarter results on July 18, while NSC will report its results on July 24.

2019-07-17,The Street Debates: Should Investors Buy The Dip In CSX?,"Railroad company CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) reported Tuesday with second-quarter results that were notable for a miss on the EPS and revenue lines. Here's how some of the Street's top analysts reacted. The Analysts RBC Capital Markets' Walter Spracklin maintained a Sector Perform rating on CSX with a price target lowered from $78 to $75. Raymond James' Patrick Tyler Brown maintained at Outperform, price target lowered from $84 to $81. UBS' Thomas Wadewitz maintained at Neutral, unchanged $81 price target. RBC: Key Takeaways CSX reported a weaker-than-expected second quarter, including an EPS miss at $1.08 versus $1.11; lower yields; and a lower operating ratio, Spracklin said in a Wednesday note. Revenue fell 1% from the same quarter a year ago due to lower intermodal volumes and lower other revenue due to decreased demurrage charges, the analyst said. Carloads were also lower year-over-year by 4%, mostly due to decreased domestic intermodal volumes, with weakness noted in metals and equipment and fertilizer volumes, he said. CSX expressed a cautious view on the back half of 2019 by lowering its revenue outlook from a range of positive by a low-single digit to down 1%-2%, Spracklin said. CSX's back half could be negatively impacted by trade uncertainties and an unclear macro environment, he said. Related Link: CSX Lowers Revenue Outlook For 2019 Raymond James: Opportunity To Improve Operating Ratio On top of an EPS and revenue miss, CSX also reported an EBIT miss of $1.305 billion versus expectations of $1.355 billion, Brown said in a Wednesday note. The operating ratio did improve by 120 basis points from last year to 57.4% as the company continues to move toward its sub-60% goal in 2019, the analyst said. The company's OR represents a U.S. Class I record, but this is overshadowed by management's revised revenue guidance, he said. CSX could see more OR improvements moving forward due to greater internal efficiencies and cost-take outs, Brown said. The railroad's focus on creating a more service-centric product across the entire business will ultimately result in pricing, volume and earnings growth, according to RayJay. UBS: Negative Read-Through For Rivals CSX's management expressed a cautious outlook on volume trends as part of its revenue guidance reduction, Wadewitz said in a Wednesday note. The clear weakness in volume shouldn't come as a surprise, but signals a negative read-through on EPS expectations for rival domestic railroads, the analyst said. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) shares the most similarities with CSX in terms of customer concentration, and Tuesday's print likely points to similar softening at Norfolk, he said. Yet Norfolk got a head start in its PSR and operating improvement programs, so it has the potential to show better earnings growth with cost reductions despite the headwinds, according to UBS. Price Action Shares of CSX were trading lower by around 10% Wednesday afternoon. Related Link: Commentary: Understanding The Railroads' Quarterly Earnings And What Else To Ask...

2019-07-18,South Carolina Ports Tapping Rail And Inland Hubs More In 2019,"The South Carolina Port Authority (SCPA) said ocean container moves were up 9 percent in its fiscal year, setting a volume record for the port. The Port of Charleston's two main container terminals, Wando Welch and North Charleston, saw 2.4 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) in container moves last year. The region's freight moves represent broad slices of the economy. Boeing produces the Dreamliner 787 in Charleston. Mercedes and Volvo also both produce cars in South Carolina. The outlook for those shippers, though, is mixed. Boeing won a new round of orders for the Dreamliner in June. But Mercedes parent Daimler AG (FSE: DAI) has warned of slower demand in the second half of 2019. The port also touted the increasing role of intermodal rail in moving boxes off of the docks. The SCPA said Inland Port Greer saw its busiest year ever with 143,204 containers moved in fiscal 2019, a 22 percent increase from last year. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) serves Inland Port Greer, which is also a distribution hub for parts going to BMW's (FRA: BMW) Spartanburg factory. Inland Port Greer is near the I-85 corridor, approximately half-way between Charlotte and Atlanta and within 500 miles of 94 million consumers, the SCPA said. Trucking demand out of the Inland Port Greer region dropped in July after a relatively healthy June. The Outbound Tender Reject Index for Greenville, South Carolina, (SONAR: OTRI.GSP) last sat at 4.09, compared to a six-month high of 7.60 in June. The state's other major intermodal hub, Inland Port Dillon, saw about 30,000 rail moves in fiscal 2019. CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) provides intermodal service to Inland Port Dillon. Overall, the SCPA said the volume of freight moving on rail is at new highs, with 330,000 rail moves in fiscal 2019, accounting for nearly one-quarter of all containers coming through the port. The growth of intermodal rail out of the port appears to be smoothing out volatility in the local trucking market, but demand spikes are recurring. The Local Outbound Tender Rejection Index (SONAR: COTRI.CHS) hit its highest 2019 year-to-date level in June. Our container business handled a record amount of cargo, our inland ports in Greer and Dillon both had strong growth year-over-year and our rail program moved more cargo than ever before, said Jim Newsome, chief executive of SCPA. He said, As we head into fiscal 2020, we will continue investing in our infrastructure to handle growth, as well as supporting our employees and the entire maritime community who make these significant achievements possible. Among SCPA's main capital projects are the Hugh Leatherman Terminal, a 286-acre container terminal, along with adjacent roads and a near-dock rail facility. With construction starting this year and ongoing dredging of the harbor, the Leatherman terminal is expected to increase capacity 50 percent by 2021. SCPA is also improving its Wando Welch Terminal, which handles close to 80 percent of freight moving through Charleston. When the improvements are completed in 2020, the terminal will be able to service three post-panamax ships at one time. Those improvements include wharf upgrades, five additional ship-to-shore cranes, raising the height of four existing cranes, and additional cargo handling equipment. Image Sourced by Pixabay"
2019-07-23,U.S. Rail Headcount Falls In June,"U.S. railroads had fewer employees on their payroll in June amid lower rail volumes overall and company decisions to trim workforce levels as part of changes to their operating models. The U.S. operations of the Class I railroads employed 141,360 employees in June, a 4 percent drop from employee levels in June 2018 and a 1.1 percent drop from May 2019, according to the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. The largest number of employees shed year-over-year were executives, officials and staff assistants, which decreased 7.5 percent, and maintenance of equipment and stores, which dropped by 5.3 percent. The category with the most employees, the train and engine category, had 3.9 percent fewer employees in June 2019 compared with June 2018. Compared with May 2019, the U.S. Class I rail operations had 1.5 percent fewer train and engine crew members on their rosters. The drop in rail headcount comes as the railroads are hauling lower volumes this year compared with last year. The railroads tend to cut employee levels as they match rail capacity with demand. The workforce reduction also coincides with efforts by some Class I railroads to deploy precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operating model that seeks to streamline operations and rail schedules. Switching to the operating model results in railroads having fewer employees. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) are among the companies that have deployed some version of PSR over the past year. CSX (NYSE:CSX) chief executive officer Jim Foote also talked about looking at ways to reduce headcount levels during CSX's second quarter earnings call recently. UNP chief executive officer Lance Fritz also spoke about the topic on his company's recent earnings call. When volumes get softer, we know how to adjust our resources to match what volume represents. But I would have to say, the lion's share of what you saw was about Unified Plan 2020 [UNP's version of PSR] and productivity. And you can see that kind of across the board. We had to adjust the amount of resources we put at locomotives as we parked about a quarter of the locomotive fleet if not more. Fritz continued, And you can see that directly related to the headcount, to the manpower that we have attached to maintaining locomotives. The same is true on maintaining cars. The same is true on the TE&Y [train, engine and yard] workforce. We've taken a lot of work out of the network and it's being reflected now in our manpower. And we've got – there are more of those adjustments to be made as the network continues to stabilize and as we continue to find opportunity. KSU's chief financial officer Mike Upchurch said, We did begin to see approximately $1 million in savings from crew start reductions and continue to believe our overall headcount will be down for the year as we continue to make progress with PSR, particularly once our new transportation service plan is finalized.

2019-07-23,Commentary: The Complexity Of Owning Or Leasing Freight Cars,"FreightWaves features Market Voices – a forum for voices with unique knowledge of numerous transportation/logistics/supply chain sectors, as well as other critical expertise. Railroad freight is a volume business. Shippers and receivers are unlikely to turn to the nation's railroad carriers for those freight cars if their volumes are light. That is simple economics. However, if a company is a high-volume shipper, then its management will consider owning or renting its own railcars. If the company is shipper of chemicals or crude oil, the answer is simple. There are no railroads providing free rail tank cars. Therefore, the company's management must choose between owning or leasing the tank cars needed to carry its products. Other shippers of commodities from coal to grain can rely in large part on using railway pool equipment. If sufficient railcars are available, then leasing or buying railcars is optional. Overall, more than 60 percent of North American freight cars are leased or owned by others – not by the railroads. It wasn't that way 50 years ago, according to Progressive Railroading. The private source share shown in the pie chart includes some small private railroads, shippers, receivers and some railcar manufacturers with ownership. Image courtesy of Progressive Railroading Railroad companies like Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) and Norfolk Southern Company (NYSE:NSC) own various railcar types like gondolas for steel and pipe, covered hopper cars for grain, and open top hopper cars for coal, ores and similar bulk commodities. Railroad boxcars are another exception to the overall private car pattern. As of 2015, North American railroads owned more than 75 percent of all boxcars. So why would a shipper lease or purchase a railway freight car? After all, leasing or owning adds to a shipper's logistical burden. The pros of leasing or owning railcars Having greater control of the supply chain is likely to be the most critical reason a shipper would decide to own or lease its own railcars. With railcar lease or ownership, shippers are not subject to the vagaries of supply and demand from other users of that railcar type. Shippers directly control available transport capacity by linking their car fleet directly with their production line. Shippers also control their forward inventory movement. They can move commodities forward to holding yards closer to the next step in the production process, or to their own or customers' factories or distribution centers. Ownership or leasing also can reduce the demurrage charges assessed by railroads. Demurrage has been a major issue this year, with Surface Transportation Board hearings taking place in May. The corollary on demurrage, however, is that private railcars cannot be randomly left at critical railroad yards or holding tracks. Instead, the railcars would have to be moved to private yards or storage tracks. Another benefit is that private railcars act as portable storage units – if the final receiver unexpectedly can't handle railcar delivery or unloading. However, shippers should be beware. Railcar leasing is not a trip lease. Railcar leasing is a relatively long-term commitment to possession and use. Railcar leases are subject to negotiation of terms. But in a conventional business cycle, a railcar lease is for a seven-year period, plus or minus. In contrast, owning a railway freight car is often a 30-year or longer capital commitment. Railway freight cars last much longer than semi-trailers or containers do. Actual rail car life often exceeds 40 years. Finally, railroad rates are typically discounted if shippers provide their own railcars. Why? Because the railroad gets a better return on its balance sheet by not owning your cars. The cons of leasing or owning railcars Leasing or ownership comes with administrative burdens and financial issues. Leasing and ownership both require a corporate fleet management function. Then there is the burden of overseeing the periodic car maintenance functions within prescribed federal safety rules and the terms of the negotiated lease. There are financial and cash flow requirements. If a shipper is new to shipping by rail, its management must either decide to staff up or contract for expert help to negotiate the process. Fortunately, there are reputable service providers and consultants to help. There is even an annual forum that examines the complexity or leasing, owning and pricing. There are also fleet sizing and purchase timing issues. For example, shippers want to avoid buying or leasing into a fleet size bubble. Another key consideration is that these cars are very expensive. New railcars a decade ago cost about $90,000; they now fetch a 2019 price in the $140,000 range. Be aware, that railway equipment contracts are strictly enforced. This is not like agreeing to a movement contract on a spot rate basis. Leasing and owning railcars is a serious legal and financial commitment. Enforcement of terms tends to favor the lessor – which may be a bank, a third-party or the railcar manufacturer. Storing excess railcars when there is a downturn in the nation's economy can be expensive as well. Leasing too much equipment can result in both ongoing monthly payments plus fees to private track owners or small railroad companies that might have space available to store railcars not needed. Parking fees often range from $100 to $450 or more per railcar per month. Need to store railcars with undelivered commodities inside? That comes at a higher storage fee and sometimes also with regulatory inspection requirements. Need to move the railcar from one storage spot to another? Then expect to pay both a car-miles and a switching fee to the railroad. Switching costs often are in the $300 and up range for both the empty and the loaded position switch. The biggest uncertainty may be the risks of leasing or buying at the wrong time. For example, in March 2019, some car brokerage appraisers and experts warned … there are just too many cars in the system. It appears to have been an accurate assessment. Have investors listened and reacted? Today, about 20 percent of the 1.67 million North American railroad car fleet as measured by the American Association of Railroads is technically in storage. That means almost 360,000 freight cars are not being used at this time. Due diligence suggests that over-supply risks are periodically much higher. A decade ago during the Great Recession, about 30 percent of the North American freight railcar fleet was estimated to be in storage. Therefore, expert market intelligence and market timing are critical to making these private freight railcar asset decisions. Conclusions Owning and leasing a fleet of railcars when a company's core competency is in manufacturing or something else is a tough decision. Four decades ago, when so many railroads like the Penn Central and Milwaukee Road were in bankruptcy, private railcar leasing and ownership was an easier decision. Many railroads were simply incapable of meeting railcar supply demand back then. The rail industry's 1970 era return on invested assets was only 2 percent and their costs to borrow were much higher. Today, adding new private cars – or modernizing an aging railcar fleet – is more prevalent. But the process is a challenge. Often buying used equipment that was well-maintained by the previous users can be a better approach than buying new. Older, well-maintained railcars at low-demand periods might be available at about $30,000 per railcar. How does a shipper make those choices? There are responsible parties that specialize in such transactions. They can independently appraise both market value and mechanical condition of the railway cars. These third parties can help shippers navigate the process of registering the equipment with multiple organizations. Soliciting financing is also a critical task. The good news is that there are many competing potential investors in the private railcar market.

2019-07-24,Norfolk Southern's Net Profit Rises Despite Declining Volumes,"Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) second quarter net profit rose slightly as the company prepared to launch the next phase in its new precision scheduled railroading (PSR) operating model. Net profit increased 2 percent to $722 million in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2018. Diluted earnings per share were $2.70 in the second quarter, an 8 percent increase from the same period last year. Despite a 4 percent drop in total volume in the second quarter, operating revenue rose by 1 percent to $2.9 billion amid a 5 percent increase in revenue per unit. Meanwhile, operating expenses were $1.9 billion, which is $12 million less than expenses in the second quarter of 2018, amid lower fuel prices and lower purchased services and rests. Income from NSC's railway operations rose by 4 percent $1.1 billion, which contributed to a second quarter operating ratio of 63.6 percent compared with an operating ratio of 64.6 percent in the second quarter of 2018. A declining operating ratio can imply a company's increasing profitability. Our strong financial and operational performance in the second quarter was achieved while also finalizing preparations for the successful implementation of our new operating plan, TOP21. This execution reflects the strength of our team, commitment to our customers, and power of our balanced strategic plan to deliver enhanced shareholder value, NSC chief executive officer James A. Squires said. Average train speeds in the second quarter rose 19 percent to 21. 9 hours, compared with 18.4 miles per hour for the same period of 2018. Average terminal dwell, which is the amount of time that a train stays at a terminal, dropped 37 percent to 18.2 hours compared with 28.7 hours in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in second quarter net profit comes as NSC deployed its next phase of TOP21. This phase was rolled out in the first week of July with minimal impact to customer service and network operations, the company said on July 22. Norfolk Southern said TOP21 will reduce circuity, improve velocity and result in more predictable transit times. With a goal of a smooth transition in mind, the company said it hosted 19 town hall meetings with employees and customers prior to the July 1 implementation, and it established two 24/7 command centers to monitor network status and customer concerns as the changeover occurred.

2019-07-24,Norfolk Southern Says Operational Changes Key To Boosting 2019 Profits,"Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) expects continued operational changes will help boost profits and lower operating ratios in the second half of the year. Top21 and Clean Sheeting are two initiatives that arose out of NSC's version of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operating model that seeks to streamline operations. These initiatives exposed numerous opportunities for cost savings in the second half of this year and beyond, which we are now aggressively pursuing. These savings, coupled with the modest top line growth we expect in the back half, give us confidence we will achieve our stated goals even amid economic uncertainty, said NSC chief executive officer Jim Squires during his company's second quarter earnings call on July 24. The company earlier in the day reported a 2 percent increase in net profit in the second quarter despite a 4 percent drop in volumes. From an operational perspective, NSC said it is focusing on finding cost savings by addressing efficiencies at serving rail yards and local operations. It is also exploring ways to address cost savings via locomotive maintenance. As part of its TOP21 plan, NSC is exploring how to expand the use of distributed power for its merchandise and automotive trains. Distributed power, which is the practice of putting locomotives in the middle or throughout the length of a train, enables longer trains. Norfolk Southern is also seeking to reduce circuitous miles by at least 20 percent by utilizing capacity at regional yards and focusing less on creating density at hump yards. We've already converted two hump yards to flat switch operations coming out of TOP21. And we'll continue to look things over. It really depends on the level of volume under the new plan that's moving through a given yard, Squires said. Once that volume drops below a certain level, it makes sense to convert to a flat switch operation as long as you're going to keep it open. But we'll continue to work on that. There may be opportunities – other opportunities around the network, in addition we're looking over our entire portfolio of local serving yards to see what fits well with TOP21 and what doesn't, Squires said. The company is also seeking to reduce trains miles for its manifest, automotive and local trains by 10 percent while reducing train starts by 10 percent, according to NSC chief operating officer Mike Wheeler. This will result in a more efficient network with fewer trains, Wheeler said. We are confident that execution of our new operating plan will drive further improvement in the near- and long-term. When looking at commodities that could see revenue growth in the second half of the year, NSC factored in macroeconomic conditions such as high consumer confidence and low unemployment levels, with tariff uncertainty remaining a headwind primarily for the manufacturing sector, NSC marketing officer Alan Shaw said. Sectors that could see growth in the second half of the year include automotive, crude oil, fracking sand and aggregates. We remain confident in continued growth in the economy, although at a lower rate than what we experienced in 2018, Shaw said. Based on this economic backdrop, we expect modest year-over-year improvement in revenue, volume and RPU [revenue per unit] in the second half of the year, with the bulk of that growth in the fourth quarter. The company also expects its domestic intermodal segment to grow in the second half of the year based on its conversations with channel partners, with further lane rationalizations could occurring sometime in the future, Shaw said. Intermodal spot rates are starting to improve, with intermodal volume projected to finish 2019 slightly above 2018 levels, Shaw said. Consumer spending is projected to boost the international and domestic intermodal markets, although domestic growth could be tempered by an increase in truck capacity, he said.

2019-07-25,U.S. Rail Volumes Continue Dip,"U.S. rail volumes fell yet again for the week ending July 20, according to data from the Association of American Railroads. Total U.S. rail traffic fell on both a weekly and year-to-date basis compared to the same periods in 2018. On a year-to-date basis, U.S. rail volume totaled 14.98 million carloads and intermodal units, a 3.4 percent drop from a year ago. Of that, U.S. carloads totaled 7.29 million carloads, a 3.1 percent decrease from the second quarter of 2018. U.S. intermodal containers and trailers fell 3.5 percent to 3.69 million intermodal units. On a weekly basis, the U.S. operations of the Class I railroads originated 526,010 carloads and intermodal units, which is 4.9 percent fewer than the same period in 2018. U.S. carloads fell 4.2 percent to 254,434 carloads while intermodal units dropped 5.6 percent to 271,576 intermodal containers and trailers. Rail volumes in Mexico were also down both weekly and year-to-date. Mexican rail traffic was down 3.4 percent year-to-date to 1.08 million carloads and intermodal units. On a weekly basis, Mexican rail volumes fell 2.4 percent to 38,955 carloads and intermodal units. But despite these declines, Mexican rail volumes were up by 1.7 percent year-over-year on a rolling, four-week basis. Meanwhile, Canadian rail volumes continued to grow year-over year. Canadian rail volumes were up 2.1 percent to 4.37 million carloads and intermodal units year-to-date, Weekly Canadian volumes rose 3 percent to 153,968 carloads and intermodal units. Despite reporting lower second quarter volumes this week and last week during second quarter earnings calls, Class I railroads reported higher revenues or profit gains amid cuts to operating expenses. The rail companies are cautiously optimistic that rail volumes could grow in the second half of the year, but they also told investors that they were looking at ways to trim costs further in order to increase their profit prospects for the remainder of the year. We are focused on the things that we can control, and those things are delivery of revenue growth, said Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) chief executive officer Jim Squires during his company's second quarter earnings call on July 24. Squires continued, At the same time, we are very focused on the productivity and efficiency opportunities that we have uncovered through Clean Sheeting and through TOP21 implementation, two initiatives in NSC's version of precision scheduled railroading. So, we're focused on the things that we can control and we are very confident that we will hit our goals this year, at least 100 basis points improvement in the operating ratio over last year and 60 by 2021.

2019-07-31,Hub Group Calls For Short-Lived Downturn,"On its conference call with analysts, investors and the media, Hub Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HUBG) signaled that the current soft demand freight environment will likely be short-lived. After the close of markets on July 30, 2019, HUBG reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.87, well ahead of the analysts' expectations of $0.74 and last year's $0.51. Takeaways from the call On the call, management provided a good deal of color on current intermodal and truck market fundamentals. They said that while intermodal volumes were off significantly year-over-year in the second quarter, they expect volume declines will begin to flatten out and that the 2019 peak shipping season will be similar to that of 2017. When asked why they have confidence in this call they cited recent conversations with their rail partners and customers as well as recent tightening in freight demand at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports. Along those lines, HUBG's transcontinental intermodal movements were only off 2 percent in the second quarter compared to local east volumes which were down 9 percent, local west which was down 7 percent and other (which includes Mexico) which was down 11 percent. Additionally, the year-over-year intermodal declines (-2 percent in April, -8 percent in May, -11 percent in June and -4 percent in July) may be reaching an inflection point. Management said that the shorter length of haul markets (local east and west) were seeing increased competition from truckload (TL) as truck pricing remains depressed. They said that TL pricing is comparable to intermodal pricing levels in the shorter haul markets. They are pointing to the 2019 peak season, which they expect to resemble the 2017 peak, as a point at which truck capacity could tighten. They believe that as the TL capacity overhang is reduced, TL pricing will move higher and the typical gap between TL and intermodal pricing (intermodal rates are typically priced at a meaningful discount to TL rates) will return, thus improving intermodal volumes. Looking forward, they expect to see sequential intermodal volume improvement in the back-half of 2019, with 2020 volumes likely flat to slightly down year-over-year. Currently, HUBG's intermodal pricing has improved in the low to mid-single digit range with 80 percent of its 2019 bid season (contractual negotiations) complete. HUBG executives believe that the company can continue to see yield improvement as their strategy takes hold. They said the company is building customer trust as its service improves. The service improvements are being driven by improved fluidity at its railroad partners. Management said that its eastern rail partner, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), is seeing record [service] levels and noted that its main western rail partner, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), has seen service improvements of 1,400 basis points. Further, they believe that their operating margin goal of 5 percent is attainable as internal technology improvements will help them continue to improve service and drive headcount costs lower over time. Financial results HUBG reported consolidated revenue of $921 million, a 3 percent year-over-year increase. Operating income improved 60 percent to $41 million as the company's operating margin increased 160 basis points compared to the year ago period at 4.4 percent. Yield improvement and an intense focus on cost management were cited as the reasons for the improved results. HUBG revenue by division HUBG's largest division, intermodal, reported a 1 percent increase in revenue to $543 million in the second quarter. Improved yield and efficiency were largely offset by a 7 percent decline in intermodal volumes. The volume declines stemmed from a weaker demand environment and increased TL and intermodal competition. Lane cancellations and weather disruptions accounted for a 2 percent volume decline. Truck brokerage revenue declined 7 percent year-over-year to $107.1 million. The division saw an 18 percent increase in loads moved, but that was more than offset by fuel headwinds, softer pricing and freight mix, which were a 25 percent drag in the period. The less-than-truckload (LTL) brokerage business, CaseStack, was noted as the driver of unfavorable revenue mix. Logistics revenue increased 15 percent to $194 million given the CaseStack acquisition and HUBG's dedicated revenue grew 5 percent to $78 million year-over-year due to pricing improvements and penetration in new accounts. Management noted that the outlook for the dedicated division was strong as there is potentially $100 million in new business in the pipeline. Additionally, HUBG has been adding new dedicated contracts which are achieving rate increases in the mid-single digit range. Guidance The bottom-end of management's 2019 guidance range was raised $0.05 to $3.30 with the top-end of the range left untouched at $3.40. Revenue is forecasted to grow in the mid-single digit range for the full year. The company's full year capital expenditure range was lowered to $100 million to $110 million from $115 million to $125 million. Management said that the reduction in spending is due to a reduction in planned tractor and trailer spending in 2019. In 2020, capital expenditures will likely be in the $140 to $150 million range as the company will see an increase in equipment replacement and as it completes a second office building. HUBG previously announced a $55 million budget for a new building at its headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, $25 million of which was to be spent in 2019. The second office building will bring total headcount capacity to 1,400 employees at this campus. HUBG reported 5,400 employees, including 3,100 drivers, at the end of 2018.

2019-07-31,Commentary: After Investor Reports – What Does Rail Freight Look Like For The Remainder Of 2019?,"FreightWaves features Market Voices – a forum for voices with unique knowledge of numerous transportation/logistics/supply chain sectors, as well as other critical expertise. Railroad managements have now reported their second quarter and cumulative results through the first half of 2019. The press releases were basically focused on the companies' financials and accounting information. Revenues and yield dominated the measurements, as did resulting cash flows, earnings per share and return on investment. The conference calls that followed the press releases focused upon analysts questions that sometimes challenged management's financial assumptions and outlook regarding the business revenues and yields ahead for the second-half of 2019. Clearly, quarterly reports are geared towards profitability and prospects of buying and selling of stock. Multiple parties utilize independent revenue and operating expense spreadsheets (models to estimate outlooks about each of the seven major Class I railroads. The analysis is often stated as a series of calculations. The projections are typically stated with a high/low stock price and risks. If you're a FreightWaves shipper, that's not really your interest. Your perspective isn't about buy or sell valuations. It's about how the rail movement workload by key lanes and basic commodity sectors will change. You are focused instead on the ‘waves' of freight that will or will not show up as demanded movement… and the railroads' capabilities to supply that predicted volume. In short, how will the supply of railroad resources play out against market demand in the remaining five months of 2019? What's that business volume outlook look like? The market demand outlook is unclear. Experts differ in their projections of both railway and trucking traffic. There are mixed economic outlooks in the marketplace regarding freight demand. Even the railroad executives couldn't agree on their volume forecasts. For example, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) was slightly negative, while Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) was more positive. FreightWaves SONAR: Total rail carloads during 2019 to-date. Let's examine two rail markets – Canada and the U.S. Why two? Because they differ. Canada has a distinctive upside for rail freight. That's driven in part by higher growth rates along the Canadian track network. Both Vancouver and Prince Rupert ports see strong year-ending growth in imported containers that originate in Asia. Crude oil by rail out of Alberta (plus the Bakken) is also increasing. However, remember that the U.S. railroad network moves three to four times the total volume of the Canadian rail network. Population density plays a part in this difference. Here are a few comparisons to keep in mind about the relative sizes of the two railway markets. From the American Association of Railroads report, Rail Time Indicator – published July 5, 2019 Both Canadian railroads see continuing strong second-half traffic volume. The consensus is that both Canadian Pacific Railway (NYSE:CP) and Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) will see significant traffic growth in intermodal, coal, grain and crude oil into December. Both grain and intermodal traffic volume on CP and CNI might grow at more than a 3 percent rate during the remaining months. Why so high? It could be source competition. Canada railroads may pick up some of the slack seen in U.S. trade. There could be substitution selling of Canadian-sourced grain into international markets resulting from rain and flood disruption of U.S. planting and harvest dates for crops of Midwestern corn, wheat and soybeans. Back in the United States, rail freight growth has definitely slowed this year. BNSF Railroad crews replenishing ballast onto tracks damaged by flooding near La Platte, Nebraska. (Photo credit: BNSF) Western railroad companies like BNSF ((a unit of Berkshire Hathaway –, NYSE:BRK) and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) have been hammered by rain and flood damage. The physical inability to move freight over strategic rail links has taken a toll on traffic volume growth. Freight cannot be moved when the railway tracks are flooded or worse, washed out. However, flooding doesn't explain the drop in eastern railroad volume. Some of the drop in the East is a result of selected lower volume and lower profitability intermodal lane exit strategies. A second force is the overcapacity in trucking and the resulting drop in spot rates that are now in certain short to moderate lane distances making trucking cheaper for the shipper than intermodal rail. It appears that the railroad response to these unexpected spot rates has been to maintain pricing discipline and margin yield. Translation – the railroad companies don't appear to be lowering price to keep volume. How long might this pricing and margin strategy continue? It is hard to tell. But given that the tradition of railroad pricing as private contracts – it's likely that there may not be any railroad company pricing changes until 2020. There may be some intermodal third-party contract price discounting against the rates they have from the big railroad companies. Intermodal volume trending At the beginning of 2019, some experts like Ron Sucik conservatively estimated that total year intermodal growth would be in the 3.5 percent range. That was based upon the results from the first two months. Others expected more robust 5 percent growth in intermodal. In contrast, the first quarter of 2018 saw a robust 7.2 percent increase. That marked the highest first quarter intermodal growth in nearly four years. As July 2019 closes here is the current U.S. intermodal scorecard: Intermodal U.S. units were down 5.7 percent for the second quarter Intemodal U.S. units were down 7.2 percent during June The June drop marked five continuous monthly declines About 3 percent (9,000 cars) of the intermodal fleet are ‘stored' In perspective, the first half of 2019 is still a stronger intermodal volume than occurred in the same period of 2017. A five-month volume outlook Indications of lower import container volumes moving towards key U.S. West Coast ports suggest a possible lowering of transcontinental double-stack train demand into August. If true, this is going to lower year-over-year third quarter intermodal rail volumes. It is possible that the next five months might see a 3 to 5 percent drop in year-over-year intermodal volume. That's not a prediction. It is a precautionary alert based upon signals in the overall economy and circumstances surrounding international trade. In contrast, going back to the 2010 to 2012 period, the movement of domestic and international containers by rail grew in the 8 to 12 percent range. Meanwhile, freight-sensitive economic indicators like industrial output remain weak into the summer months. Auto manufacturing and high auto inventory are another possible flashing alert. Also, no big grain export sales have been announced. The initial U.S. second quarter GDP number of only 2.1 percent is another challenging indicator. Growth in the goods sector of the U.S. economy was recently estimated at just 1.4 percent. That sector has been declining since the second quarter of 2018. This mark is now back to its fourth quarter 2015 to first quarter 2016 range of 1.4 percent to 1.7 percent. Beyond rail intermodal, the carload freight sector volume is also likely to drop. A 2 percent year-over-year third quarter and fourth quarter decline in carload units seems realistic. What's your volume view? Image Sourced From Pixabay"
2019-08-01,Blackjewel Bankruptcy Could Set Off Ripple Effects For Freight Rail,"Going on 16 hours here in Cumberland. Overnight these guys got a megaphone, about 10 pizzas, and some big boy juice. The #blackjewel coal train still hasn't left. pic.twitter.com/cZ9hsV1RDH — Sydney Boles (@sydneyboles) July 30, 2019 The bankruptcy of private coal company Blackjewel could result in ripple effects across the freight rail industry. There was an immediate impact. On July 29, frustrated coal miners began blocking a CSX (NYSE:CSX) train in response to Blackjewel's stalled mine operations and weeks without pay. However, Blackjewel's bankruptcy also reminded the broader industrial sector of the vulnerability of U.S. coal production overall, particularly so for western U.S. coal production. That's because Blackjewel not only owns Central Appalachian mines but two of the biggest mines in the Powder River Basin (PRB). As a result, one lingering question will be how and if western rail movements will be affected by a possible slow decline in western coal production, just as CSX and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) were affected by declines in Appalachian coal production. Blackjewel, which has assets in Wyoming and the Central Appalachian coal-producing states of Kentucky and West Virginia, declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 1, according to filings submitted to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. As a result of the bankruptcy, Blackjewel's mines abruptly closed, and there are reports that some workers have gone without pay for weeks. In response, on July 29, a number of miners in Harlan County, Kentucky, where some of Blackjewel's mines are located, began blocking a CSX train carrying coal from continuing on its route. The miners said they were not moving until they got paid by Blackjewel. Late on July 31, the miners agreed to allow CSX retrieve its locomotives while leaving the coal cars on the tracks. But the miners' protest is still ongoing. CSX said, Following productive discussions with local stakeholders, the demonstrators agreed to briefly withdraw, allowing a CSX crew to safely retrieve two locomotives from the blocked coal train so that we could continue serving other customers. We continue to monitor the situation and are hopeful that a quick resolution can be reached. Blackjewel's parent company, West Virginia-based Revelation Energy, did not respond to a request for comment. But state and local leaders have been voicing their support of the miners. I fully support the miners. Blackjewel failed to pay them for weeks of hard work and the way they filed for bankruptcy prevents miners from accessing their 401Ks, making it even harder for them to feed their families during this trying time, said Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear. While the miners' plight in Kentucky has garnered national media attention in recent days, other miners in other states who were also employed by Blackjewel are facing similar questions about their job prospects. In addition to Blackjewel's bankruptcy, parent Revelation Energy also declared bankruptcy on July 1. Revelation Energy was the sixth-largest U.S. coal producer in 2017, with output of 37.8 million short tons, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Blackjewel and the Powder River Basin Blackjewel's bankruptcy also resulted in the closure of two of its mines in Wyoming, the Belle Ayr mine and the Eagle Butte mine. These two mines, located in the PRB, are among the largest coal-producing mines nationally. The Eagle Butte mine ranked fourth among the top producing U.S. coal mines in 2017, with output at nearly 17.3 million short tons, according to the EIA. The Belle Ayr mine ranked sixth in 2017 and produced 15.8 million short tons. Diana and I were devastated to learn about the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines' layoffs. We send our heartfelt sympathies to everyone impacted by this horrible news. This kind of unexpected, mass layoff does not benefit anyone. It immediately affects our families, friends and neighbors in very real ways. It ripples through our communities, our state and our economy, said U.S. Senator Mike Enzi (R-Wyoming) on July 2. Although the Wyoming mines remain closed, they could potentially reopen because the bankruptcy court has agreed to allow the mines to be sold. Tennessee-based Contura Energy is a potential buyer for the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines, as well as a metallurgical coal mine in Fayette County, West Virginia, Contura said on July 25. Contura's divestment of these PRB assets over a year and a half ago was a strategic decision to focus on our met[allurgical]-heavy eastern asset base, and while that remains our strategic focus, our considerations changed when Blackjewel declared bankruptcy, said Andy Eidson, interim co-chief executive officer of Contura Energy. Absent another qualified purchaser for the assets, we have determined that the most prudent path forward is to reacquire these mines to reestablish operations, resume safe and responsible coal production, and bring hundreds of miners back to work. The Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines served the domestic and international coal markets, according to Javelin Global Commodities, a company that had formed a sales and marketing joint venture with Blackjewel. The joint venture exported PRB coal out of the Gulf Coast, according to Javelin's website. Javelin was unavailable for comment about the bankruptcy. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and BNSF (NYSE:BRK) handle coal from the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines. Union Pacific was unavailable for comment by press time on Blackjewel's bankruptcy, while BNSF declined to comment. As U.S. coal production dwindles, what does that mean for freight rail? Although the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines could potentially reopen in the coming weeks, the bankruptcy of Blackjewel and the May 2019 Chapter 11 bankruptcy of western coal producer Cloud Peak Energy are reminders that coal production in the western U.S. is not immune to the overall systemic decline in U.S. coal production and consumption. Over the past several months, Cloud Peak Energy has thoroughly evaluated strategic alternatives to address the challenging market conditions in our industry. We believe, at this time, that a sale process in Chapter 11 will provide the best opportunity to maximize value for Cloud Peak Energy, Colin Marshall, the company's chief executive officer, said in May. Indeed, U.S. coal production has fallen from 1.15 billion short tons in 2007 to 774.6 million short tons in 2017, according to the EIA. U.S. coal production peaked at 1.17 billion short tons in 2008, but it has been declining since then despite an uptick in 2014. In the EIA's latest Short-Term Energy Outlook released on July 9, it forecasted U.S. coal production to fall by 72 million short tons, or 9 percent, in 2019 to 684 million short tons, which would be the first time U.S. production would be less than 700 million short tons in more than 40 years. Near-term signals also affirm coal's systemic decline. U.S. coal exports have been falling as Europe switches to natural gas. Meanwhile, U.S. carloads of coal are down 6 percent year-to-date compared to the period in 2018, according to the Association of American Railroads. U.S. coal carloads totaled 2.3 million carloads for the week ending July 27. U.S. coal production has been declining over the last several years, in large part because power companies have been opting to use more natural gas and less coal to help produce electricity. Appalachian coal could not compete with cheap natural gas prices, and as a result, coal production has fallen in states such as Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia, while the freight railroads serving those companies, CSX and NSC have been evaluating shedding portions of their network that had run mostly coal trains. Coal produced in the Illinois Basin and the Powder River Basin hasn't been as affected, in part because the coal coming from those mines in the western U.S. generally costs less. Coal produced in the western states also has a lower heating value. But that dynamic could be changing. Cheap natural gas from Texas and the push to use more renewable energy sources are starting to displace coal at more utilities in the Midwest and in western states. While Appalachian coal production is expected to fall by 7 percent this year on lower export demand, coal production in the interior U.S. is projected to fall 6 percent and western coal production is anticipated to fall 12 percent because of lower domestic consumption, according to the EIA's Short-Term Energy Outlook. Source: Energy Information Administration The EIA also reported in a July 1 quarterly coal outlook that western coal production fell 8.8 percent, to 94.5 million short tons in the first quarter of 2019 compared with 103.7 million short tons in the same period in 2018. Of that, PRB production fell 12.9 percent to 70.4 million short tons from 80.8 million short tons. Source: Energy Information Administration FreightWaves Market Voices expert Jim Blaze talked about a projected decline in PRB production in June. Here is a closer look at the PRB coal market. Approximately 130 power stations in the U.S. bought PRB coal in 2018 – from just 16 PRB mines. A decade earlier that customer base was about 200 users, spread over 23 states. That's a significant decline of about 35 percent, Blaze said in June. Failure to find new markets will likely result in a slow reduction towards 300 million or fewer tons mined annually in the coming five years. Coal companies are responding to coal's decline by consolidating operations. In June, major U.S. coal producers Peabody Energy (NYSE:BTU) and Arch Coal (NYSE:ACI) said they were combining their PRB and Colorado assets as a means to shore up their operations amidst challenging headwinds. This combination is aimed at unlocking extraordinary synergies and creating exceptional value for customers and shareholders, by strengthening the competitiveness of coal against natural gas and renewables, BTU chief executive officer Glenn Kellow said during his company's second quarter earnings call on July 31. If mines close and operations consolidate in the western U.S. as a result, one ongoing question is whether the freight trains serving the western coal mines will find themselves facing the same situation CSX and NSC faced when mines in central Appalachia shut down. In recent years, CSX and NSC have divested or continue to evaluate some of the track and rail assets that served primarily coal mines and coal preparation plants. Some eastern lines are now possible stranded assets because tonnage on coal-served lines fell with the drop of coal, making those lines less valuable on a revenue per ton mile basis, Blaze told FreightWaves. I'd expect a future sell-off of some of these Class I rail company lines to short line railroads, he said. The eastern railroads also have been monitoring Appalachian coal production for two decades, and they have been seeking alternatives to compensate for the impending lost revenue from coal, Blaze said. Meanwhile, the stranded assets in the western U.S. could be the lines running east and west, Blaze said. Potential coal exports are facing local opposition in the Pacific Northwest, while the decline in U.S. coal-fired generation could soften western coal volumes heading eastward via Chicago, he said. There are really some really interesting things that are occurring, but it's going to be different by geography. Stranded assets could occur in some lanes but not in all of them, Blaze said. The other kind of stranded assets, according to Blaze, are locomotives and coal gondolas and coal open top hoppers. How the decline in coal production in the western U.S. will play out for freight rail movements in the western U.S. could take years to discern. But in the near-term, UNP said earlier this year that it expects coal to see the same challenges in 2019 as it has seen in previous years. We expect coal to experience continued headwinds throughout 2019, Kenny Rocker, UNP's senior vice president for sales and marketing, said during UNP's first quarter earnings call in January 2019. A quarter later, the company reported that its coal and coke volume was down by 7 percent in the second quarter of 2019, driven by the ongoing headwinds of contract changes and the retirement of coal-fired units at power plants. Coal exports were also lower because of softer market conditions. Image sourced from Pixabay"

2019-08-15,North American Rail Volumes Continue Downward Trend,"North American year-to-date rail volumes drafted lower again for the week ending August 14, according to the Association of American Railroads. Rail traffic slumped in the U.S. and Mexico but rose in Canada when comparing volumes to the same period in 2018. Overall North American rail traffic fell 2.3 percent year-to-date to 22.6 million carloads and intermodal units. Of that total, carloads fell 2 percent to nearly 11.4 million carloads, while intermodal units fell 2.6 percent to 11.3 million intermodal containers and trailers. By country, total Canadian rail volumes were up 2 percent to 4.8 million carloads and intermodal units, while Mexcian rail volumes were down 3.3 percent to 1.2 million carloads and intermodal units. Meanwhile, U.S. rail volumes, which consist of about 73 percent of total North American rail traffic, were down 3.5 percent year-to-date to 16.6 million carloads and intermodal units. Of that, U.S. carloads fell 3.2 percent to 8.1 million, while U.S. intermodal units dropped 3.7 percent to 8.5 million. Some rail industry observers expect U.S. rail volumes to be flat or down in the second half of the year compared to the same period in 2018 because of factors such as U.S. trade uncertainty, a competitive truck market and some lingering shippers' concerns about rail service. But signals remain mixed about the U.S. economy, which can in turn influence demand for freight transportation. Media reports on August 14 spoke of an indicator signaling a potential U.S. recession. The inverted yield curve, which happens when interest rates for U.S. Treasury short-term bonds are higher than long-term bonds, occurred briefly on the 15th, resulting in the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 800 points and stoking concerns that a recession is looming. However, trucking demand appears to be rising on the West Coast, albeit at the expense of rail intermodal. But even rail intermodal could see demand grow in certain regions in the second half of the year, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) alluded last month. We've got the most powerful Intermodal franchise in the east, which is married to the consumption part of the U.S. economy and the economy continues to move in the direction of the consumer, and the consumer-related economic indicators are still relatively strong. We've got a diverse merchandise franchise, which offers many opportunities for growth in the second half of the year, NSC chief marketing officer Alan Shaw said during his company's second quarter earnings call on July 24. He continued, Our intermodal franchise outlook is very consistent with what we're hearing from our channel partners. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-08-20,Employee Levels At U.S. Class I Rail Operations Drop,"The U.S. operations of the Class I railroads had fewer employees on their company rosters in July, continuing a downward trend that has been going on for years. In mid-July, headcount totaled 140,703 employees at U.S. Class I rail operations, according to data compiled by the Surface Transportation Board. U.S. rail headcount fell 4.6 percent from July 2018, and nearly 0.5 percent from June 2019. The headcount of train and engine employees totaled 59,291 workers in mid-July, a 4.2 percent drop from July 2018. July's numbers for train and engine employees was nearly flat with June, shedding only 0.1 percent, or 72 employees month-over-month. The headcount for train and engine employees can be significant because it can signal the level of train crews that the railroads think they need to keep network capacity at an adequate level. The totals for both categories are the lowest so far for 2019. Overall employee levels have dropped in 2019 as Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) joined CSX (NYSE:CSX), Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) and Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) in adopting precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operational model that seeks to streamline operations and run trains on a fixed schedule. The railroads also traditionally seek to match resources, including train crews, with anticipated capacity needs, and U.S. rail volumes year-to-date have been sluggish in 2019. When volumes get softer, we know how to adjust our resources to match what volume represents, said UNP chief executive officer Lance Fritz during his company's second quarter earnings call on July 18. Fritz also said his company's adoption of PSR was a key contributor to UNP's year-over-year drop in headcount. Fritz continued, We've taken a lot of work out of the network and it's being reflected now in our manpower. The Class I railroads said last month that they will continue to look at headcount levels, with some companies continuing to pursue cuts as they implement PSR. We aren't guiding to a specific headcount number, but as I mentioned previously, we do expect that headcount is going to continue to come down as we reduce work associated with TOP21 [NSC's version of PSR], said NSC chief financial officer Cindy Earhart during her company second quarter earnings call in July. We're going to be looking at all areas of the company – mechanical, G&A [general and administrative] – all of those areas as we continue to push on the productivity. Image Sourced from Google"
2019-08-27,Commentary: Is Intermodal Rail Stalling?,"FreightWaves features Market Voices – a forum for voices with unique knowledge of numerous transportation/logistics/supply chain sectors, as well as other critical expertise. As a transportation mode choice, where is intermodal rail heading? Author's note – this is not a financial analysis to help determine whether to buy or sell railroad stock. This is about the evolving role of rail intermodal service in a market that is dominated by trucks, whose share of volume dwarfs rail. Over several decades the premise was that railroad intermodal trailer on flat cars (TOFC) and containers mostly on doublestacked well cars (COFC) would grow in volume and therefore reduce highway truck congestion. Data courtesy of IANA and TTX. From materials presented in registered forum August 2019. Yes, rail intermodal has grown – and at a pace mostly above the growth rate of the nation's gross domestic product. But the commercial message sent by the railroads has largely focused upon the financial earnings and the success of railroad company yield management using their so-called precision scheduled railroading (PSR) business model. As one example, CSX (NYSE:CSX) proudly states that CSX has more pricing power [now]…particularly in intermodal truck-rail business… according to Wall Street Journal business editor Paul Page (October 2018). However, on a volume and market share basis, changes in CSX's origin-destination intermodal services have resulted in weakness in CSX's second-quarter intermodal volume. The company reported a 10 percent drop year-over-year in intermodal volume. CSX also reported an 11 percent drop in intermodal revenue for the quarter. Beyond this one eastern railroad, mid-August 2019 U.S. rail total carload and intermodal volumes were down 3.5 percent year-to-date to 16.6 million units. Of that, U.S. carloads fell 3.2 percent to 8.1 million, while U.S. intermodal units dropped 3.7 percent to 8.5 million. Not everyone is negative about rail intermodal. In the eastern states, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) executives remain optimistic. They stated in mid-July that Norfolk Southern's rail intermodal could see demand grow in certain service lanes during the second half of this year. We've got the most powerful intermodal franchise in the east, which is married to the consumption part of the U.S. economy and the economy continues to move in the direction of the consumer, and the consumer-related economic indicators are still relatively strong. We've got a diverse merchandise franchise, which offers many opportunities for growth in the second half of the year, NSC chief marketing officer Alan Shaw said during his company's second quarter earnings call on July 24. The Norfolk Southern logic is that some of their intermodal customers (channel partners) support that second half intermodal market outlook. Financially, as Wall Street Journal reporter Lauren Silva Laughlin wrote on August 23rd, PSR execution so far has been good for shareholders of North America's freight railroads including Canadian National, Canadian Pacific, CSX, Kansas City Southern, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific. Yet, here is the market share and growth ‘rub.' Financials aside, unit volume is not growing at the rate once expected in intermodal trailers/containers. Data courtesy of IANA and TTX from materials presented in registered forum August 2019. The U.S. rail freight sector remains at about 10 percent or less of total surface freight by mode by shipper payments billed versus trucking and other freight modes. The rail industry position is that rail pricing and rail freight dependability have improved greatly since the passage of the 1980 Staggers Act (which deregulated the U.S. railroad industry). There is no question of that improvement based upon the statistical evidence. But as the old saying is, what have you done lately? The American Association of Railroads is correct that intermodal rail has benefited rail customers with competitive rates and unmatched efficiency of scale. True, average rail rates have fallen 46 percent since 1981 — allowing most rail shippers to move nearly twice as much freight for the same price paid more than 30 years ago. However, recently railroad prices have been increasing. Some prices are increasing much faster than nominal inflation. Meanwhile, the hope of diverting millions of trucks annually from the congested eastern interstates and primary U.S. highways isn't quite playing out as once expected. Why? In large part because the average distance that most of the trucks moving between markets in the eastern states are in the 250 to 500-mile range – and are not ripe for rail conversion. No American railroad has achieved a sustainable high margin profit intermodal service over such short distances. Moreover, the PSR model with its long trains doesn't match that geographic opportunity. Further, the railroads still lack a rapid load-on/load-off rail car platform to capture the dominant roadway traffic we call semi-trailers. Flats, tankers and similar big rig semis just don't fit onto the very low cost per operated mile doublestacked well rail cars. Statistically, the movement of trailers on rail flat cars is a disappearing market segment. A recent conference sponsored by the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA) and TTX Company gave the industry an interesting profile of where intermodal is this year. The patterns they revealed were these: Trailer on Flat Car continues to decline as a rail intermodal service: Four of the past 11 years back to 2009 saw declines in TOFC volume. Two of those years saw volume drops of more than 20 percent. Only two years provided a relatively high 10 percent to 11 percent increase in year-over-year growth. The period 2011 to 2015 witnessed a low 1.6 percent to 2.9 percent increase, spaced between 5.3 percent and 9.7 percent declines. What used to be ~3 million TOFC units more than a decade ago is now trending to ~ 1.2 million annually. No one disputes this trailer pattern. Yet most of the traffic units out on the highways remain the semis. Rail management doesn't have a mechanical engineering solution to grab this market. Does anyone dispute this? In contrast, stackable containers are the dominant domestic intermodal service. The cost per mile to move a 53-footer on a stack container car is about 40 percent to just 60 percent per mile moved of a similar trailer or container chassis moved on the road. That's the internal railroading business cost. That's not the price charged. The railroads have been clearly documenting in their periodic investor reports that they are using pricing leverage to increase their intermodal margin. They are getting greater earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by not growing volume under the PSR model. Instead, they are increasing their prices against trucking prices in strategic lanes. What happened to the railroads' plan to grow by taking domestic share? Domestic rail container units used to grow at a respectable 9.6 percent to as much as 14.7 percent year- over-year pace between 2009 and 2013. After 2013 this growth rate dropped to about a 4.5 percent average. 2017 was up by only 2.7 percent over 2016. So far in 2019 the rate is down about 6 percent. Because of the huge trucking base share, rail intermodal must gain at near double-digit pace to take highway share. International intermodal container movement patterns are a bit different: International intermodal units have been growing year-over-year at a more stable range of about 4.5 percent to nearly 7 percent year-over-year until the trade dispute started. Now it's dropped to a mere 1.4 percent pace to-date in 2019. The future is at best unclear. This railroader's interpretation is that, based upon the current evidence, far less intermodal highway to railway shifting will occur than was formerly expected unless something in the railroad intermodal business model changes. Or truck capacity drops. Driver shortages for trucking will likely continue. This will include shortages of drivers in the short-haul lanes and the drayage markets. Railroads don't have a solution to combat either the short-haul or the drayage shortages. Acknowledgements: The following are credited with interesting facts and observations. However, they might disagree with some of my data interpretation: Melissa Peralta – Senior Economist – TTX Company Peter Wolf and John Woodcock as recent IANA speakers Technical observations shared by experts like Larry Gross and FTR's Eric Starks.

2019-08-28,OmniTRAX Acquires Shortline Railroad Assets In Northern Ohio,"OmniTRAX is acquiring shortline railroad assets in northern Ohio, enabling the privately held company to expand its access to the Port of Cleveland. An OmniTRAX affiliate and an affiliate of the Broe Group have agreed to acquire the Cleveland Commercial Railroad Group (CCRL) and its subsidiary, Cleveland Harbor Belt Railroad (CHB). Following the acquisition, CCRL will be renamed the Cleveland & Cuyahoga Railway, while CHB will be renamed the Cleveland Port Railway. The two rail assets ship primarily steel, scrap metals, grain and chemicals. CCRL, which operates on 35 miles of track in northern Ohio, interchanges with Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and the Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway. CHB, which manages the Port of Cleveland's rail switching service, interchanges with NSC and CSX (NYSE:CSX). We look forward to working with the Port of Cleveland and are confident our partnership will lead to significant growth in both marine and rail activity, said OmniTRAX chief executive officer Kevin Shuba. We expect the partnership with the Port of Cleveland will be another example of the success OmniTRAX and its partners have achieved when rail and maritime work together. The price of the transaction, which is expected to close in late August, was not disclosed. The Port of Cleveland is excited to partner with OmniTRAX and further build out the on-dock rail business at our general docks, said David Gutheil, chief commercial officer at the Port of Cleveland. OmniTRAX has a substantial customer base across their existing network and a history of leveraging their strong partnerships with the Class I railroads to increase revenues and find new lines of business. The acquisition will join other Ohio assets owned by OmniTRAX, including the Newburgh & South Shore Railroad in Cleveland and the Northern Ohio and Western Railway in Toledo. Both these assets serve the Midwest and Great Lakes. The transaction follows another acquisition OmniTRAX made last month. The company said it was acquiring the Winchester & Western Railroad (WW) from Covia Holdings (NYSE:CVIA) for $105 million. The deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of 2019 pending review from the Surface Transportation Board, would expand the OmniTRAX's portfolio to include key new distribution markets in multiple East Coast markets as a result of WW's operations in Maryland, New Jersey, Virginia and West Virginia, the company said on July 26. OmniTRAX currently operates 20 shortline railroads, according to its website. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-08-29,"Greenbrier, CSX And Norfolk Southern Announce Executive Appointments","Railcar manufacturer Greenbrier (NYSE:GBX) and eastern U.S. railroads CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) are adding some new faces to executive roles. The changes come as freight railroads implement precision scheduled railroading, an operational model that seeks to streamline operations by moving railcars on a fixed schedule, and grapple with continued competition from the truck market. Greenbrier Railcar manufacturer GBX has promoted Lorie Tekorius to president and chief operating officer, the company said on August 29. Tekorius, who served most recently as the company's chief operating officer as well as its chief financial officer, will oversee several GBX divisions, including strategic planning, the repair and parts business unit and other company departments such as global corporate health, safety and security, accounting, finance and human resources. She will also continue to oversee the commercial, manufacturing and international business units. The promotion announced today demonstrates Greenbrier's emphasis on growing from within as we continue to plan our future. In her enhanced role, Lorie will continue to focus on teamwork across our organization in pursuit of shared missions and objectives as the path to sustainable long-term success and shareholder value, said GBX chief executive officer Bill Furman. Rail equipment analyst Matt Elkott with investment firm Cowen sees the promotion as indicative of chief executive officer succession plans for the future. Ms. Tekorius tends to be relatively conservative in her outlook commentary on conference calls and in presentations, something that could bode well for establishing a solid track record of earnings guidance, Elkott said in an August 29 note. Norfolk Southern Marc George will become executive vice president and chief financial officer on November 1 for NSC, replacing Cindy Earhart, who is retiring from the company. George served at United Technologies (NYSE:UTX), where he spent more than 30 years. Most recently he was the vice president of finance and chief financial at Carrier Corporation, a segment at UTX. George also held similar positions at Otis Elevator Company, another UTX segment. Mark's strong financial management skills and operational insight will enhance Norfolk Southern's focus on productivity and cost control, said NSC chief executive officer Jim Squires. Honed by experience across multiple industrial segments, Mark's business acumen aligns perfectly with our vision of superior customer service, increased efficiency and continued growth. Squires also said, On behalf of the entire board and management team, I thank Cindy for her 34 years of service to Norfolk Southern. I have valued the critical role Cindy played in the development of our strategic plan and her support in delivering superior shareholder returns. Earlier this month, NSC also announced two new appointments, effective immediately. Michael Farrell became senior vice president for operations and mechanical, while Vanessa Allen Sutherland became senior vice president of government relations and chief legal officer. In this expanded role, Mike brings the energy and operational insights that have, in less than a year, transformed our transportation performance, and applies them to our mechanical functions, said Mike Wheeler, NSC executive vice president and chief operating officer. Mike's determination and proven approach will extract the same efficiencies in fuel consumption, fleet management – and across our operations – that he and his teams have already realized in equipment utilization and train operations. Of Allen Sutherland, Squires said, Constructive, informed and collaborative legal and regulatory environments are essential to Norfolk Southern's success. Vanessa's experience in corporate law – both at Norfolk Southern and elsewhere – enables her to protect and progress our positions across our business. He continued, Likewise, Vanessa's understanding of government and community expectations and processes – honed during her tenure as the head of a federal agency – positions her to foster and deepen the dialogue that leads to innovation for the safety and prosperity of NS, our customers and shareholders, and the communities we serve. Squires was referring to Allen Sutherland's former roles as chief executive officer of the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board and chief counsel of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. CSX Energy research pro Adam Longston is joining CSX's sales and marketing team as its vice president of energy on September 9. Longston will be responsible for CSX's energy portfolio, which includes export and domestic utility coal, liquefied petroleum gas and crude oil. He was most recently the director of research and hedging at Continental Resources, and he was also head of commodity research at Madava Asset Management. He served two roles at Morgan Stanley as global head of energy commodity research and vice president of equity research for freight transportation, and he was a senior strategy analyst at British Petroleum. Adam's deep knowledge of the energy and transportation industries will be a great asset for CSX, as we continue to engage in more strategic and analytical approaches to generating growth and long-term success for the business, said Mark Wallace, CSX executive vice president for sales and marketing.

2019-09-04,CSX And Norfolk Southern Ready Themselves For Dorian,"Eastern Class I railroads CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) say customers should expect service delays this week as Hurricane Dorian brings heavy rains and strong winds to the southeastern coast of the U.S. CSX expects Dorian to impact portions of CSX's network over the next three days, including Florida on September 3 and 4 and Georgia and the Carolinas on September 4 and 5. The company said customers could experience delays or rerouting during this time. Meanwhile, NSC intermodal shipments are barred from entering the gates of intermodal origin facilities in Savannah, Georgia, Charleston, South Carolina, and destinations along eastern Florida. FreightWaves reported earlier today that a number of ports have closed in advance of the hurricane's arrival. NSC has staged equipment and materials in key areas, and the railroad will begin recovery efforts as soon as it is safe to do so, the company said. Customers that have shipments that originate or are destined for the southeastern U.S. should expect traffic delays, NSC said. A SONAR map showing Hurricane Dorian nearing Florida. The lines indicate the network locations of four freight railroads: CSX, Norfolk Southern, Genesee & Wyoming and Florida East Coast Railway. Dorian, currently a Category 2 hurricane, has been slow moving, and so its path has been hard to predict. However, forecasts are now calling for Dorian to move northwest, potentially avoiding landfall in the U.S. except for potentially North Carolina (see video: https://www.freightwaves.com/news/hurricane-dorian-inching-closer-to-us-forecast-video).

2019-09-04,Railroads See Headwinds Cutting Volumes For Rest Of 2019,"Loose truck capacity, trade uncertainty and lower coal demand are among the headwinds that some Class I railroads are seeing for the remainder of 2019. These expectations have led Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) to lower its volume guidance for the second half of 2019. The railroad now expects rail volume in the second half of 2019 to be down mid-single digits compared with the second half of 2019, UNP chief financial officer Rob Knight said at the Cowen & Company annual transportation conference Sept. 4. Quarter-to-date volumes in the third quarter are down 7% from the same period in 2018, Knight said. Trade uncertainty between the U.S. and China has resulted in lower grain volumes for UNP, particularly for soybeans, as well as lower international intermodal volumes, said UNP senior vice president for sales and marketing Kenny Rocker. We're expecting a very compressed peak season, but we're still expecting one and so we'll see how that plays out, Rocker said. Despite the lower volume projections, UNP still expects to meet its goal of a sub-61% operating ratio for 2019 because of cost-cutting measures that resulted from implementing precision scheduled railroading, an operating model that seeks to streamline operations and train schedules. A lower operating ratio implies greater company profitability. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) also noted softer volumes in the third quarter, followed by flat volumes in the fourth quarter. While coal volumes could be lower in the fourth quarter because of softening demand for thermal and metallurgical coal, the peak season uplift and stable automotive volumes could result in flat year-over-year comparisons, according to NSC chief marketing officer Alan Shaw. The peak season for 2019 will be similar to the one for 2017 because some of the underlying macroeconomic factors related to labor and gross domestic product are still strong, Shaw said. But even if trade uncertainty clears up and some markets bounce back quickly because of pent-up demand, there is still some market weakness in Europe that could dampen market expectations for the remainder of 2019, Shaw said. Meanwhile, Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) also alluded to short-term clouds, such as slumping coal demand, that contributed to the company's decision to start rightsizing its assets in the second quarter in order to better match rail capacity with demand. For example, lumber production is facing a systemic decline in British Columbia, resulting in CNI returning the 1,000 center-beam cars that it had leased, according to CNI chief financial officer Ghsilain Houle. The place we have to be careful [in rightsizing] is for crews because it can be hard to hire workers in some locations, Houle said, but CNI can be more aggressive in cutting costs through using fewer railcars. We can cut costs, but we have to be careful and mindful that cycles come and go, Houle said. Meanwhile, the requirement that trucks employing electronic logging devices in Canada in 2020 should be good for rail intermodal because the ELD mandate puts pressure on trucking capacity, Houle said. While trade uncertainty was a looming headwind for UNP, NSC and CNI, Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) said its cross-border franchise with Mexico has helped to reduce its exposure to strained U.S.-China trade relations. The company actually seeks Mexico as a potential beneficiary of the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China because companies are eyeing foreign investment opportunities in Mexico, according to KSU chief marketing officer Mike Naatz. Naatz also was confident that the U.S., Mexico and Canada will produce a trade agreement soon to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Image Sourced from Google"
2019-09-04,"J.B. Hunt Provides Some Optimism, Less Doom At Investor Conference","J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (NASDAQ:JBHT) provided constructive commentary on intermodal and truckload (TL) fundamentals during a presentation at the Cowen and Company 12th Annual Global Transportation Conference. The outlook from the surface transportation services giant at the intra-third quarter event was notably better than the concern around the lack of an uptick in seasonal demand that many carriers expressed at multiple investor conferences in May and June. Executive Vice President of Intermodal Services Darren Field and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations Brad Delco were on hand to answer questions about the company and the industry. Field said that freight volumes are not great but that the negative trendline seen at the beginning of the year has stabilized. The company had some concerns around lower demand in the first quarter and into the second quarter, but said that seasonality in demand has returned. Freight demand improved sequentially in May and June. Further, the company said that July and August were as expected and that their customers' expectations are that there will be a normal peak season in 2019. However, Field said that the economy is not great and that none of JBHT's customers have indicated capacity concerns regarding special projects. These inquiries are fairly common in a tighter truck capacity environment. Field went on to say that the [economy] has bumped up on the bottom and now things will sort of feel maybe more normal as we move forward. On concerns of tariff increases and trade tensions, Field said that JBHT hasn't had any of its customers change capacity needs with respect to trade concerns. None of JBHT's customers have approached the carrier with the intention of reducing capacity needs due to the threat of tariffs. Further, no shipper has told them that they plan to pull forward inventory, similar to the practice many shippers employed ahead of 2018's tariff announcements, requiring additional equipment. Field said that they haven't seen any material changes to customer supply chains in response to trade talks, but noted that they would be foolish to think that this isn't occurring somewhat. When asked about the negative impact TL spot pricing was having on intermodal demand, Field said that JBHT does not have much spot intermodal exposure (only 2 percent to 5 percent). He said that in tighter TL markets demand often overflows to intermodal service, especially with some of its clients that have container pools already at their location. Usually this incremental freight would move via intermodal. That type of intermodal demand isn't there this year, especially in the East, where low-cost spot TL capacity is readily available. Additionally, he believes that lower TL spot market prices are creating the expectation that intermodal pricing could be lower next year. Field said that precision scheduled railroading (PSR) has been a little bit of a mixed bag on intermodal demand. At times, communication from the railroads hasn't kept pace with the rate of change seen in some lanes of service. This has caused headaches with shippers using intermodal service. Both of JBHT's eastern railroad partners, CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), have notably improved service recently, but Field questioned whether this was due to PSR-related efforts or lower carloads. He said the real test will come when demand improves, TL capacity tightens and rail carloads move higher. Field believes that a consistent rail service product is required to capture incremental intermodal demand. RTOICY.USA – SONAR Brad Delco provided an update regarding J.B. Hunt 360, a digital marketplace for carriers and shippers to match loads. Delco said that the offering was initially created in response to demands from its customers. The load-matching service provides greater visibility to the market and JBHT has seen improved execution through this automation. The company has focused on the carrier side of the offering thus far, but has plans to improve the shipper side of the service moving forward. JBHT's brokerage business has been in existence for a decade with roughly 30,000 carriers. Since the 2017 launch of the service, another 30,000 carriers have been added. Management said that they have a strong dedicated pipeline, 70 percent of which comes from potential private fleet conversions. A private fleet is not for-hire and is typically operated by a company to deliver its core goods or services. JBHT converts many of these fleets to its dedicated contract carriage service wherein it owns and operates the equipment under the converted fleets' brand. Delco said that the pipeline to sales process for private fleet conversions is closer to 24 months currently, up from 18 months historically. Delco said nothing specifically is driving the increase, but there isn't as much urgency to convert currently because truck capacity is looser and the driver market is less challenging. JBHT continues to look for final-mile opportunities even though some of its competitors have dropped this offering. Delco said that they believe the total addressable market for final-mile is $12 billion to $15 billion. JBHT sees approximately $550 million from its final-mile offering and will begin to report the financials from this business separately beginning in the first quarter of 2020. Going forward, JBHT is seeking asset-light acquisition opportunities in the space. They like the asset-light or pool distribution approach versus adding more trucks like they have in the past. JBHT isn't ready to make a call on the 2020 TL market yet. The company saw seasonality return in the second quarter, but senior management is not ready to call it a full-on freight recovery. Not as bad as it was is the way Delco described the recent rate of change in the TL market. Lastly, the Field said that they don't really have a comment regarding reports that the company implemented peak-season surcharges to recoup the cost of moving empty intermodal containers back to the West Coast. They said that each customer's contract is individually negotiated and that they don't have a blanket accessorial program with customers. JBHT Stock Chart – SONAR Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-09-06,US Railroads Could Face Billions In Losses As Coal Demand Slumps,"The systemic decline in U.S. coal production could cost U.S. freight railroads as much as $5 billion, according to a report produced by market ratings firm Moody's Investment Service. As coal demand from utilities drops by more than 50 percent by 2030, U.S. railroads could see an estimated $5 billion in lost revenue, which constitutes about 5.5 percent of 2018 industry revenue, Moody's said in a September 4 report. But if that decline is gradual, such as a thermal coal decline of about 7 percent per year between now and 2030, then the resulting credit impacts to the railroads will be manageable, Moody's said. U.S. coal consumption is declining because cheap natural gas prices are competing against coal as a generating fuel. Federal mandates for air emissions have also resulted in utilities seeking other fuel sources for power generation. Source: SONAR As a result of the power sector's declining demand for U.S. thermal coal, major coal-producing regions are likely to see lower production levels. Appalachian coal production has already fallen in the eastern U.S., affecting railroads such as CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). But railroads that deliver coal from the Powder River Basin (PRB) in the western U.S. are likely to be more exposed to weakening coal demand, including BNSF (NYSE:BRK) and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), Moody's said. PRB coal has a lower heat content than other coal types and its low-sulfur content is less advantageous after utilities were mandated to install scrubbers to reduce emissions of sulfur oxides, Moody's said. Export opportunities of PRB coal are also constrained in view of opposition to proposals for coal export facilities at port locations in the Pacific Northwest, a social risk reflecting growing concerns about the emission of carbon dioxide and pollutants from coal. Source: SONAR The railroads and coal producers might find some relief in export coal, but the export coal market can be volatile because of the cost structures involved in exporting coal overseas. European demand for thermal and metallurgical coal could also decline as well in the coming years. Higher cost structures – including incorporating transportation costs to overseas markets – hinder U.S. exporters of thermal and metallurgical coal to compete effectively in seaborne markets, in particular when prices are low, Moody's said. Railroads have shown a willingness to lower rail transportation costs for export coal when prices are low to help U.S. producers compete with overseas suppliers. U.S. railroads might also seek to grow their intermodal volumes to cushion the lost revenue from coal, Moody's said. The recent implementation by most U.S. railroads of operating models based on principles of precision scheduled railroading (PSR) appears to improve rail service levels – including on-time delivery – which is critical for intermodal freight. Intermodal freight tends to be more time-sensitive and demand more frequent service. Sustainable improvement of service levels would help to compete against over-the-road transportation by truck carriers, Moody's said. As coal production faces a probable decline, the railroads will need to assess what to do with the portions of their networks that handle coal deliveries. Their options include seeking other freight that could run on the coal lines, selling the coal lines or abandoning them, Moody's said. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-09-06,"Dorian Expected To Cause Delays For CSX, Norfolk Southern","Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and CSX (NYSE:CSX) are telling customers to expect continuing delays as Hurricane Dorian travels up the East Coast. Hurricane Dorian, which was a Category 1 hurricane Sept. 6 after strengthening earlier this week to a Category 3 hurricane (see video: https://youtu.be/mQe9bNkZ2gI) has been hugging the coasts of the Carolinas, making landfall at Cape Hatteras and bringing risks of storm surges inland. The hurricane has disrupted the supply chain along the eastern U.S. all week. Traffic destined to or shipping from the affected areas may experience some delay. As the storm progresses north, traffic patterns are stabilizing in Florida and southern Georgia, NSC said in a Sept. 5 service update. The railroad also said its intermodal terminals are now accepting traffic destined to Florida, and it would open the gates on Sept. 6 for traffic destined to the ports of Charleston and Savannah. Norfolk Southern also said it has staged equipment and materials in key areas and will begin recovery activities as soon as it is safe to do so. CSX said it expects Dorian to impact portions of the CSX network in the Northeast on Sept. 6. Delays and reroutings are happening through impacted areas of Georgia and the Carolinas. The railroads said intermodal customers should refer to the real-time service advisories for intermodal-specific operational actions. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-09-12,US Rail Volumes Still Sluggish,"Year-to-date U.S. rail volumes fell yet again for the week ending Sept. 7, according to the latest data from the Association of American Railroads. Compared with the same period in 2018, year-to-date U.S. rail volumes were 3.7% lower at 18.67 million carloads and intermodal units. Of that, U.S. carloads were down 3.4% to 9.11 million carloads, while intermodal units were down 4% to 9.56 million intermodal containers and trailers. Of the commodities that have shipped more than 1 million carloads year-to-date, U.S. coal carloads were down 6.6% to 2.82 million carloads, while carloads of non-metallic minerals were down 4.7% to 1.25 million carloads. Chemical carloads were flat, falling only 0.1% to 1.16 million carloads. On a weekly basis, U.S. rail volumes were down 6.6% to 469,285 carloads and intermodal units compared with the same week in 2018. U.S. carloads fell 5.6% to 238,988 carloads, while intermodal units fell 7.5% to 230,297 intermodal containers and trailers. Source: Association of American Railroads Short-haul rail intermodal versus truck in the eastern U.S. With U.S. coal volumes facing a systemic decline, the Class I railroads have been turning to intermodal to fill in the gap. But rail intermodal, and short-haul intermodal in particular, can be vulnerable to competition from trucks. If shippers need a shipment to go about 500 miles, they might opt to use a truck instead because trucks can have a reputation of being more reliable for point-to-point deliveries. Furthermore, as almost all of the Class I railroads have adopted precision scheduled railroading, an operating strategy that seeks to streamline operations and schedules, railroads such as CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) have shed some of their intermodal lanes because those lanes didn't fit as neatly into their new operating models. The railroads also looked at what traffic levels justify the costs of maintaining these short-haul intermodal lanes, particularly in the eastern U.S. where shorter-haul lanes are more prevalent. However, removing lanes from the network can result in ripple effects across the wider rail network. Reports surfaced in late August that CSX and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) were talking with shippers and logistics providers about whether to restore intermodal service to Philadelphia, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio. UNP did not return a call seeking a request for comment. CSX said it routinely speaks with customers about growth and service opportunities. CSX CEO Jim Foote also said at a Sept. 11 investor conference that much of CSX's intermodal business is locked up in the long term with channel partners, which shields CSX from the competitive spot truck market. Whether shippers would return to the railroads should lanes reopen remains to be seen. Truck volumes and rates are weaker compared with last year and shippers view trucks as the more reliable option and so I don't see shippers running back to the railroads with open arms, said Todd Tranausky, vice president of rail and intermodal services at consulting firm FTR. Meanwhile, NSC, which had cut some shorter-haul lanes from its network as the company implemented PSR, didn't say that it wouldn't reopen lanes when it presented at an investor conference last week. As we reduce the assets…it creates a capacity dividend, and so you can look for opportunities to grow at a lower cost structure. We're looking for things that drive value to our customers and shareholders, NSC chief marketing officer Alan Shaw said at Cowen's transportation conference on Sept. 4. If CSX, NSC and UNP were to revive intermodal lanes in the eastern U.S., companies ought to consider how it manages the timing for drays, sources said. Drayage occurs when a shipment of goods reaches a warehouse or an intermodal facility and gets separated from the train it was on, and then it travels a short distance – via truck – to another facility where it is loaded onto another train bound to the shipment's destination. Intermodal, particularly domestic intermodal, has faced a number of large headwinds this year, one of which is the carrier's PSR-induced lane reductions, so time will tell what carriers think of the offering if it is indeed revived, Tranausky said. The single biggest thing carriers can do is eliminate long drays on either end and the cross-town drays at interchange. That is what I hear most about from shippers in a post-PSR intermodal world. As for restoring intermodal service to Cincinnati and Columbus, competition from the truck market might be too stiff for the railroads, a transportation consultant said. It makes sense for UNP that CSX restore service at Cincinnati and Columbus because access to those markets gives them more volume to Chicago, the consultant said. But for CSX, those markets are a short haul and some volume can be trucked from Chicago to those markets. CSX has to compete with those truck rates. Tough to make money. The two carriers might be better off doing some sort of through rates or haulage rights for UNP to those markets. Union Pacific waives accessorial fees for trucks Although UNP doesn't grapple with the same short-haul intermodal lanes as CSX and NSC do in the eastern U.S., the railroad also still faces pressure to provide reliable intermodal service. UNP said last month that it would be indefinitely suspending the implementation of accessorial charges related to its new intermodal terminal reservations (ITR) system. The new ITR system, which UNP hopes will allow for better planning of drays and ingates, replaces the Gate Reservation System at six West Coast terminals: East Coast Los Angeles, LATC, City of Industry, Lathrop, Brooklyn and TacSim. UNP has plans to roll out the technology at additional domestic terminals in the future. UNP had planned on applying accessorial fees for reservation no-shows and for reservations cancelled less than 24 hours prior to the gate cutoff, but now instead of the charges, UNP will proactively monitor and provide visibility into each customer's reservation utilization and will work with them to ensure reservations meet actual demand, UNP vice president of sales and marketing Kenny Rocker said in an Aug. 19 customer notification announcement. We will continue to monitor the need to implement an accessorial system for ITR, but we would prefer to have customers take advantage of the visibility it provides, the announcement said.

2019-09-13,"Precision Railroading Is OK So Far, But There Are Lots Of Concerns: FTR Panelists","A shipper and a consultant talking about how precision railroading's implementation has affected them both had a distinctly middle of the road–or maybe middle of the tracks–conclusion. John Schmitter, president of KEP Llc and Glenn Smith, the director of feed integrated procurement for Wayne Farms, which describes itself on its website as the sixth-largest vertically-integrated poultry producer in the U.S., both told a session of the FTR conference in Indianapolis that while precision railroading (PSR) had been much anticipated and in some cases feared, the impact on operations that they've seen has not been massive. But that doesn't mean it hasn't been significant and created worries for impacts in the future. When PSR first came in through CSX, it was the speed at which it was implemented, Smith said. That was a challenge for everybody. CSX was the first of the U.S.-based railroads to implement PSR, following its hiring of the late Hunter Harrison, who implemented it at the Canadian Class 1 railroads. Schmitter said the PSTR rollout from the Class 1 railroads has been a mixed bag for his group of clients. Once they got over some of the startup issues, it has improved reliability, he conceded. But he added–and it was a theme that Smith came back to as well–that the longer-term concern is that assets have been tightened so much by railroads implementing PSR that there isn't a lot of flexibility in the system. It has created uncertainty over whether a shipper's growth plans might be stymied by a lack of rail capacity to handle that growth. PSR practice is to squeeze the assets, Schmitter said, and bring capacity to exactly where the railroad thinks demand is going to be. The problem that both Schmitter and Smith referred to is that growth becomes difficult to plan for under PSR–will the capacity be there to handle the growth?–and the fluctuations even in the short term to medium term can be volatile. Do you know what the line is going to have if you want to ship another million tons next year? Schmitter asked. Smith, almost sounding like a union official, said of PSR: It's all about the stock price. It's not about helping the customer. However, he also noted that Wayne Farms recently opened up a new mill, and we were taken special care of. Smith acknowledged that railroads can demonstrate to its customers that they are moving more rapidly and that dwell times are down under PSR. It looks good and it sounds good, but it does not affect my business, he said. That is not better customer service for us. The railroads, of course, would argue that customer service is better if train times are accelerating (they are) and dwell time is down (it is). And the session was not just filled with negative outlooks, though inevitably when a topic is about a radical change like PSR, the changes that aren't working all that well will tend to be highlighted. Schmitter said most service is better but he also noted that PSR has the advantage in 2019 of being implemented into a market where volumes are down. That always improves fluidity and the level of service in the short term, he said. In the same vein, Schmitter had an observation about the level of customer service if you're a rail customer. Under PSR, for some clients, they have gotten better performance. But then he added: It is still at a level for which you would fire a trucking company. There was no indication from either Schmitter or Smith that visibility of assets on the rails has improved. As Smith said, Some days you have three cars at a destination and then you look up the next day and you've got 20. That creates demurrage issues, he added. Schmitter said the one metric that matters is compliance with the trip plan for a load. You say seven days, just do it, Schmitter said. And if the trip plan is followed, he added, the issue of demurrage of cars at a customer's facility should be diminished. The day-to-day operations are fine, for the most part, according to both speakers. But it's when things blow up that both Schmitter and Smith expressed concern about the reduction in all parts of the railroad's assets: locomotives, cars and crews. You don't know how far out you are from the next meltdown, Schmitter said. Smith, who operates mostly on the East Coast and has Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC) and CSX (NYSE: CSX) as its two primary railroads, talked about the prospect of an ice storm hitting his company's region. He said he is concerned about the railroads having less power, less operators and less crews to react to an event like that than in the past. I would think the reaction time would be less than you would have in the past, Smith said. The question also came up whether PSR is better for some types of rail customers than others. Smith said he did not think any one shipper has an advantage over another. But Schmitter said he thinks that manifest trains–pulling different types of cars from multiple shippers–can particularly benefit from PSR. One principal of PSR is a tighter adherence to schedules, not just for the railroad but also for the customers. The nature of a manifest train means there are more pickups, more customers and more touches. Any time you can reduce touches, it's one less thing that can go wrong, Schmitter said. Since a manifest train by definition has more touches because it has more different types of cars and more owners of those cars, it's in the best position to benefit from PSR, Schmitter said. Those trains are the ones that have had the biggest problems over the years, he added. Image Sourced from Pixabay"

2019-09-18,Shippers To Benefit From Savannah If Roads Can Keep Up,"Expansion plans at the Port of Savannah, which include opportunities for dual rail service between Savannah and Chicago, will benefit shippers so long as the transportation infrastructure leading up to the port can handle the additional potential volumes, analysts say. The challenges are going to be around the port infrastructure. Getting in and out of the port, said Jason Seidl, managing director for investment firm Cowen. The logistical challenges apply to many of the announced port expansions in recent months and not just Savannah, Seidl said. The Georgia Ports Authority announced on Sept. 12 that planned expansions will increase the Port of Savannah's annual capacity to 11 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) from its current annual capacity of 5.5 million TEUs. Expansion plans include a new container port on Hutchinson Island, located across the Savannah River channel, which will have an annual capacity of 2.5 million TEUs. The ports authority also plans to expand rail infrastructure to attract new business and handle container trade crossing the Garden City Terminal. A $220 million expansion of on-terminal rail infrastructure is currently underway at the Mason Mega Rail Terminal at the Port of Savannah. Phase I one of the project will be complete in the spring of 2020, while the second phase will open later that year. The project is anticipated to double the Port of Savannah's annual rail lift capacity to 1 million containers. Georgia Ports Authority Executive Director Griffith Lynch said that the port will be supporting dual rail service via CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) from the Port of Savannah to Chicago, with cargo reaching Chicago in less than three days. NS currently offers rail service between Savannah and Chicago seven days a week. CSX recently added direct service. We're now moving containers from ship to departing rail in only 24 hours – two and a half times faster than our previous schedule – which makes Savannah competitive on time, and lower on cost, compared to traditional cargo routings, Lynch said in the annual State-of-the-Port address. A SONAR chart shows the changes in monthly volumes of non-refrigerated, loaded containers heading to Chicago from Savannah. The blue line represents 40-foot containers and the green line represents 20-foot containers. Source: SONAR Shippers will have two competitive Class I's to choose from as well as a truck alternative depending on the ultimate destination of the cargo, said Todd Tranausky, vice president of rail and intermodal at FTR Transportation Intelligence. It really keeps Savannah on the cutting edge of being able to provide capacity on the east coast and be a location of choice for shippers to use. The expansion plans at Savannah are also an attempt to entice more business to come to the U.S. East Coast instead of going to the bustling West Coast ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. It's all with the same goal in mind: to steal business from the West Coast, Seidl said, referring to the port expansions not just in Savannah, but elsewhere in the U.S. and Canada. FreightWaves reported in June that the Port of Savannah was seeking to boost its market share of freight moving to the Midwest, including the St. Louis area, as a way of driving business away from the West Coast ports. Administrators will need to ensure the infrastructure supporting the port can handle the extra volumes anticipated from the landside expansion and dredging to accommodate larger ships, according to experts. A lot of these planned expansions don't take into account traffic patterns and dray operations, Seidl said. The roads to and from the ports rarely change, he said. Image Sourced from Pixabay"

2019-09-23,August Employment Level Reaches New Low At US Railroads,"The total number of employees working for the U.S. operations of Class I railroads in August sank to its lowest level in years, according to an analysis of data from the Surface Transportation Board. The number of employees working in August totaled 139,284 workers, which is not only the lowest total for 2019, but also the lowest total for all the monthly data since January 2012, the earliest date that FreightWaves has monthly data available. August's total is 1% lower than July and 6% lower than August 2018. Meanwhile, the number of train and engine employees, which is a category that is more sensitive to changes in rail volumes, also slumped to its lowest level for 2019. The headcount for train and engine employees in August totaled 58,491, which is a 1.3% drop from July and a 6.3% decline from August 2018. The sizeable declines between August 2018 and August 2019 are largely attributable to the adoption of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operating model that seeks to streamline operations through shedding assets and optimizing schedules. All of the Class I railroads except BNSF (NYSE: BRK) deploy PSR, with Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) being the latest to deploy the operating model in some iteration. One of the effects of PSR is to trim employee levels because of changes in how the railroads manage their networks. Earlier in September, NSC reportedly furloughed nearly 300 employees in Virginia and Pennsylvania. UNP also laid off employees at facilities in the Pacific Northwest earlier this year as it began to implement its version of PSR. NSC has not responded to a FreightWaves request for comment on the reported layoffs as of publication time. Reducing headcount levels has also been a strategy that the railroads have used to respond to persistently lower rail volumes or downturns in rail demand. As we move closer to 3Q19 earnings season, we will continue to monitor sequentialheadcount trends as a read through for incremental margins and cost controls as the Big 4 U.S. rails look to combat weaker than anticipated volumes with operational efficiencies, led by headcount reductions, said transportation analyst Bascome Majors with investment firm Susquehanna Financial Group in a Sept. 18 research note. In spite of volume-related headcount reductions, some executives have said that such a strategy might not benefit companies long term because the railroads invest significant hours in training employees, only to lose them if they don't return after being furloughed. The place we have to be careful [in rightsizing] is for crews because it can be hard to hire workers in some locations, Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) chief financial officer Ghislain Houle said at an investor conference recently. But CNI can be more aggressive in cutting costs through using fewer railcars, he said. We can cut costs, but we have to be careful and mindful that cycles come and go, Houle said.

2019-09-24,Norfolk Southern might owe millions for alleged contract breach,"Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) could be forced to pay millions of dollars for breaching a contract to ship coal to coal-fired power plants, a jury determined last week. A jury found on Sept. 17 that NSC didn't deliver coal supplied by Alabama-based Drummond Coal from the Shipyard Terminal in Charleston, South Carolina, to 23 destinations in the eastern U.S. The case was heard in the U.S. District Court in Roanoke, Virginia. NSC declined to comment on the proceeding since it's part of ongoing litigation. An initial contract, entered in January 2006, called for NSC to deliver coal that Drummond imported from Colombia to power plants in the southeastern U.S., according to a court filing that Drummond submitted. Drummond and NSC amended that contract in January 2010, and the contract was to last through December 31, 2019. But during that timeframe, coal consumption among U.S. power plants declined. Regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency called for utilities to adopt emissions controls that discouraged utilities from consuming coal. Low natural gas prices in this same time period also encouraged utilities to switch to using more natural gas instead of coal to generate electricity. As a result of these factors, utilities shut down their coal-fired units. Drummond said in court filings that more than half of the 23 destinations that were to receive Drummond's coal had closed or no longer burned coal. Drummond stipulates that the contract requires NSC to work with Drummond to ship a guaranteed volume for each year of the contract. But Drummond said NSC didn't provide any alternatives, and instead sent shortfall invoices for not meeting guaranteed volumes for each year from 2011 to 2015. Drummond paid about $35 million in shortfall fees. But NSC argued that Drummond elected not to ship any coal from the Shipyard River Terminal in 2011 and in subsequent years. NSC said the guaranteed volume was 1.29 million short tons annually. Drummond also said that NSC has contracts with utilities to ship minimal amounts of coal, and instead of shipping Drummond's coal, NSC shipped coal that came from Drummond's competitors, which enabled NSC to receive a double benefit because it was collecting fees from Drummond. NSC said it merely transports the coal tendered to it for shipment, and Drummond didn't tender any coal for shipment between 2011 and 2015. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-09-24,Norfolk Southern Taps Mongeau For Board Seat,"Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) announced that Claude Mongeau has been elected as a director, effective Sept. 23. Mongeau is the former president and chief executive officer of Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI). He will serve on the board's compensation and finance and risk management committees as an independent director. We are excited and pleased to welcome Claude to the Norfolk Southern board. Claude's deep knowledge and understanding of precision scheduled railroading will be invaluable as we continue to implement our PSR-based strategic plan to drive efficiencies, service, growth, and shareholder value. Claude brings hands-on experience in aligning PSR with a customer focus that promotes end-to-end supply chain performance and growth, said chairman, president and CEO James A. Squires. Mongeau is credited with implementing a customer-centric version of precision scheduled railroading (PSR) that resulted in rail service improvements while the head of Canadian National. In addition to leading Canadian National from 2010 to 2016, Mongeau held various roles in his 22-year career with the railroad including chief financial officer, vice president of strategic and financial planning, and assistant vice president corporate development. He also serves as a director on the boards of Calgary-based oil and natural gas company, Cenovus Energy (NYSE:CVE), and Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD). Some may view Mongeau's addition to the Norfolk Southern board as an effort to meaningfully improve its PSR initiatives or to explore potential opportunities to partner with other Class I railroads as Canadian National has done recently. Canadian National and CSX (NYSE:CSX) recently collaborated to offer a new intermodal service providing each with access to the others traditional ports of service. Additionally, Canadian National purchased a stretch of CSX's non-core northeast rail line at the end of August. NSC Stock Chart – SONAR: (STOCK.NSC) Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-10-01,Commentary: What's The 2020 Outlook For Railroad Capital Expenditures?,"As you read this market view, the planning for year 2020 railroad capital work is well underway. It is that time of the year when staff members in different major departments within each Class 1 railroad company lay out their expectations for next year's budgets. The strategic question might be, What's the outlook in a period of traffic uncertainty? My hypothesis suggests lower capital expenditures (cap ex) for 2020 than in 2019. Unlike truckers, railroad managers face multi-faceted budget hurdles. Rail executives have a complex infrastructure to both maintain as well as improve. As previously discussed, railways are vast real estate organizations. They don't pay into a trust fund to keep their ways in shape as with highways. Regional engineers have calculated their wish list of projects based upon this year's out-in-the-field operating experience. Those localized track, structure, signals and bridge needs estimates will then be sorted at headquarters against other system-wide data. The data sets include evaluations of ultrasonic inspection tapes of steel rails as well as assessments of geometry and surface defects that at some point require engineered correction. All these hard data engineering assessments must be prioritized against the other overall business needs that marketing staff as well as locomotive and freight car mechanical departments are compiling. Into October and November there will be a vetting of these competing cap ex needs lists. Not every project is going to be funded. Most capital projects require a calculated cost/benefit calculation that allows these senior officers to rank projects by expected rate of return. Those return on investment estimates are reviewed by the finance department according to approved templates. Three right-of-way sectors require constant maintenance – plus periodic heavy-duty maintenance. They are: Track structure Bridges, culverts and tunnels Signal and communications systems Beyond that are movable assets like locomotives and freight cars. And there are general and administrative capital assets such as computers. When most people think about the railroad track structure, they probably think first of the railroad tracks. In doing so, they might overlook the actual physical design of the railway routes that dissipates vertical forces from train passages down through the different layers of the structure. That vertical track structure is illustrated in the following graphic. Layers of the railroad track structure as a graphic showing the always visible steel rails and ties (sleepers in other parts of the world) down through the ballast and into the sub-grade. This route structure part of the railroad capital assets (along with tunnels) has the longest economic life measured often in 50- to 100-plus years. But this structure also requires a good deal of steady state maintenance to do such things as keep ballast clean and the geometry level. That kind of continuing maintenance consumes most of a railroad company's capital dollars each year. Table 1 identifies the broad categories over which capital dollars are spent each year on a major Class 1 railroad that likely spends between $3 and $4 billion as its announced capital budget. A review of multiple railroads' investor reports and SEC filings shows that the typical allocation of capital expenditure program by type of project includes: Track/roadbed – 48% Locomotives – 22% Capacity added – 6% Signals/communications – 6% Freight cars – 4% Safety – 2% Remember that these percentages represent long-term patterns. In any given year or series of years, a category can have a significantly higher or lower percentage share of the budget. Track and roadbed share might drop to 38 percent or lower in some years. Capital investment in Positive Train Control (PTC), for example, has been taking a rather large share of all major railroad capital dollars over the past half-decade or more. During the early phases of a railroad adopting so-called Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) as a business model, some of these categories will see both a lower annual dollar allocation as well as a percentage of the cap ex annual budget pie. As one possible example, the financial targets under the roll-out of PSR heavily emphasize a reduction in locomotives and excess freight cars. That is the pattern revealed when we examine the changing railroad investment presentation slides. In previous decades, when a railroad's returns on capital assets was often in the 4 to 7 % range, many railroads tried to limit their annual capital expenditure to a target maximum. One target range would be that capital expenditures would not exceed 75% to 80% of operating income. During the high annual traffic growth years between 2002 and 2006, and again in 2010 to 2013 – the cap ex of most of the Class 1 railroads like BNSF and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) often was elevated and could represent about 20% to 25% of freight revenues. However, many of the railroad companies will see their total capital expenditures budget drop to a 14% to 18% share of freight revenues. One notable exception is at Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI), where exceptionally high traffic growth across the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia has resulted in CN having to invest significant capital to add trains per day and track capacity. That's regarded as a positive investment shift. That change results in the 2018-19 capital expenditure budget at Canadian National increasing up to the higher 20%-plus share of freight revenues. That's the background. After prioritization, the capital budget moves to the Board of Directors for discussion and a final decision. This typically occurs during late November or early December. Board approval then starts the process of bids and procurement. That allows materials to be ordered, then received. All of this takes time. Railroads' cap ex projects are normally released to the industry press in January. Figure 2 illustrates the recent pattern of U.S. railroad capital spending. Expenditure on U.S. freight railroad's infrastructure and rail equipment between 2006 and 2018 ($ Billions) Source: A blend of AAR data and a Statista 2019 report What is the outlook for 2020? That's tricky to estimate given uncertainty of the U.S. economy and trade headwinds. Here is my estimated outlook based upon the current market view. The capital expenditures for PTC projects over the past decade was estimated by various industry sources at a $12 billion initial design and install expense. Most of the ongoing component system is now in place. Therefore, incremental dispatching and communications PTC expenses are likely to fall during 2020. Exceptions might occur if certain PTC parts fail to perform as expected. There is very little all new railroad freight line construction underway in the U.S. There are no large carload railroad yard projects being built, for Union Pacific Corporation's (NYSE:UNP) delayed Brazos classification yard in Texas. A logical outlook into year 2020 suggests that fewer than 500 locomotives will be ordered. In contrast, in a good year about 900 new locomotives would be ordered. New railroad freight car orders will drop to around 40,000 – which is about a calculated steady state fleet size replacement rate. In contrast, a good year might see 60,000 to 70,000 units ordered. A year ago, the railroad boards of directors collectively approved healthy 2019 capital expenditures' budgets. At the time, that expressed optimism about the year 2019 business volume for non-coal carload traffic and both domestic intermodal and international intermodal traffic growth. That business unit volume growth hasn't occurred. The signals are that the 2019 traffic volumes have turned out as much as 6% to near 10% lower than expected for the year. Railroad board members often tend to be conservative, especially as they consider the flawed traffic volume outlook for 2019 that is still fresh in their minds. The result? It is possible that the U.S. railways' may lower their 2020 capital budgets by as much as 4 to 6% below the amount authorized for 2019. What is your outlook? Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-10-02,Surface Transportation Board Issues Two Proposed Rule-makings,"The Surface Transportation Board (STB) has been busy lately. The Board issued two proposed rulemakings on September 30, while an August decision regarding fuel surcharges has led a coalition of shippers' interests to ask the Board to reconsider its decision. Railroads' Cost of Capital On September 30, the STB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking addressing how it determines the railroad industry's cost of capital. It is proposing an additional model, called Step MSDCF into its methodology for calculating the cost of capital. The Board explained that it determines the railroad industry's cost of capital each year and it uses that figure in a variety of regulatory proceedings. The cost of capital consists of the weighted average of the cost of debt and the cost of equity. There are two models that the STB uses, and the Board is proposing to add Step MSDCF as a third model. When used with the two existing models, [Step MSDCF] would enhance the robustness of resulting cost-of-equity estimate during times when railroads undertake significant operational changes, STB said. Comments on this notice are due by November 5 and replies are due by December 4. More information is available here. STB seeks to amend rail performance data reporting rules governing chemicals and plastics shipments The Board issued a second notice of proposed rulemaking on September 30 to amend the rules governing railroad performance data reporting for chemicals and plastics traffic. The Board is seeking to have chemicals and plastics traffic become a distinct reporting category in the Class I railroads' weekly reporting of the cars-held metric. The metric tracks the average number of loaded and empty railcars that have not moved for 48 hours or longer, the STB said. The change would help the Board track service conditions. The Board's proposed rulemaking is due in part to a petition filed by the American Chemistry Council. The Board believes that reporting of this data for chemical and plastics traffic would give the agency and stakeholders better visibility into the fluidity of this traffic segment. With this data, both the Board and its stakeholders would be better positioned to detect and mitigate emerging service issues affecting chemicals and plastics shipments, STB said. Comments are due by December 6 and replies are due by January 6, 2020. More information can be found here. STB should revisit fuel surcharge issue: shippers On August 29, the Board opted to discontinue a proceeding on fuel surcharges, Ex Parte 661, because it could not reach a consensus on how to address the issue of fuel surcharges. The proceeding was on whether the STB should remove a safe harbor provision under current fuel surcharge rules. The safe harbor provision enabled rail carriers to measure changes in fuel costs, and the safe harbor index couldn't be challenged for its reasonableness because it had undergone the public comment process. But shippers have contended that the railroads took advantage of the program and profited greatly from it. The Western Coal Traffic League, the American Public Power Association, the Edison Electric Institute, the Freight Rail Customer Alliance and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association asked the Board to reconsider its decision and even consider a notice of proposed rulemaking to address the issue. The Board's statutory responsibility is to regulate and eliminate unreasonable carrier practices, not to arbitrarily brush them aside. On reconsideration, the Board should vacate its Decision and publish a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing remedial rules to stop (or reduce) carriers' ongoing fuel surcharge profiteering, the groups said in a September 18 filing. The issue of fuel surcharges was also in the courts this week. In a related but non-Board action, as many as 30 companies have filed lawsuits against BNSF (NYSE:BRK), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) on claims that the railroads profited from excessive fuel surcharges that were administered between 2003 and 2008.

2019-10-03,Shippers Hammer Railroads With Lawsuits Over Fuel Surcharges,"U.S. Class I railroads BNSF (NYSE:BRK), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) got slammed with lawsuits this week from shippers of various industries. The lawsuits allege that between 2003 and 2008, the railroads engaged in price fixing by assessing fuel surcharges and saying they were part of a fuel cost recovery program, thus violating the Sherman Act. More than two dozen lawsuits may have been filed this week on the issue, according to research conducted via PACER, an online database of court filings. Plaintiffs range from power companies such as Ameren Missouri, Duke Energy Carolinas and Dominion Energy, to chemicals and energy suppliers such as Eastman Chemical and Phillips 66, to automakers such as KIA and Hyundai. The multiple filings could be related to a federal appeals court ruling on August 16, in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld a previous decision that prevented rail shippers from being able to form a class action lawsuit to argue against alleged fuel surcharge price fixing. As a result of the D.C. Appeals Court decision, rail shippers would have to file lawsuits individually and within a certain timeframe if they still wanted to pursue the issue. In 2003, the four largest United States-based Class I railroads engaged in an extraordinary series of meetings, phone calls and email communications through which they embarked on a conspiracy – under the guise of a fuel cost recovery program – to apply and enforce rail fuel surcharges across their customers in order to generate profits, read several court filings, including those from Dominion, chemicals supplier Old World Industries, Kia and chemicals shipper PCS Sales. The filing continued, Defendants used ‘rate-based' fuel surcharges – i.e., surcharges that use a percentage applied to the base rate for a shipment – as a means to impose across-the-board rate increases on rail freight shipments, a result that would have been prohibitively difficult to achieve on a contract-by-contract basis. Throughout the conspiracy and despite customer pushback against Defendants' fuel surcharges, Defendants set aside their individual, economic self-interest to undercut one another and instead staunchly maintained their fuel surcharge program, pocketing billions of dollars in profits as a result. CSX and NSC said they would not comment on pending litigation, while BNSF said it is reviewing the filings. Attorneys for several of the plaintiffs also didn't return a request for comment. These allegations are not new and we have strongly denied these accusations for well over a decade, BNSF said. We believe the claims are meritless and we plan to vigorously defend ourselves in court, UNP said. As the courts potentially grapple with the fuel surcharge issue, so too could the Surface Transportation Board (STB). In an unrelated action, the STB opted to discontinue a proceeding on fuel surcharges on August 29 because it could not reach a consensus on how to address the issue. But a coalition of shippers' groups asked STB to reconsider its decision and even consider a rulemaking. They contended the railroads took advantage of the program and profited greatly from it, according to a September 18 filing by the Western Coal Traffic League, the American Public Power Association, the Edison Electric Institute, the Freight Rail Customer Alliance and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association.

2019-10-03,Norfolk Southern Rail Bridge Collapses In Missouri Flooding,"A railroad bridge used by Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) has collapsed into the Grand River in Missouri. Unbelievable. pic.twitter.com/2kPJqTtR5D — Jeff Nail (@jeffnail2) October 2, 2019 According to the Railway Track and Structures (RT&S) website, Norfolk Southern has suspended service in Missouri between Moberly and Kansas City. The bridge and track weight capacity on this stretch is 286,000 pounds. The Class 1 railroad issued a service alert saying that it is working with our interline partners to detour freight traffic over alternative gateways. Customers with traffic operating to and from the Kansas City area should expect a 48- to 72-hour delay. Debris and high flood waters have been issues for the past several days near the Grand River Bridge in Brunswick, Missouri. National Weather Service (NWS) Flood Warnings, housed inside the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events platform, remain posted along the Missouri River. A Twitter video shows the bridge dropping into the river on the evening of October 2. The NWS Missouri Basin River forecast center tweeted earlier today, October 3, that backwater from debris caused the Brunswick gauge to rise. Just before dark, the railroad bridge west of Brunswick, the Norfolk Southern rail line, their main line, the bridge has washed out, Brunswick emergency management director Brent Dickerson told KWIX radio. SONAR Critical Events: Flood Warnings continue on the Missouri River where the Norfolk Southern rail bridge collapse occurred on October 2, 2019. Due to a logjam underneath the bridge, Norfolk Southern decided to cut the rails on the span so it could control the collapse. Earlier reports cited a barge striking the bridge, which turned out to be false. Flooding in the area is making it difficult for crews to repair the damage. The flood stage at Brunswick is 19.0 feet, and on October 1 the Grand River had risen to 25.35 feet. The NWS considered that minor flood level, but it was less than two feet from reaching moderate flood stage. The river has dropped over the last 24 hours, but may rise again by this weekend. Grand River stage at Brunswick, Missouri. (Source: NWS) While nobody has reported injuries, Brunswick marine access has been closed for safety reasons. Norfolk Southern crews are working with Chariton County officials to to keep boaters away. Dickerson said barricades have been set up to protect people. So let the railroad have their barrier to work with whatever they need to do, stated Dickerson. And for safety reasons is the main thing, because we don't know where the bridge went. We do know it went down, most of the middle sections did go down to the south. We don't know if it's there sticking up or whatever. Norfolk Southern officials don't know when the bridge will be back in service. This could affect farmers in the region during harvest time because the railroad carries grain out of Chariton County. According to the company's website, Norfolk Southern is a major transporter of industrial products including chemicals, agriculture, and metals and construction materials. It operates approximately 19,500 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia, serving every major container port in the eastern United States. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-10-04,"Snow, Slush, Slow Downs In Northern Rockies","Northern Rockies nuisance Periods of snow and rain will slow down drivers in the northern Rockies today, October 4, and tonight. Most of the snowfall will impact travel in high elevations of central and eastern Idaho, as well as southwestern Montana and western Wyoming. Although the National Weather Service (NWS) hasn't issued any winter weather alerts, and this storm won't likely have major impacts, it may cause minor delays for some shippers. SONAR Critical Events: Friday, October 4, 10:00 a.m. EDT Look for total snow accumulations of up to six inches at pass level around Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and the Big Horn Mountains in Wyoming; Borah Peak, Stanley, Ketchum, Sun Valley and Galena in Idaho; and up to 10 inches in the Crazy, Beartooth and Absaroka mountains in Montana. Watch out for snowy/slushy conditions on I-90 over Bozeman Pass and on US-212 near Red Lodge, Montana, as well as on I-15 in Idaho from Monida to Dubois. Strong crosswinds in Idaho, gusting as high as 50 mph, will reduce visibility at times due to blowing snow and could make deadheading risky on I-15, US-93 and SR-39. Other notable U.S. weather Rain showers and thunderstorms will be scattered today from the Desert Southwest to the Great Plains and Midwest. Areas of localized flash flooding are possible across New Mexico, possibly affecting travel on portions of I-25 and I-40. A few spots of large hail and severe winds could pop up from northern Nebraska into South Dakota, between I-80 and I-90. SONAR Critical Events: Friday, October 4, 10:00 a.m. EDT Drivers who plan to park overnight in the Northeast and in northern lower Michigan may want to pour winter additive in their diesel. Low temperatures will drop into the 20s across upstate New York and much of interior New England where the NWS has posted Freeze Warnings. The Freeze Warnings – housed inside the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events platform, along with all other NWS alerts – are the areas shaded in blue-green in the SONAR chart directly above. Additional notes A section of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) rail is out of service in Missouri between Moberly and Kansas City because of a debris strike to the Grand River bridge in Brunswick, Missouri. Due to a logjam underneath the bridge, Norfolk Southern decided to cut the rails on the span so it could control the collapse.

2019-10-07,"Snowstorm Returning Soon To Northern Rockies, Plains","Wet start to the week Look for a few thunderstorms and rainy weather at times today, Oct. 7, from the Tennessee Valley all the way to New England. This is due to a cold front moving through the eastern United States. The rain will slow down drivers a bit, but there is good news – the chance of running into large hail, severe winds or flash flooding is low. As the front exits the East Coast tonight, the tail end of it may get stuck over southern Florida, producing periods of heavy rain and flash flooding tomorrow and Wednesday. Winter-like woes returning to northern tier states Planning ahead, another potent early season snowstorm may close roads and knock out power in portions of the northern Rockies and the northern Great Plains from Tuesday, Oct. 8 through Friday, Oct. 11. SONAR Critical Events: Monday, October 7, 10:00 a.m. EDT Tonight, an upper level trough of low pressure will drop into the Pacific Northwest, bringing abundant moisture to the mountains of Glacier National Park. This will produce widespread rainfall and high elevation snowfall. Early tomorrow morning, Oct. 8, a strong Canadian surface cold front will push south of the border. Behind the front, temperatures will drop below freezing, causing wet roads to ice over and changing areas of rain to snow. The rapid change to freezing temperatures and widespread snowfall will make driving very difficult to downright dangerous on parts of I-15, I-90 and I-94, as well as many secondary routes across the region. So the National Weather Service (NWS) has changed some areas previously under a winter storm watch to the more serious winter storm warning. Many areas remain under the winter storm watch, and all alerts cover portions of western, central and south-central Montana, as well as northern Wyoming. As of this morning, the NWS expects the highest snowfall totals to occur around Great Falls, Helena, MacDonald Pass, Rogers Pass, Raynesford, Lewistown, Montana City, Elk Park Pass, Homestake Pass, Townsend and White Sulphur Springs. These areas could see up to 18 inches in the high elevations with 4 to 12 inches in the lower slopes. Other areas like Beaverhead, Bozeman, West Yellowstone and Targhee Pass could get socked in with 12 to 16 inches of fresh mountain snow, 4 to 10 inches in the lower elevations. Places such as Butte and Cut Bank, as well as Logan and Marias passes could get hit with up to 12 inches in the mountains and 2 to 6 inches down below. Strong wind gusts will reduce visibility at times due to blowing and drifting snow, and the winds will also make it risky to deadhead through the region. Trees and power lines could get blown down and block roads. The storm could also delay operations at a number of international airports and oil facilities in the region, as indicated by the red and orange dots and doughnuts on the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events map above. The storm should fade across the northern Rockies late Wednesday night into early Thursday morning, Oct. 10, as it moves into the Dakotas. It's still a bit too early to determine the full impact the storm will have in the Dakotas. However, wind and accumulating snow wind could linger there through Friday, Oct. 11. Additional notes A section of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) rail is out of service in Missouri between Moberly and Kansas City because of logjams and debris strikes to the Grand River bridge in Brunswick, Missouri. Shippers operating through this area should expect delays of at least 48 to 72 hours. Interstate 29 in Iowa remains closed due to flooding, from just north of Council Bluffs to Loveland.

2019-10-07,"Intermodal Freight Continues Shift To East Coast, Benefiting Trucking","Container volume growth on the East Coast of North America continues to outpace growth on the West Coast, despite longer ocean transit times and higher prices from Asia. But the eastern railroads are not necessarily the beneficiaries here. CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) has cut many intermodal lanes, reducing intermodal volumes by 8% year-to-date, which followed a similar drop the prior year – the largest drop of any Class 1 railroad. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), on the other hand, moves the most intermodal freight as a percentage of total carloadings (55%), but has struggled to deliver operating ratio improvements as average intermodal rates fell from $1.78/mile to $1.47/mile this year (INTRM.USA). First, price action in the spot markets for 40-foot containers from Asia to North America has responded to volume growth on the East Coast. Over the course of September, rates to West Coast ports (FBXD.CNAW) fell while they were flat or up to the East Coast ports (FBXD.CNAE), widening the ‘Panama spread' (FBXD.PANA), or the difference between the rates. (Chart: FreightWaves SONAR) A widening Panama spread has the effect of making West Coast ports relatively more attractive. U.S. Customs imported shipments to Savannah (CSTM.SAV) are at one of the highest levels they've been at in two years, while the same data for Los Angeles (CSTM.LAX) was higher for most of that period than it is today. (Chart: FreightWaves SONAR) But the railroads that have pursued intermodal the most aggressively have underperformed against their main competitors, especially in the case of the eastern rails, CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern. After CSX chief executive officer Hunter Harrison's death in December 2017, Jim Foote took over, and described in earnings calls how the railroad's intermodal network was almost a separate franchise that had been left nearly untouched by Harrison's reorganization of the rest of CSX's operations. Foote removed about 7% of CSX's intermodal volumes as he ‘rationalized' the network to focus on high-density lanes where he saw an opportunity to improve service and yield by reducing the number of touches involved in CSX's handling of the freight. The railroad was able to gets its operating ratio (OR), or the percentage of revenue consumed by operating expenses, down to 57.4% in the second quarter of 2019. Norfolk Southern, on the other hand, is more committed to its intermodal business. NSC's intermodal volumes are down only 2.4% year-to-date, compared to CSX's 8%, the smallest drop of any U.S. railroad. But weak trucking spot prices (DATVF.VNU), down 16.4% year-to-date, have pulled intermodal rates down with them. Norfolk Southern was one of the last railroads to embrace the cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), but so far has not seen the dramatic early-stage benefits that typically come with it. While the recent network changeover occurred without major incident, we are nonetheless puzzled by the seeming divergence in how the margin improvement story is unfolding at NSC versus prior PSR iterations (including what we have seen so far from UNP), wrote Credit Suisse equities analyst Allison Landry in a July note on Norfolk Southern. Typically, the step-function change in the OR occurs swiftly and in the magnitude of several hundred basis points of improvement within the first 12-18 months of implementation. Norfolk Southern's large intermodal business, generally understood to be lower-margin than other commodity types, may be part of the problem. The other issue is that many railroad analysts think that intermodal is less competitive on the East Coast, that it doesn't make as much economic sense to shippers, because average lengths of haul are shorter. If a shipper is moving freight from Los Angeles to Chicago, a distance of 2,000 miles, the shipper can save far more money by using intermodal instead of truck that it can on a lane like Savannah to Chicago, which is only about 970 miles. Shippers who choose intermodal over truck are normally trading service for price, but for some customers, the trade-off is only worth it on long-haul lanes that produce bigger cost savings. The chart below shows relative year-to-date growth in long-haul trucking tender volumes for Savannah, Los Angeles, Elizabeth, New Jersey, and Houston. (Chart: FreightWaves SONAR) Savannah's long-haul trucking volumes have grown the fastest by far, nearly twice as fast as those of Los Angeles. Part of the railroads' struggle with intermodal this year – across the Class 1s, intermodal volumes are down 4.1% year-to-date – is caused by relatively soft freight demand and relatively loose trucking capacity. The rails have taken advantage of thinner volumes to reduce dwell times and run their trains faster, but those service metrics could deteriorate if volumes came back in a big way, for example if a resolution to trade disputes came earlier than expected, and re-accelerating economic growth sparked a surge in consumption. In that scenario, railroad terminals could become snarled, trains might be delayed, and healthy margins might prove to be elusive as time-sensitive shippers prefer to pay premium prices to trucking carriers instead of the rails. Rails remain hotly debated, observed Deutsche Bank equities analyst Amit Mehrotra in an October 3 investor note. Investor bias is positive, but the magnitude of the volume decline is concerning, and as a result, third quarter results will be critical to the near/midterm outlook for Rail shares. In this sense, near-term conviction is significantly shaken, but long-term thesis still holds. Efficiency differences between port operators, the environmental regulation of drayage providers in Southern California, persistent labor disputes, and competitive container rates are all driving intermodal volumes to the East Coast. At present, it appears that CSX is largely uninterested in capturing that freight, Norfolk Southern may have more of it than it actually wants – NSC guided for flat intermodal volume growth for the full year – and that trucking carriers could stand to benefit the most.

2019-10-08,US Freight Railroads File Lawsuit Against Rail Workers' Union Over Train Crew Size,"Eight U.S. freight railroads have filed a lawsuit against a railroad union, saying the union is refusing to come to the bargaining table to hash out issues involving train crew size. The railroads say the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers – Transportation Division (SMART-TD) is refusing to engage on the issue of train crew size as both sides prepare for an upcoming round of collective bargaining that is slated to start after November 1. SMART-TD has consistently refused to bargain over crew consist [the complement of a train crew], asserting, among other things, that any proposals on this subject are barred by ‘moratorium' provisions in existing agreements. The railroads disagree with that interpretation, and maintain that any disagreement over the meaning of the moratoriums is a ‘minor dispute' subject to binding arbitration, the railroads said in their October 3 court filing to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas in Fort Worth. The lawsuit defines the moratorium provisions as protections offered to employees in exchange for reductions in crew consist. The railroads say these moratoriums don't prohibit the railroads from making new proposals on other subjects, including the number, function or assignment of ground service personnel on trains. The railroads also say SMART-TD is obliged to participate in collective bargaining over train crew size per the Railway Labor Act. Their potential discussions would affect labor arrangements system-wide. The railroads involved in the lawsuit include BNSF (NYSE:BRK), CSX (NYSE:CSX), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), the Belt Railway Company of Chicago, and two Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) subsidiaries, the Grand Trunk Western Railroad, which operates in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio and the Illinois Central Railroad, which operates in Illinois and Iowa, with routes connecting to Mobile, Alabama and New Orleans, Louisiana. The issue of train crew size has come increasingly under debate after the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) said in a May determination that it was no longer pursuing a proposed rule on whether it should require train crew sizes of at least two crew members. The rail industry has said that establishing the size of a train crew is a discussion more appropriate for the bargaining table and that technologies such as positive train control will enable rail operations to be even safer. Meanwhile, union leaders have said that a minimal train crew size of at least two people enables safer operations, especially as trains become longer. Although FRA's May determination says that state laws requiring minimum train crew sizes were voided as a result, state legislative activity mandating a minimum train crew size has continued, while some members of Congress have introduced bills addressing the issue. The train crew size issue is also being debated in the courts. SMART-TD said the lawsuit is an attempt to undermine our collective bargaining agreements and the bargaining process. This is not the first time that the rail carriers have attempted an attack on crew consist. SMART Transportation Division President Jeremy Ferguson, noting the carriers' history of unsuccessful attacks on crew consist, stated, ‘this latest attempt is nothing new, and it will once again be met with a vigorous defense.'

2019-10-08,Major Snowstorm Still On Track To Slam Northern Plains,"A significant early season snowstorm will intensify later today, October 8, in the northern Rockies, lasting through tomorrow night/early Thursday, October 10. FreightWaves first reported on this potential storm on October 7. Delays are inevitable, and drivers should avoid the region if possible. The set-up A strong cold front has been moving across the western Hi-Line area of Montana this morning. This is the area along US-2 in northern Montana, just south of the Canadian border. Meteorologists at the National Weather Service said the forecast remains on track for this front to continue dropping southward, reaching the Helena, Montana area around by noon MDT, and into the Bozeman area by late afternoon. SONAR Critical Events: Tuesday, October 8, 10:00 a.m. EDT Winds will be from the north by that time and quite gusty, producing a quick drop in temperatures once the front moves through these areas into Wyoming. Most spots across the northern and central parts of Big Sky country will observe their high temperatures in the morning, with some near-normal daytime highs in the southwestern section of the state. Widespread precipitation may lag the front by a couple of hours for some areas. Also, the precipitation may begin as rain before changing to snow. Snowfall will become widespread tonight through Wednesday. The best chances for snow will come along the Rocky Mountain Front, and then from Great Falls to Lewistown and southward. North of this line may only see a brief period of snow and little accumulation. The remainder of the region will see periods of moderate to heavy snow, as well as gusty winds and blowing snow. Snow should diminish later Wednesday afternoon into the evening. Here is the forecast snowfall from early this morning to Wednesday night. Get more info at https://t.co/5kv9gqw8qu. #mtwx pic.twitter.com/45yFVo36By — NWS Great Falls (@NWSGreatFalls) October 8, 2019 Snowfall amounts Forecast snowfall amounts have come down a bit overall from previous forecasts, but the Rocky Mountain Front – the transition zone between the Rockies and the grassy Plains – along with the central and southwestern mountains of Montana will be hit with at least 12 inches of total snowfall. Some spots like Rogers, Bozeman and Targhe passes, in addition to Red Lodge, Nye and the Beartooth Mountains, could get socked with 15 to 18 inches. Look for six inches or more across lower peaks in the southwestern and central areas, including Billings, Great Falls, Helena, Bozeman and West Yellowstone. Several inches to a foot of snow could pile up across the northern half of Wyoming, including Casper, Riverton, Sheridan and surrounding areas. Various winter weather alerts remain posted across the region. Don't let today's warm temperatures fool you! A #winterstorm is on the horizon and is set to move into our area late this evening. Time to bring out the shovel and your snow brush! #mtwx #wywx pic.twitter.com/xlrlWKNCvX — NWS Billings (@NWSBillings) October 8, 2019 Winds will be strong enough to cause occasional white-out conditions due to blowing snow on the I-15, I-90 and I-94 corridors. Besides very hazardous driving conditions, downed trees and power lines will lead to loss of electricity and potential roadblocks that may last up to 24 hours. Operations will also be disrupted at several international airports and oil facilities. These are indicated by the red and orange dots and doughnuts on the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events map above, where red represents a forecast of a High risk of disruption and orange represents a Medium risk. Additional notes A section of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) rail is out of service in Missouri between Moberly and Kansas City because of logjams and debris strikes to the Grand River bridge in Brunswick, Missouri. Shippers operating through this area should expect delays of at least 48 to 72 hours. According to the Iowa Department of Transportation, the section of I-29 that has been closed for weeks due to flooding – from just north of Council Bluffs to Loveland – has been opened. Finally, some lanes and ramps of the I-10 bridge over the San Jacinto River are still closed. This is just east of Houston and is due to damage during last month's flooding from Tropical Storm Imelda. According to the Texas Department of Transportation, repairs may not be finished until early 2020. Tropical update Super Typhoon Hagibis is still spinning over the western Pacific Ocean, producing sustained winds of 155 mph as of 8:00 a.m. EDT today. It will stay strong for the next few days, but should lose some steam as it gets closer to Japan later in the week. SONAR Critical Events: Super Typhoon Hagibis as of Tuesday, October 8, 8:00 a.m. EDT Hagibis could make landfall in Japan, in the southern part of the island of Honshu, late Saturday evening, Japan time. Winds at that point could be as high as 100 mph. This could have a significant impact on the ports of Nagoya and Tokyo, depending on the typhoon's ultimate track. Shippers should expect delays through lanes in the northern Philippine Sea and possibly the Sea of Japan. Look for updates on the FreightWaves website and social media accounts.

2019-10-09,Major Snowstorm Plowing Through Northern Rockies,"An early season snowstorm continues to plow through northern Rockies, lasting through tonight and early Thursday, October 9. FreightWaves has been reporting on this impending storm since the beginning of the week. Winter Storm Watches and Warnings posted by the National Weather Service (NWS) will remain posted until the storm has cleared the region. Snow Amounts and Timing Heavy snowfall will keep coming down today, October 9, across much of Montana and Wyoming. This will make travel on I-15, I-90 and I-94 very risky for truckers. The Montana Department of Transportation has already reported storm-related tractor-trailer accidents on interstates and other routes. The highest snow totals will likely be in the following areas: Beartooth and Crazy Mountains of Montana, including Cooke City which is just north of the Montana-Wyoming border on US-212; Bighorn Mountains of Wyoming, including Burgess Junction on US-14, about 50 miles west of Sheridan and I-15. These areas could get 12 to 18 inches in all. Many slopes around Helena, Great Falls, Lewistown, Bozeman, West Yellowstone, Butte, Dillon, Cody and Casper could get socked with six to 12 inches. Some valleys may only receive up to six inches, but roads in these areas will still be slick and visibility will be limited at times. SONAR Critical Events: Wednesday, October 9, 10:00 a.m. EDT Winds will gust to 40 mph in many locations, leading to occasional white-out conditions due to blowing snow. The combination of deteriorating travel conditions, along with possible downed trees and power lines, may lead to roadblocks that could last up to 24 hours. The storm is also likely to disrupt operations at several international airports and oil/petroleum facilities in the region. These are indicated by the red dots and doughnuts on the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events map above, representing a forecasted High risk of disruptions; orange represents a Medium risk. The Winter Storm Severity Index is an experimental product that summarizes many winter hazards & has recently been expanded to the entire Lower 48. It is indicating that extreme impacts are expected from parts of the Rockies & Northern Plains with the upcoming winter storm. pic.twitter.com/ejfyIQc4rf — NWS WPC (@NWSWPC) October 9, 2019 The storm will remain powerful as it moves into the Dakotas tonight, possibly lasting through Friday. Places like Bismarck, Dickinson, Minot and Rapid City will see six to 12 inches snowfall totals with wind gusts up to 50 miles per hour. Meanwhile, 12 to 18 inches will pile up in the high elevations around Sundance, Spearfish and Deadwood. After the Dakotas, the storm will make its way into western Minnesota around Friday afternoon, October 11, where the NWS has issued a Winter Storm Watch. Several inches of snow with near-blizzard/blizzard conditions are in the forecast. Other Weather Today Away from the snowstorm, strong crosswinds will give drivers problems from southeastern Idaho into the Great Basin of Nevada and Utah. Northwesterly gust of 45 to 55 mph will make deadheading risky on I-80 and I-84, as well as areas west of I-15. Severe thunderstorms could produce isolated tornadoes, damaging winds or large hail in a few spots from Wichita Falls to Kansas City and Omaha. Heavy storms could cause flash flooding in parts of the Florida Peninsula. Additional Notes Supply chains will be impacted by planned power outages today across a large portion of California. Because of very dry and windy weather, there's an extreme threat for wildfire development from Santa Barbara and Bakersfield northward to Redding. This includes the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento metropolitan areas. According to KTVU-TV, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (NYSE:PCG) has already cut off electricity to a few hundred thousand customers this morning, with total outages likely exceeding 750,000. SONAR Critical Events: Wednesday, October 9, 10:00 a.m. EDT A section of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) rail is out of service in Missouri between Moberly and Kansas City because of logjams and debris strikes to the Grand River bridge in Brunswick, Missouri.

2019-10-09,Week 40 Picks Up Where Third Quarter Left Off,"Carloads on the railroads remained under water in the first week of the fourth quarter 2019, which ended on October 5. Total traffic on U.S. railroads declined 7.1% to 515,061 carloads compared to the same week in 2018 according to the Association of American Railroads (AAR). A weaker industrial economy, loose truckload (TL) capacity and lower bulk loadings have been the primary culprits. Week 40's declines in U.S. carloads continued across all modes except for this year's top performers – chemicals (+4%) year-over-year in the week and petroleum and petroleum products (+0.5%). Double-digit declines were seen in metallic ores and metals (-14.8%), coal (-13.6%), grain (-13.2%) and motor vehicles and parts (-10.8%). Intermodal (-5.8%) remained in its depressed state. The 5.8% decline in intermodal carloads was the same level these loadings declined for all of the third quarter 2019. Excess TL capacity is keeping spot market rates depressed, narrowing the traditional gap between the cost for truck and rail service. As third quarter 2019 earnings get under way ((J.B. Hunt Transport Services, NASDAQ:JBHT), anyone with intermodal exposure likely saw a bit of a revenue headwind in the quarter. For J.B. Hunt the intermodal declines may not be as deep as what some of its competitors saw. In the third quarter, the company's main eastern rail partner, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC), reported a 3.2% year-over-year decline in container volumes while the company's western partner BNSF Railway ((Berkshire Hathaway, NYSE:BRK) reported a modest improvement (+0.6%). However, J.B. Hunt's intermodal results will be impacted by ongoing arbitration costs over its intermodal agreement with BNSF. Those intermodal providers with exposure to CSX Corp. (NASDAQ:CSX), where container volumes were down 8.7%, or Union Pacific Corp. (NYSE:UNP) that saw an 11% decline in container volumes, may have had a tougher go in the quarter. Schneider National, Inc. (NYSE:SNDR) partners with CSX in the East and BNSF in the West. Hub Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HUBG) relies on UNP for western intermodal rail service. In any event, the railroads clearly have a demand/revenue headwind in front of them as third quarter earnings season approaches. The group has cost and precision scheduled railroading (PSR) initiatives in place to mitigate some of the volume softness. The U.S. Class I railroads reported improvement in network fluidity in the quarter as velocity improved 5.9% and dwell times improved 14.6%. In week 40, total North American traffic declined 6.3% year-over-year with Canadian traffic declining 4.8%. Year-to-date, North American traffic is down 2.9% with U.S. traffic 4% lower.

2019-10-10,Record-Breaking Snowstorm Trudging Through Plains,"The snowstorm that pounded Montana and Wyoming yesterday will continue its journey across central portions of North and South Dakota today, October 10. It will produce several inches of additional snowfall through tonight in places like Bismarck, Minot, Pierre and Rapid City. What to Expect Rain, with pockets of freezing rain and sleet, will gradually change to snow in eastern sections of the Dakotas and western Minnesota late this afternoon into tonight. The snow will keep falling through at least Saturday as the low pressure system responsible for the snow stalls over the region, dumping a record-breaking 10 to 25 inches in Grand Forks, East Grand Forks, Fargo and many surrounding towns. These areas, on average, have seen no more than an inch of snow on a given early October day. For example, the daily record snowfall for today in Bismarck was 2.3 inches in 1959, and for Dickinson was 0.4 in 1932. The forecast for today calls for two to four inches in Bismarck and one to two inches in Dickinson. Bismark's record record for the snowiest month of October was 23.7 inches in 1991; for Dickinson it was 33.8 in 1995. SONAR Critical Events: Snowstorm outlook as of Thursday, October 10, 10:00 a.m. EDT The predicted three-day totals for this storm will rival those of the blizzard that hit this region on March 2-5, 1966. Many parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota were slammed with 20 to 30 inches of snowfall, setting new single storm records. News accounts vary, but unfortunately around 20 people died in the storm. Besides producing super-slick surfaces, the current storm will also whip up powerful wind gusts of 40 to 50 mph, leading to blowing snow, blizzard/white-out conditions at times, and power outages. Downed trees and power lines could lead to radblocks lasting for at least 24 hours. Driving on I-29, I-90, I-94 and surrounding secondary routes will be downright dangerous and risky for truckers. Still on track for significant, and potentially historic, October snowfall across North Dakota, with as much as 1 to 2 feet of snow and isolated heavier totals. Significant travel disruptions, power outages, and impacts to agriculture and livestock are all anticipated. pic.twitter.com/6DSY8j5UCW — NWS WPC (@NWSWPC) October 10, 2019 This storm will also cause significant disruptions to several oil facilities and international airports in the region, indicated by the red dots and doughnuts on the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events map above. These represent a forecasted High risk of disruptions; orange represents a Medium risk. Shippers should expect delays on the ground and in the air due to this major snowstorm. Winter Storm Warnings and Watches from the National Weather Service remain posted across the region into the weekend. Other weather today, October 10 A cold front extending southward from the snowstorm will produce severe thunderstorms from Dallas and Wichita Falls, Texas to Omaha and Des Moines. Watch out for areas large hail, destructive winds, flash flooding and isolated tornadoes. SONAR Critical Events: Severe thunderstorm outlook for Thursday, October 10 A low pressure system off the New England coast will produce periods of heavy rain, strong winds and coastal flooding from Long Island to Bridgeport, Boston, Nantucket and Cape Cod. Additional notes Supply chains will continue to be impacted by planned power outages across a large portion of California. Pacific Gas & Electric Company (NYSE:PCG) has shut off electricity to around 800,000 customers since yesterday. The decision was based on the extreme threat of wildfires due to very dry, windy weather from Santa Barbara and Bakersfield northward to Redding. This includes the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento metropolitan areas. The power outages may linger into Friday, October 11. SONAR Critical Events: California power outages A section of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) rail is out of service in Missouri between Moberly and Kansas City because of logjams and debris strikes to the Grand River bridge in Brunswick, Missouri.

2019-10-10,Can Precision Scheduled Railroading Save The Railroads' Third-Quarter Profits?,"As the third-quarter earnings season kicks off next week for the Class I railroads, one question will be the degree to which the railroads' safeguard themselves against lower volumes as a result of their cost-cutting measures via precision scheduled railroading (PSR). Railroads such as Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) have credited PSR, an operating model that seeks to streamline operations and schedules, enabling them to rein in costs, particularly in an environment where rail volumes have trended lower. Even though rail volumes are down and sub-seasonal for the third straight quarter, management messaging on cost control and productivity efforts remains quite favorable and is supported by both our checks and intra-quarter proxies for rail cost efficiencies (e.g., regulatory monthly headcount, weekly service metrics), said transportation analyst Bascome Majors in an October 1 research note from Susquehanna Financial Group (SFG), an investment firm. SFG has cut its estimates for earnings per share for most railroads for the third and fourth quarters of 2019 as well as for 2020, with the exception of Kansas City Southern and CSX (NYSE:CSX). The lower rail volumes in the U.S. in the third quarter could be a drag on company profits, although the railroads managed to weather the volume downturn in the second quarter through cutting costs. In the third quarter of 2019, U.S. total carloads were down 5.6% year-over-year, worse than the declines seen in the first two quarters of 2019 – -4.2% in the second quarter and -1.8% in the first quarter, FreightWaves reported last week after the Association of American Railroads released its weekly update on North American rail volumes on October 2. A weaker industrial economy, loose truckload capacity and lower bulk loadings have been the primary culprits. In 2019, railroads are facing multi-pronged challenges. Fundamental long-term structural changes – including the continued erosion of coal markets; growth in the domestic intermodal and chemical sectors; and the current disruptions to manufacturing, agricultural and international intermodal markets stemming from trade uncertainty and the evolution of consumer purchasing practices – have all required adaptation and renewed focus on basic railroad management and operational principles, said AAR Senior Vice President John T. Gray last week. As U.S. rail volumes have trended lower this year, railroads such as Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) and Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) have cut their expectations for the second half of 2019. But eastern carriers such as Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) face additional potential risk because of lower intermodal volumes and their exposure to falling export coal volumes, according to an October 7 research note from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). PSR actions could be an offset but that is probably already in numbers, the Morgan Stanley note said. The note also said the Canadian rails have an edge for potential growth opportunities, although the investment firm has relatively low expectations within the group. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-10-11,Historic Snowstorm To Keep Slamming Plains Into Weekend,"For the past two days, a major early season storm has been dumping huge amounts of snow in the northern Rockies and northern Great Plains in the U.S., and causing road closures and power outages in southern Canada. Parts of Montana like West Yellowstone, Lewistown, Homestake Pass, Helena and Pony got blanketed with 12 to 18 inches of snow. Yesterday, October 10, daily snowfall records were set at the Bismarck Airport (ICAO: BIS) – 7.1 inches – and at the National Weather Service (NWS) office in Rapid City – 2.7 inches. And there's a lot more snow where that came from. On average, over the past 30 years, these cities have seen only a trace of snow on a given mid-October day.

SONAR Critical Events: Snowstorm outlook as of Friday, October 11, 10:00 a.m. EDT The historic early season snowstorm continues its journey across the Dakotas and the northern half of Minnesota today, October 11. Truckers should avoid this region if possible and either wait out the storm or go around it. Shippers should expect significant delays on the ground and in the air since the storm will impact many interstates and secondary roads, in addition to several oil/petroleum facilities and airports in the region, including Fargo's Hector International Airport (ICAO code: FAR). These are indicated by the red dots and donuts on the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events map above which indicate a predicted High risk of supply chain disruptions. The Outlook Areas in North Dakota between I-29 and US-83 could get slammed with totals of two to three feet of snow by the time the storm fades Saturday night. Places along I-29 – Grand Forks, East Grand Forks, Fargo and surrounding towns – as well as along US-83 – Minot and Bismarck – could see eight to 18 inches. Portions of northeastern South Dakota, like Aberdeen, could receive up to 12 inches. Driving will be very risky on I-29, I-90 and I-94, full truckload or not. Here is the forecast additional snow accumulations this morning through Saturday. Blowing snow will reduce visibility and create snow drifts as winds increase today. #ndwx pic.twitter.com/VjgASIIa6y — NWS Bismarck (@NWSBismarck) October 11, 2019 Relentless wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph will create blizzard/white-out conditions in many locations. Snow drifts of several feet, along with downed trees and power lines, may lead to abundant roadblocks. Also, scattered to widespread loss of electricity is a strong possibility. The predicted totals for this storm will rival those of the blizzard that hit this region on March 2-5, 1966. Many parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota were slammed with 20 to 30 inches of snow, setting new single storm records. News accounts vary, but unfortunately around 20 people died in the storm. The NWS is keeping Winter Storm and Blizzard Warnings posted across the region at least through tomorrow afternoon, October 12. Other Weather Today, October 11 Look for scattered rain and thunderstorms from the Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes. Some storms may contain heavy rain, but large hail, damaging winds and tornadoes are not likely. Additional Notes Sections of I-5 and I-210 are closed just north of Los Angeles due to the Saddleridge Fire, which continues to spread. As of this morning, the fire covered 4,600 acres and was 0% contained, according to InciWeb. Wind gusts of 60 mph are in the forecast for the area, making the situation difficult to handle. Supply chains will continue to be impacted by planned power outages across a portion of California. According to a tweet last night, Pacific Gas & Electric Company (NYSE:PCG) has restored electricity to 426,000 customers. However, around 312,000 customers still have no power. Electricity will be restored to the remaining customers once safety patrols, inspections and necessary repairs are complete. The decision for planned outages was based on the extreme threat of wildfires due to hot, windy weather from Santa Barbara and Bakersfield northward to Redding. This includes the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento metropolitan areas. A section of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) rail is out of service in Missouri between Moberly and Kansas City because of logjams and debris strikes to the Grand River bridge in Brunswick, Missouri. Shippers operating through this area should expect delays of at least 48 to 72 hours. Some lanes and ramps of the I-10 bridge over the San Jacinto River are still closed. This is just east of Houston and is due to damage during last month's flooding from Tropical Storm Imelda. According to the Texas Department of Transportation, repairs may not be finished until early 2020. Tropical Update Super Typhoon Hagibis is still moving slowly northward through the Philippine Sea. Its maximum sustained winds are still 160 mph. Although Hagibis may lose some steam by the weekend, it should be taken seriously. SONAR Critical Events: Typhoon Hagibis on Friday, October 11, 8:00 a.m. EDT Typhoon Hagibis still poses a potential threat to Japan, possibly making landfall near Tokyo Bay on Saturday, October 12. Sustained winds this morning, EDT, were 135 mph, but could be 90 to 95 mpg at landfall. This would have a significant impact on major seaports and airports in the region. Shippers should keep track of Hagibis and expect delays of possibly a few days, at the least, depending on exactly how the storm pans out. Look for more updates through the remainder of the week on the FreightWaves website and social media accounts. Have a great day, a wonderful weekend, and be careful out there!

2019-10-14,Flood Threat Increasing Across The South,"I hope all of you had a wonderful weekend! As drivers get back to the grind today, October 14, they will, in all likelihood, run into scattered rain showers and thunderstorms from Texas to the Carolinas. The good news is that any delays should be minor. Also, most storms will not contain large hail or severe winds, but keep in mind that rain could be heavy in spots. The risk for much heavier rainfall increases tonight and will stick around for a couple of days. Flood Threat Rising Overnight drivers should prepare for higher odds of torrential rainfall and flash flooding late tonight and Tuesday as a frontal boundary stalls across several southern states. Abundant moisture from the Gulf of California and the Gulf of Mexico will spread across the region, leading to the potential development of intense rainfall and flooding. This won't affect every trucking route or stretch of highway. However, because of occasional periods of reduced visibility, drivers will have to slow down or pull over in some areas along and south of I-20 from Dallas, Texas to Florence, South Carolina. The flood threat could last into Wednesday as the front gains momentus and moves through the South, with drier weather behind it for Thursday and Friday. The National Weather Service (NWS) hasn't issued any Flood or Flash Flood Watches as of this morning, but this may change. Other Weather Today, October 14 Look for pockets of heavy rain and snow late tonight and Tuesday from eastern North Dakota across I-29 into Minnesota. This, plus recent snowmelt, will add to the ongoing flooding issues along the Red River, which flows along the North Dakota-Minnesota border. The river is at minor flood stage at Fargo and East Grand Forks, and is forecast to rise over the next few days. This may lead to roadblocks on I-29. Red River stage and forecast at East Grand Rapids, Minnesota. (Source: NOAA) Low relative humidity and dry conditions will combine with gusty winds to produce an elevated risk of wildfire development from southern Wyoming to Colorado Springs, Colorado this afternoon and evening. Crosswinds could give drivers trouble on I-25 south of Denver, while headwinds could slow down drivers heading westbound on portions of I-80 in Wyoming west of Cheyenne. SONAR Critical Events: Monday, October 14, 10:00 a.m. EDT Additional Notes A 115-mile stretch of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) track remains out of service in Missouri between Kansas City and Moberly. This is due to flooding and debris flow damage to the railroad's Grand River bridge in Brunswick, Missouri earlier this month. According to the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), all freeways, connectors and truck routes that were closed due to the Saddleridge fire just north of Los Angeles are now open. Tropical Update Tropical Storm Melissa continues to move farther away from North America, heading across the north Atlantic. Swells generated by Melissa are gradually fading along much of the U.S. East Coast, portions of the Bahamas, Bermuda and Atlantic Canada. The storm is no threat to land and has sustained winds this morning of only 40 mph, according to the latest report from the National Hurricane Center at 11:00 a.m. EDT today. However, container ship captains may still be inclined to steer around it, which could cause minor delays in ocean cargo.

2019-10-14,Goldman Sachs Cuts 2020 Transports Earnings Estimates On Industrial Weakness,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE:GS) equities analysts believe that weakness in the industrial sector of the U.S. economy will persist through the first quarter of 2020 before positively inflecting in the second quarter, leading them to cut earnings estimates for the transportation companies in their coverage universe. Analyst Jordan Alliger wrote last week in an investor note that it is just tough to ignore ongoing softness in weekly rail carloads (economically sensitive carloads -3.3% in 3Q – worsening from +0.9% in 2Q), taken together with two consecutive months of ISM below 50. Alliger's team cut 2020 earnings per share (EPS) estimates across a broad swath of transports – CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), Canadian National (TSX:CNR), Canadian Pacific (TSX:CP), FedEx Corp (NYSE:FDX), XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO), J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT), C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW), and Expeditors International (NASDAQ:EXPD). Prior to the note, Goldman's models assumed some positive freight growth in the first half of 2020. The estimate cuts reflect Goldman's conviction that the current slowdown will follow the pattern of previous industrial recessions, which typically last five to seven months, as measured by ISM data; that means that industrial activity may not begin improving until sometime in the second quarter of 2020. Goldman warned that the current estimate cuts only signify direction, and may not be the last cuts, depending on what companies can do to reduce costs and whether volumes do in fact snap back. Should we see the consumer slow sharply, or peak retail season disappoint, it would call into question our newly revised down EPS estimates for 2020 – in other words the potential for much deeper EPS cuts would arise, Alliger wrote. Goldman cut 2020 EPS by 2-4% across the railroad sector, although Norfolk Southern, on Goldman's conviction list, and Union Pacific still maintained their ‘Buy' ratings. The Canadian rails and CSX have mostly completed the cost-reduction measures in Precision Scheduled Railroading and are more vulnerable to weaker volumes. Canadian National was hit by lower crude-by-rail volumes, a delayed grain harvest, a weak lumber outlook, and a reduction in exported American coal. Canadian Pacific was affected by weak potash and the delayed grain harvest, while CSX is experiencing near-term weakness in intermodal and coal. J.B. Hunt, Alliger wrote, is set up to benefit from a tightening of truck capacity – due to new truck orders running below replacement levels – and efficiency improvements in the railroads in the second half of the year, although earnings should be softer in the first half of the year. Goldman left Hunt's 12-month price target unchanged at $116, representing just a 5.9% upside from the company's current share price of $109.52. Coming off a recent UPS management visit, Goldman left estimates and its ‘Buy' rating for the parcel integrator unchanged; the bank's price target for UPS is still $136, almost exactly where the stock opened on Monday, October 14. We still expect UPS to beneﬁt meaningfully for at least the next three quarters from greater Next Day Air volume tied to big box retailer penetration, as well as incremental Amazon business related to FDX no longer servicing this customer, Alliger wrote. This outsized domestic volume growth should help push down cost per shipment and improve operating margin. FedEx stock has been beat up due to a string of earnings misses followed by lowered guidance; Goldman's price target at $178 represents a 21% premium to the current price of the stock. Alliger mentioned a range of factors from continued integration expense around the TNT acquisition to general industrial weakness could delay margin improvement until fiscal year 2021, but that FedEx's high operating leverage is well-positioned to make the most of any recovery in volumes. The non-asset and asset-light intermediaries in Goldman's coverage – CHRW, XPO and EXPD – were all dinged on expectations for soft volumes, which will negatively offset margin expansion on lower capacity costs (whether truckload, air or container). Expeditors was the only transport tagged with a ‘Sell' rating. We make only slight adjustments to EXPD earnings outlook as the non-asset intensive model mitigates the ongoing ocean and air forwarding volumes, Alliger wrote. That said, the shares still trade at a logistics group premium at a time when China-U.S. trade is a major concern. Expeditors' price to earnings ratio was about 19x, but still below its five-year average of 21.1x. Although the stock is currently trading at $74, Goldman lowered its price target to $68 from $70. Taken together (an industrial, not consumer slowdown, easy YOY comps in 2020, and multiple compression tied to expected EPS re-set), we tie in share price performance during prior freight recessions and note: share prices tend to react favorably around the mid/back half of a contraction, Alliger concluded.

2019-10-15,"Soaking Southern Rains, Red River Flooding","Heavy rain will hit several states across the southern U.S. today, October 15. Drivers will have to be careful, and shippers should expect minor delays. Southern Soaker Occasional rounds of heavy rain from Texas to the Carolinas will reduce visibility and slow down drivers at times today and tonight. A frontal boundary will become nearly stationary across the region paired with an abundant flow of Gulf of Mexico moisture. Short bursts of excessive rainfall – three to five inches in some cases – may lead to flash flooding and possible roadblocks. SONAR Critical Events: Tuesday, October 15, 10:00 a.m. EDT This threat is mainly for areas along the I-20 corridor – from Dallas, Texas to Florence, South Carolina – and points to the south, including some of the I-10 corridor. The National Weather Service has issued a Flash Flood Watch from southeastern Arkansas and northeastern Louisiana to central Mississippi, This is indicated by the orange shaded-areas inside the red box on the Freight Waves SONAR Critical Events map above. Other areas may be added to the Watch at some point today. A few thunderstorms could also pop up across the South. Some of these storms could contain isolated spots of large hail, severe winds or a tornado. Flooding Continues in Upper Midwest A mix of rain and snow showers today and tonight will likely make flooding worse on the Red River, which flows along the North Dakota-Minnesota border. This, after snowmelt and runoff following the historic early season snowstorm last week. Several locations are at moderate/major flood stage as the river and its tributaries continue to swell, likely cresting tomorrow, October 16. SONAR Critical Events: Tuesday, October 15, 10:00 a.m. EDT Other Weather Today, October 14 Look for showers and thunderstorms across the Great Lakes later today and tonight as a low pressure system spins over the region. Large hail, severe winds and tornadoes are unlikely, but rainfall may become heavy at times. Some pockets of snow showers could develop, too. This same system will dump heavy rain across the Mid-Atlantic and New England from tomorrow afternoon through through Thursday. Flooding is possible in coastal and inland areas, and coastal wind gusts could reach 50 mph at times. Additional Notes A 115-mile stretch of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) track remains out of service in Missouri between Kansas City and Moberly. This is due to flooding and a logjam that caused the collapse of the Norfolk Southern bridge over the Grand River in Brunswick, Missouri earlier this month. The collapse of the railroad bridge has resulted in some freight volume shifting to road, specially in the Quincy market. While the logjam that took out the bridge on October 2 came from the northwest direction in the Kansas City market, SONAR data from FreightWaves shows that truckload capacity and volumes have had the greatest movement in smaller markets to the east. Following the heavy rainstorm (RAIN.UIN) on September 28, which resulted in the Grand River rising 20 feet the following day, followed by the bridge collapse, truckload capacity on mid-haul (250- to 450-mile length of haul) lanes jumped 908 basis points to 37.70%. This includes loads to Chicago and Indianapolis, main destinations on the main Norfolk Southern line. SONAR tickers: RAIN.UIN, MOTRI.UIN Quincy outbound tender volumes have increased 15.22% in the last two weeks, along with the average outbound length of haul rising 20% to 510 miles over the same timeframe. Carriers are also traveling from further afield to service the increased demand created by the bridge collapse – the average inbound length of haul has spiked 45% to 553 miles this week. According to Norfolk Southern, repairs on the Grand River Bridge could take another three to four weeks, lasting until early- or mid-November. Even though Norfolk Southern has entered into agreements with interline partners to detour freight traffic around Brunswick, shippers in the Kansas City, Jefferson City and Quincy freight markets are finding truckload capacity to service short-term demand. Tropical Update Tropical Depression Fifteen (TD-15) is lurking off the western coast of Africa, producing sustained winds of 35 mph. TD-15 should pass over/near the eastern islands of the chain WHAT CHAIN? later today. The depression may become slightly stronger, producing tropical storm conditions (winds of 39 to 73 mph) later today. Then, TD-15 will likely weaken tomorrow, fading to a remnant low by the end of the week. The depression is expected to produce rainfall totals of one to three inches across the Cabo Verde Islands. Isolated amounts of five inches are possible in the higher terrain, especially across the eastern portions of the islands. This rainfall could cause flash flooding and mudslides.

2019-10-16,Nasty Nor'easter Still On Track To Slam New England,"Whipping winds and rain Ground and air freight will likely be delayed in the Northeast as a wet Nor'easter develops later today, October 16. Since FreightWaves first reported on the potential storm yesterday, the forecast hasn't changed much. However, the National Weather Service did add a Wind Advisory from Delaware to coastal Maine, as well as a Flash Flood Watch for northern New Jersey. SONAR Critical Events: Nor'easter impact area, October 16-18 A low pressure cell over the Outer Banks of North Carolina will head to the Mid-Atlantic and New England tonight into Thursday. The worst of the storm will begin this evening as the storm quickly intensifies, likely bombing out – pressure dropping at least 24 millibars in 24 hours or less – overnight/early Thursday. This rapid pressure drop, or deepening, will lead to powerful winds because pressure and wind are directly related. Wind damage and beach erosion, as well as coastal flooding from heavy rain and storm surge will probably occur from the Delmarva Peninsula to Maine. Wind gusts of 40 to 60 mph could blow down trees and utility lines, leading to scattered power outages and roadblocks. The strongest winds and heaviest damage will likely be confined to areas from eastern Long Island to Boston, Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard, as well as the New Hampshire and Maine coasts. There is a silver lining – the Nor'easter will be a fairly quick mover and should begin to lose steam tomorrow afternoon or evening, October 17. Also, the storm won't produce a crippling blizzard, and it will be centered just enough offshore to prevent a widespread disaster across all of the Northeast. Flooding continues in upper Midwest Flooding continues on the Red River along the North Dakota-Minnesota border. This is due to runoff from recent snowmelt after last week's major storm, in addition to rainfall yesterday. The river is at moderate/major flood stage in several locations where it will crest between today and this weekend. In other spots, the river will recede. SONAR Critical Events: Wednesday, October 16, 10:00 a.m. EDT So far, no closures have been reported on I-29 due to flooding. However, a few state routes are blocked off. Other weather today, October 16 Scattered showers and thunderstorms will roll across the northern Gulf Coast, but should stay below severe limits with few, if any, areas of flash flooding. Look for periods of rain and snow across the Pacific Northwest. Winds will be strong enough to produce high surf along the coast. There's an increasing risk of wildfires sparking in Utah, southeastern Wyoming and Colorado today and tomorrow. Very dry conditions and severe drought will make it easy for fires to start. Gusty winds of 40 to 45 mph may cause new and existing fires to spread out of control. The crosswinds and headwinds may also make driving difficult on portions of I-15, I-25, I-70 and I-80. Additional notes A 115-mile stretch of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) track remains out of service in Missouri between Kansas City and Moberly. This is due to flooding and a logjam that caused the collapse of the Norfolk Southern bridge over the Grand River in Brunswick, Missouri earlier this month. The collapse of the railroad bridge has resulted in some freight volume shifting to trucks, especially in the Quincy, Illinois market.

Tropical update A disorganized cluster of thunderstorms in the Bay of Campeche, off the coast of Veracruz, Mexico, has a decent chance of becoming the next tropical depression or tropical storm. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) peggs the odds at just 30% between now and Friday morning, October 18. However, the chance increases to 50% this weekend, with the storm possibility drenching parts of the U.S. northern Gulf Coast next week. An Air Force reconnaissance plane, or Hurricane Hunter, is scheduled to investigate the disturbance this afternoon.

2019-10-18,Dangerous Weekend Flooding Possible For Gulf Coast,"Weekend Weather Woes For Florida A tropical system will threaten the U.S. Gulf Coast and I-10 corridor – from New Orleans to Clearwater – with gusty winds, heavy rain, storm surge and dangerous flooding. It begins later today, October 18, lasting through Saturday. SONAR Critical Events: Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen as of October 18, 11:00 a.m. EDT As of 11:00 a.m. EDT today, the disturbance, known as Potential Tropical Cyclone Sixteen (PTC16), was centered about 230 miles southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River. It's producing maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, which is low-end tropical storm strength, but the system lacks other characteristics – such as defined center of circulation, or eye – for it to be a named tropical storm. However, this could change. The system could also intensify before landfall Saturday, which will most likely happen in Florida between Panama City Beach and St. Marks. If PTC16 become a tropical storm, it will be named Nestor. But named or not, lives and supply chains will be disrupted this weekend, and significant flooding is likely. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued a Tropical Storm Warning for the following areas: Mississippi-Alabama border to Yankeetown, Florida Grand Isle, Louisiana to the Mouth of the Pearl River Tropical storm conditions are expected to first reach the coast within the warning area by later today. Gale-force winds of 39 to 46 mph are possible along portions of the U.S. southeastern Atlantic coast U.S. by Saturday. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) has issued a Storm Surge Warning for the following area: Indian Pass Florida to Clearwater Beach Florida According to the NHC, a Storm Surge Warning means there is a danger of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline in the indicated locations. The combination of a dangerous storm surge and the tide will cause normally dry areas near the coast to be flooded by rising waters moving inland from the shoreline. Storm surge heights could reach three to five feet above ground in the warning area. All NHC alerts are housed inside the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events platform. PTC16 is forecast to produce total rainfall accumulations of two to four inches this weekend across the central Gulf Coast, northern and central Florida, and the eastern Carolinas. Isolated amounts of six inches are possible. The silver lining – PTC16 will alleviate some of the drought conditions across the area. But, hopefully, not at a cost. Other Weather Today, October 18 Bursts of heavy snow and high winds will slow down drivers in the Washington and Oregon Cascades today and Saturday, October 19, as well as some of the northern Rockies in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. Through Saturday afternoon, 12 to 24 inches could pile up in areas such as Morton, Ashford, Packwood, Randle, Paradise, Longmire, Mount St. Helens, Wind River Valley, Chinook, Cayuse, and White Pass (on US-12). The highest amounts will likely be above 5,000 feet in elevation. SONAR Critical Events: Friday, October 18, 10:00 a.m. EDT Eight to 16 inches of snow could blanket portions of Idaho from tonight through Saturday night. This includes the Centennial Mountains, Lolo Pass (US-12), Galena Pass (SR-75), Pine Creek Pass (SR-31), Stanley and Sun Valley. Meanwhile, look for six to 10 inches in Montana at West Yellowstone, in addition to Bozeman, Raynolds and Targhee passes. Traffic stopped during snowstorm at Targhee Pass near West Yellowstone, Montana in February 2019. (Image: Donny Gilbert/FreightWaves) Strong crosswinds from the west gusting at 60 to 65 mph will give truckers a hard time on I-15 in Montana, north of Great Falls. The threat lasts through this evening. This includes areas from Conrad to Cut Bank, up to the Canadian border. Strong gusts will also spread across a large area from eastern Kansas and southeastern Nebraska into Iowa and southern Minnesota. Winds will be rough Saturday night and Sunday, October 19 and 20, from southeastern Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle. This affects sections of I-25 and I-80 from Cheyenne and Laramie to Scottsbluff. Gusts could top out at 70 mph.

2019-10-21,Severe Storm Threat Continues Across South,"Messy Monday in the South Drivers will run into thunderstorms and pockets of heavy rain across several southern states today, October 21. The cold front that helped spin up tornadoes in Dallas, Texas last night will head east, tracking across the South. Expect delays from Houston to New Orleans, northward to Memphis, Nashville and western Kentucky. Storms may contain large hail, severe winds, and isolated tornadoes. This will cause problems on portions of the I-10, I-20, I-40, I-55 and I-65 corridors. SONAR Critical Events: Monday, October 21, 10:00 a.m. EDT A Severe Thunderstorm Watch remains posted for areas in the severe weather threat zone. These National Weather Service (NWS) alerts are housed inside the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events platform shown in the map above. Snowy Out west Heavy snowfall across the northern Rockies should fade this afternoon, but not until after an additional two to five inches piles up from northern Idaho into western Montana. This will make travel quite slick on I-90 over Lookout Pass, US-12 over Lolo Pass and US-93 over Lost Trail Pass. The city of Butte could see up to two inches. Snow may return to these areas tonight. The Colorado Rockies will also get hit with heavy snowfall and gusty winds today and tonight, affecting travel through the Eisenhower Tunnel and several mountain passes. Otherwise, this storm will mainly slow down deliveries to Rocky Mountain National Park, as well as ski resorts in Aspen, Breckenridge and Vail. Whipping Winds Truckers will have to battle high winds across portions of the Dakotas into Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska and Kansas. Gusts from the northwest reaching 50 to 60 mph will make deadheading risky throg areas such as Grand Forks, East Grand Forks, Fargo, Sioux Falls, Pierre, North Platte, Des Moines and Salina.

2019-10-22,Commentary: CSX Offers The First Trip Compliance Reporting,"CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) is taking a bold transparency move. In releasing this kind of performance information, it is also at the early stages of disclosing how poor logistics delivery to customers has been in the past. But, to correct and improve, it is necessary to admit the depth of the service challenge. That's a good thing. To get oriented, what is trip compliance in CSX terminology? The purpose of Trip Plan Compliance is to measure success in meeting CSX's end-to-end commitments to moving customer railcars. The measure captures performance against the planned estimated time of arrival (ETA) commitment. (Photo credit: CSX) It is not measuring train or yard performance. Those kinds of statistics are not often directly correlated statistically to customer service. Here the focus is upon the railcar. CSX is publishing the performance-to-plan movement for every railcar and container, loaded or empty. If it is destined for a CSX on-line customer, it is captured. It is not yet an inter-line, multiple railroad carrier measurement. That might come later. Figure 1 is from CSX's current third quarter report to the investment community. Source: CSX Based upon this year-over-year plot, CSX has clearly improved its delivery record from two-thirds or less on time record to now approaching a four-fifths on time average. That is for railcar traffic of all types. The record for intermodal units of containers or trailers (Figure 2) is much better. That is to be expected since the intermodal operation has less link-to-link or yard- to-yard complexity. Source: CSX The improvement in delivery performance is important. A higher standard of reliability has long been recognized by all types of railroaders as sort of the Holy Grail pursuit if rail was to gain market share from the truck industry with its 90%-plus delivery record. Reading through the CSX investor third quarter transcripts, CSX management says that it wants to focus on market growth – including the opportunities to capture market share from trucking. This score card of trip achievement is one of the tools supporting that growth objective. Readers might ask, What will more precise railcar delivery look like when CSX achieves that objective? (Photo credit: CSX) For carload traffic movements, the principal challenge is that for every new loaded freight car trip each railcar must move from link to link across the CSX network. Each link from point A to B, and then onto the next pair of B to C locations has a probability of success. If less than 100% performance on any given link, the operational chances of achieving a near 99.999% precision like final railcar delivery is handicapped. If only one or two links and then a next train movement or a hand-off to the next train is the pattern, then the chances of a very high-performance mark are high. Thus, intermodal cars and their onboard containers can often have a relatively excellent 95% or better on-time delivery within a promised time window of about one hour or less against the scheduled ETA. A typical railcar must travel from a shipper siding to the first serving yard and then across two or more railroad yards, and then move for actual physical placement at the receiver customer sidetrack. That is where the complexity of being highly accurate day after day comes into the equation for rail carloads. Here are two scenarios presented in a simple table to illustrate the likely accuracy outcome. A six-link pattern is used in this hypothetical simulation. The overall service seen by the customer at the delivery end is in the high 80% range under the table's first Excellent scenario. Under this hypothetical calculation, each link has only a rough 2 to 3% failure rate. If that failure rate is consistent across all links, the actual average failure rate for rail carloads is likely to be somewhere in the 10 to 15% range. That is clearly not the performance that precision scheduled railroading was meant to imply. Yet, it is a big improvement from an often 30 to 40% system failure rate seen in the poor case cell rows. Under the If Poor Today scenario, the main line train performance is a baseline of 93%, and the first railcar customer pickup and delivery are achieving about 95% performance. Under those conditions, an overall system performance with six linked movements is probably in the average low 605 range. That's what the customer's supply chain sees. Table 1: Computation of Hypothetical Service Performance at Carload Level Railroad management can improve the service delivery compliance in several ways. One way is to cut out intermediate car yardings. CSX's trip compliance report is not a glossy exhibit – but it is a stake in the ground about its effort to continuously increase its on-time final delivery performance. That effort gets a BRAVO from this railroad experienced columnist. Is this the best service product to capture market share from the trucking sector? Maybe not yet. But it is a step forward in building a delivery on time as promised service. Increasing success should improve shipper and receiver confidence in the classic railcar product. CSX appears to be the first Class 1 to offer this visibility tool. How soon might other railroad carriers follow? Which company will be next? Rumors suggest the possibility of Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) or Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP). No confirmation yet as to when or how their railcar scorecard might function. For CSX and those that follow, the next step will be to make the trip compliance report a real-time current trip underway projection instead of an after the fact report card. Concluding Thoughts Technically, what's the best they could be? Moving over a complex single railroad company track network, the best nominal system-wide on-time as promised delivery to rail customers will likely end up being about 90% on-time the day of delivery. If they redesign the service with fewer intermediate yards, the performance could reach about 95% or better. However, add in the complexity of interline interchanges among say two Class 1 railroads and a shortline, and the likelihood of near-term success drops the rail carload trip compliance rate to probably below 85%. That need not be the long-term outcome, but it is difficult to assume a better achievement until the railroads fully integrate GPS functionality into their carload trip compliance software. To date, the railroads have been slow to integrate their now active new Positive Train Control network communications technology and the GPS reporting from head-end locomotives and end-of-train devices. Those data feeds can supply accuracy tracking on a real-time basis to the trip compliance customer service centers as a means of correcting any detected link-to-link deterioration of railcar movement. Which railroad will figure this all out first? References A technical scheduled railroading analysis was published 15 years ago. The 2004 study was delivered to the Federal Railroad Administration. Search on the following information for a copy: ICF Consulting & Zeta Tech Associates; Scheduled Railroading and The Viability of Carload Service; (Office of Policy Federal Railroad Administration); (Eric Beshers, Randolph Resor; and J. Blaze). The first efforts towards freight car scheduling date back further. Guerdon Sines, VP – Information and Control Systems of the Missouri Pacific Railroad conducted the initial research in 1973. Funding came from the FRA under Jim Hagen (a Missouri Pacific alumnus and later CEO at Conrail). The use of possible railcar management technology based upon continuous GPS data from locomotives using advanced train control systems was researched back in the late 1980s by BN railroad under direction of Steve Ditmeyer. Railcar management software developed in a joint venture by Conrail, Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC), and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) during 1992-96 using RFID AEI tag data was never brought to market. Their freight railcar scheduling initiatives were lost in the post mega-merger period of BN+ATSF, UP+CNE+Southern Pacific, and then the NS+CSX absorption of Conrail. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-10-22,"US Truckers To Battle Rain, Wind, Snow This Tuesday","There is plenty of disruptive weather happening today, October 22, in several regions of the U.S. Resulting delays for shippers should be minor/moderate. Driver safety will be the main concern. Stormy Mess in the East Truckers will run into wet and stormy conditions on the I-81 and I-95 corridors, from the southern Appalachians to New England. The cold front that helped spawn tornadoes in Dallas, Texas Sunday night is moving through the eastern U.S. today and tonight. But the system isn't quite as powerful as it was a couple of days ago. SONAR Critical Events: Tuesday, October 22, 10:00 a.m. EDT Rain may be heavy in some areas, but probably not heavy enough to cause much flash flooding. However, thunderstorms could produce severe winds, isolated tornadoes and spots of hail from Jacksonville and southeastern Georgia to Raleigh, Virginia Beach and the Delmarva Peninsula. The best chance for severe storms is from eastern North Carolina to near Norfolk, as shown in the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events map above. The highest rain amounts – possibly one to two inches – will likely be from upstate New York into New England. The Northeast will gradually dry out tomorrow afternoon and evening, October 23. Snowy Out West Watch out for heavy snowfall in western Montana tonight into tomorrow as a cold front moves through the region. Roads will be very slippery heading over Kings Hill Pass (US-89) and surrounding areas where four to eight inches could pile up. SONAR Critical Events: Tuesday, October 22, 10:00 a.m. EDT The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a Winter Weather Advisory, which begins this evening and lasts until noon tomorrow, MDT. The same front may produce heavy snowfall across central and eastern Colorado, as well as portions of New Mexico, on Wednesday night and Thursday. Wicked Winds Drivers will have to battle strong crosswinds of 40 to 50 mph across the Midwest, especially along I-29, I-90 and I-94. Gusts from the northwest will make it risky for deadheading. Blowovers are possible from eastern sections of the Dakotas and Nebraska into Minnesota, Iowa, southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois. This includes Grand Forks, Fargo, East Grand Forks, Fergus Falls, Sioux Falls, Sioux City, Des Moines, Omaha, Milwaukee and points just north of Chicago. SONAR Critical Events: Tuesday, October 22, 10:00 a.m. EDT Additional Notes A 115-mile stretch of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) track is still out of service in Missouri between Kansas City and Moberly. Flooding in early October led to a logjam that caused the collapse of the Norfolk Southern bridge over the Grand River in Brunswick, Missouri. The repairs may not be done until mid-November. Norfolk Southern has entered into agreements with its interline partners to detour freight traffic over alternative gateways through the duration of the outage.

2019-10-23,"High Impact Snowstorm To Slam Rockies Tonight, Thursday","A strong winter-like storm will barrel through the Rockies and southern Great Plains tonight, October 23 into Thursday, October 24. Shippers should expect delays due to significant travel issues for truckers who try to make it through the storm. A strong cold front will help trigger snowfall over the southern foothills and Palmer Divide late this afternoon and evening, followed by southern Colorado, northeastern New Mexico, and the panhandles of Oklahoma and Texas tonight. The snow will be heavy at times tonight before tapering a bit Thursday. SONAR Critical Events: Wednesday, October 23, 10:00 a.m. EDT The heaviest snowfall will blanket areas along and south of I- 70 and across the Palmer Divide. Over the I-25 corridor, most of the accumulating snowfall will be in southern areas, while further north towards Fort Collins amounts may be less than one inch. Twelve to 15 inches could pile up from the foothills of the Denver area to Pikes Peak, Monument Hill, portions of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and Wet Mountains, as well as Raton Pass and the Johnson and Bartlett mesas in New Mexico. Snowfall totals in lower slopes will range from just a couple of inches to eight or nine, depending on location and elevation. Downtown Denver and suburbs to the south and west could receive up to four inches of snow, nearly the average monthly total for October. Areas just north and east of Denver, including the Denver International Airport, will get lighter amounts. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued various winter weather alerts, housed inside the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events platform in the map above. Russell Danielson, a meteorologist with the NWS office in Boulder (which covers the Denver metropolitan area), told FreightWaves this isn't the first big snowstorm to hit the Colorado Rockies this season. About a week and a half ago, a storm dumped three to four inches of snow in Denver and six to 12 inches in the nearby mountains. For this time of year it isn't out of the ordinary, said Denielson. He went on to say that the first measurable snowfall of the season typically arrives by mid-October, so the first storm was right on target. Snowfall forecast. (Source: NWS Boulder) The impending storm is also forecast to contain wind gusts as high as 35 to 40 mph in some areas. This, combined with occasional snowfall rates of two inches per hour, will lead to blowing snow and extremely low visibility on sections of the I-25 and I-70 corridors. This includes the Eisenhower Tunnel, about an hour's drive west of Denver (in fair weather conditions) and used by many truckers. Danielson said driving conditions will be quite treacherous. Besides Denver, the storm will hit other areas in Colorado such as Aspen, Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Georgetown, Idaho Springs, Castle Rock, Breckenridge, Winter Park, Lake George and South Park. High impact storm system to bring moderate to heavy snowfall to south central and southeast Colorado this evening through Thursday. pic.twitter.com/1hGOR77ugk — NWS Pueblo (@NWSPueblo) October 23, 2019 The storm may drop two to three inches of snow along the US-54 and US-87 corridors from Guymon, Oklahoma to Amarillo, Texas. This would also affect drivers on I-40 through Amarillo. Other weather today, October 23 During daylight hours today, drivers will run into areas of scattered rain and snow showers across the Rockies and North Dakota. Look for the heaviest snowfall in the following areas: Montana on US-89 from Kings Hill Pass to Raynesford, and SR-200 from Belt to Geyser; Black Hills of northeastern Wyoming and South Dakota, including the cities of Lead, Deadwood, Four Corners and Sundance. Meanwhile, thunderstorms and heavy rain could develop in the southern Great Plains late night into Thursday. SONAR Critical Events: Wednesday, October 23, 10:00 a.m. EDT. Elevated wildfire risk areas shaded in yellow. The risk for wildfire development will increase the next couple of days across portions of California and southern Nevada. Very dry conditions and extremely gusty winds – more than 50 mph at times – could spark new fires, as well as quickly spreading new and existing fires out of control.

2019-10-23,Coal And Intermodal Declines Put Pressure On Norfolk Southern's Profits,"Declining coal and intermodal volumes contributed to a 3% drop in third-quarter profits for Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). Third-quarter net income fell 6% to $657 million, or $2.49/diluted share, compared with $702 million, or $2.52/diluted share, in the third quarter of 2018. Operating ratio was 64.9%, which is a third-quarter record, the company said when it released its results on October 23. A lower operating ratio can signal increased profitability. Third-quarter 2018's operating ratio was 65.4%. Coal volumes slumped in the third quarter, declining 14% from the third quarter of 2018. Intermodal volumes also fell, slipping 5% year-over-year. Those volume declines contributed to lower revenue for the coal and intermodal segments. The operating revenue for coal fell by 13% to $403 million, while intermodal's operating revenue slipped 5% to $707 million. Operating revenue from merchandise was flat at $1.7 billion. Meanwhile, overall third-quarter operating revenue fell 4% to $2.8 billion, with a 2% increase in average revenue partially offsetting a 6% drop in total revenue. Operating expenses also fell 4% to $1.8 billion amid lower compensation and benefits, equipment rents and fuel prices. Source: Norfolk Southern The company said a $32 million write-off of a receivable resulting from a legal dispute unfavorably impacted the operating ratio by 110 basis points and earnings per share by $0.09. Our team achieved a record third-quarter operating ratio while successfully rolling out the first phase of our TOP21 operating plan, followed by the swift transition to the plan's second phase. These efforts produced an 11% reduction in crew starts and recrews compared to the third-quarter last year, robustly outpacing the 6% volume decline while maintaining resilient service that supported an 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue per unit growth, said James A. Squires, Norfolk Southern chief executive officer. Image Sourced from Pixabay"

2019-10-24,Smorgasbord Of Weather Slowing Down Late-Week Supply Chains,"The snowstorm that began last night keeps cranking across the Rockies and southern Great Plains today, October 24, mainly south of Denver and Colorado Springs. Snowfall will remain heavy in some places, along with gusty winds, blowing snow, and white-out conditions. Shippers should expect delays, and drivers will have to be extra careful. SONAR Critical Events: Thursday, October 24, 10:00 a.m. EDT The storm dumped 19 inches of snow in Genesee, Colorado (elevation 7,648 feet) in the foothills just west of Denver. The National Weather Service (NWS) office in Boulder, which covers the Denver metropolitan area, received seven inches. The western suburbs of Denver were hit with two to six inches, while the Denver International Airport (ICAO code: DEN), just east of downtown, received only a trace. The Colorado Department of Transportation reported several accidents last night on I-70, mainly west of downtown Denver. Portions of the highway were closed for a while. Unfortunately, the storm gives freight carriers another reason not to avoid the Denver area. After having a stellar spring, Denver is now one of the worst freight markets for carriers to send their trucks. With the 14th lowest Headhaul Index (HAUL.DEN) value in the country at -31.77, based on the latest date from FreightWaves SONAR, outbound volumes have been on a steady decline since May of this year, 2019. Since the end of September, however, Denver has become much worse in terms of places to source freight, with volumes dropping almost 15% in the past month. In other words, the market has too many trucks and too little freight. Inbound volumes did drop over the past few days, but not nearly to the extent of the outbound loads, making it one of the more oversupplied areas of the country. Tender rejection rates – the percentage of electronically offered loads turned down by carriers because of better options – followed suit, plummeting from almost 4.5% on October 9 to 1.28% yesterday, October 23 – the third lowest in the U.S. SONAR Tickers: OTVI.DEN (light green), ITVI.DEN (lime green) The current snowstorm will fade in southern Colorado by early this afternoon, local time, followed by a farewell in eastern New Mexico by early this evening. Then, the storm will end in northern Texas and western Oklahoma overnight tonight. Travel will remain treacherous for truckers, even after the snow stops falling. Additional roadblocks are still possible on I-70, and new ones may pop up on I-25 from Denver into New Mexico as well as on I-40 in the Texas Panhandle. Before it's all said and done, several inches of snow will cover roads in southern Colorado's Wet Mountains and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. This will affect travel on the I-25 corridor from Walsenburg to Trinidad. In New Mexico, anywhere from two to six inches could accumulate, mainly west of I-25. Higher amounts of six to 10 inches could pile up over Raton Pass, as well as the Johnson and Bartlett mesas. Winds will be gusty, leading to blowing snow and reduced visibility. The NWS has issued a Winter Storm Warning for these areas and those mentioned in southern Colorado. These alerts are housed in the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events platform in the map above. This is the second winter-like storm of the season for the Colorado Rockies. In mid-October, a storm dumped three to four inches of snow in the Denver area and six to 12 inches in the nearby mountains. However, this will be the first snowstorm of the season for northeastern New Mexico. Other Weather Today, October 24 Firefighters are still trying to contain wildfires across California. New fires could spark, and existing fires could spread quickly due to extremely low humidity and strong Santa Ana winds gusting to 45 or 50 mph. Pacific Gas and Electric Company has issued public safety power shutoffs (PSPs) in the northern part of the state in order to prevent potentially downed power lines from sparking new fires. Smoke from fires could reduce visibility as it blows across the I-5 corridor through the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys. SONAR Critical Events: Thursday, October 24, 10:00 a.m. EDT Thunderstorms, heavy rain and localized flash flooding will slow down drivers from portions of central and eastern Texas to Tulsa, Oklahoma and Fayetteville, Arkansas. A few storms may contain large hail and severe winds. The threat for severe storms and flash flooding shifts to Louisiana and Mississippi on Friday, October 25, then to the Ohio Valley on Saturday, October 26. SONAR Critical Events: Thursday, October 24, 10:00 a.m. EDT Finally, high crosswinds will make deadheading quite risky across portions of central and western Montana tonight and Friday. Even drivers with full truckloads may have problems. Gusts will reach 60 to 85 mph along the I-15 and I-90 corridors through Butte, Bozeman, Helena and Great Falls, in addition to US-2 from Cut Bank to Havre. Additional Notes A 115-mile stretch of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) track is still out of service in Missouri between Kansas City and Moberly. Flooding in early October led to a logjam that caused the collapse of the Norfolk Southern bridge over the Grand River in Brunswick, Missouri. Norfolk Southern officials say the repairs will be finished no later than November 6, 2019.

2019-10-25,"Drenching Rains, High Winds, Fire Dangers This Weekend","Wind, rain and snow could slow drivers a bit in several regions of the U.S. today, October 25. The messy weather continues into the weekend. Pesky Plains Extremely strong crosswinds will continue to make deadheading quite risky across portions of central and western Montana through this evening. Even drivers with full truckloads may have problems. Gusts could reach 60 to 80 mph along the I-15 and I-90 corridors through Butte, Bozeman, Helena and Great Falls, in addition to US-2 from Cut Bank to Havre. Pilots will have a rough road ahead, too. So, some air cargo may be slightly delayed at Great Falls International Airport (ICAO code: GTF). SONAR Critical Events: Friday, October 25, 10:00 a.m. EDT Then, a fairly quick burst of moderate to heavy snowfall will hit northwestern Montana tonight, fading by early afternoon Saturday, October 26. This will affect travel mainly along US-2 from Essex to Marias Pass, SR-200 from Bonner to Greenough, and US-12 from Garrison to Elliston and over McDonald Pass, in addition to roads through the Butte area. The snowfall, along with very gusty winds from the north, will spread across Wyoming the remainder of Saturday afternoon and evening. Truckers will have to be extra careful on the I-25 and I-90 corridors. Bowing snow will reduce visibility at times due to near white-out conditions. Snow will also creep into portions of South Dakota and north of I-80 in Nebraska. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a High Wind Warning and winter weather alerts for the soon-to-be affected areas. All NWS alerts, as well as potentially impacted assets like airports and oil facilities, are housed inside the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events platform as seen on the featured maps. Soggy South Periods of heavy rain will drench the lower Mississippi and Tennessee valleys today and tonight, moving into the Ohio and middle Mississippi valleys on Saturday. Two-day totals of three to six inches are possible from Baton Rouge to Mobile, northward to Memphis and eastern Arkansas. ONAR Critical Events: Friday, October 25, 10:00 a.m. EDT These areas are under a Flash Flood Watch from the (NWS. Localized flash flooding could lead to roadblocks along the I-10, I-20 and I-55 corridors. Flash flooding may also cause problems from western Kentucky and southern Illinois up to the Indianapolis metropolitan area. While flooding may be an issue, the wet weather will quench the South's thirst for much needed rainfall. Many parts of the region are still suffering from severe to extreme drought. This round of rain won't wipe out the drought, but it will steer the situation in the right direction. In addition to the rain, a few severe thunderstorms could pop, producing isolated tornadoes and large hail from New Orleans and Baton Rouge into southern Mississippi. Other Weather Today, October 25 High winds and hot, dry conditions in California will continue to make it difficult for crews to contain wildfires across the state. This will be a significant issue through the weekend. High Wind Watches and Warnings, in addition to Red Flag Warnings, remain posted from San Diego to Los Angeles, as well as in Northern California across the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys. SONAR Critical Events: Friday, October 25, 10:00 a.m. EDT Several homes are burning this AM in #CanyonCountry from the #TickFire right now.

2019-10-28,"Heavy Snow To Slam Rockies, Plains, Midwest This Week","Cold, snowy weather will be the rule rather than the exception across many states the next few days, leading up to Halloween. While an all-out blizzard is unlikely – with roads closed and power outages for days – travel will be tough for truckers at times, and shippers should expect some minor delays in freight movement. Other parts of the U.S. remain dry and threatened by wildfires, while some will see the return of soggy conditions. Snowy Situation Heavy snow – up to 12 inches in some high elevations – and strong, gusty winds will spread across the Rockies today and tonight, October 28. Expect delays over mountain passes and some interstate stretches from Montana and Idaho to Wyoming and Colorado, including the Denver metropolitan area. SONAR Critical Events: Monday, October 28, 10:00 a.m. EDT It will be important for truckers to pour winter additive into their diesel. Record low temperatures below zero are possible in the coldest locations of the Rockies the next few mornings, October 29-31. Daytime highs will struggle to warm past the single digits or teens above zero. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued various winter weather alerts in the region, which are housed inside the FrieghtWaves SONAR Critical Events platform in the map above. Some of the snow will move into the Great Plains and Great Lakes this evening, ending by early Tuesday. Some spots from northern Missouri and eastern Iowa to Green Bay and Michigan's Upper Peninsula will receive three to six inches. Then, Mother Nature may scare up a more potent snowstorm across the Great Plains and Midwest on Wednesday and Thursday, October 30 and 31. Computer models indicate up to 12 inches of total snowfall could wreak some havoc from northern Missouri and eastern Iowa to northern Illinois (north of Chicago) and southern Wisconsin. The NWS will probably begin issuing a Winter Storm Watch by sometime tomorrow. Wet Weather Periods of heavy rain will come back to areas from the Gulf Coast to the Northeast later in the week, mainly Thursday and Friday, October 31 and November 1. Some parts of the Southeast could get doused with three to five inches of rainfall and localized flash flooding. This, after soaking rains, strong thunderstorms and flash flooding hit the region over the weekend. Other Notable Weather Wildfires across California continue to disrupt local businesses and supply chains, including those in the San Francisco, Sacramento and Los Angeles metropolitan areas. Around one million customers across the state have no electricity, mainly because of Pacific Gas and Electric Company's public safety power shutoffs (PSPs). SONAR Critical Events: Monday, October 28, 10:00 a.m. EDT The risk for new fires sparking and existing fires to spread quickly remains elevated due to relentless winds and extremely dry air. Road closures are possible due to the proximity of some fires and thick smoke to interstates. Strong winds may delay air cargo at Ontario International Airport (ICAO code: ONT), Sacramento International Airport (ICAO code: SMF), Bob Hope Airport (ICAO code: BUR) and Los Angeles International Airport (ICAO code: LAX). Additional Notes Norfolk Southern Railway (NYSE:NSC) service remains suspended in Missouri from Kansas City to Moberly – a 115-mile stretch. Flooding in early October caused a logjam that led to the collapse of the railway's bridge over the Grand River in Brunswick, Missouri. Norfolk Southern officials now say that repairs will be finished ahead of schedule, no later than tomorrow, October 29. The company has entered into agreements with its interline partners to detour freight traffic over alternative gateways through the duration of the outage. Tropical Update Super Cyclonic Storm Kyarr continues to spin over the Arabian Sea, producing winds of 150 mph around its eyewall. The storm should weaken by the time it brushes by the Oman coast later this week, with winds of 80 to 90 mph. SONAR Critical Events: Super Cyclonic Storm Kyarr, Monday, October 28, 8:00 a.m. EDT While Kyarr may stay centered offshore, high waves and gusty winds could slow down local and regional supply chains on the southern Arabian Peninsula, as well as container ships trying to move through shipping routes in the area.

2019-10-29,Commentary: Before CN Or CSX Tried PSR…,"Before the Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) or CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) rolled out precision scheduled railroading (PSR) under the leadership of the late E. Hunter Harrison, a much smaller terminal railroad company in the eastern United States was demonstrating aggressive cost reduction. It was Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail). What Was Conrail? Actually, there were two companies named Conrail. The first was created by the U.S. Congress (the January 1974 3-R Act) as part of the federal effort to restructure the re-organizable assets of failed railroads like Penn Central. That larger network version of Conrail went into operation service on April 1, 1976. Among its cost reduction achievements were these. Original Conrail PSR-like Improvements, 1977 – 1999: Reduced work force (from about 94,000 in 1977 to about 20,000) Reduced major railroad yards from more than 250 to fewer than 50 Reduced track miles by about half (from 40,700 miles to 20,940 miles) Reduced locomotive fleet by more than 57% Eliminated a $350 million operating loss Reported positive operating income of $500 million by 1985 Improved enterprise efficiency (operating ration) from 109+ to a relatively efficient 79.9 for the 1990s era All of this was accomplished as the company resized its asset base to better serve a market demand that went down from more than 400 million annual tons of freight traffic to less than 200 million tons between about 1976 and 1981. Conrail as the Current Terminal Operation? As part of the last of the mega-sized railroad mergers, key parts of Conrail were absorbed into Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and CSX. What remained of Conrail became a terminal company co-owned by the two railroads and renamed Conrail Shared Assets (CSAO). The creation of CSAO was a condition of the merger approval process before the federal railroad regulatory agency, the Surface Transportation Board (STB). That restructuring into a terminal railroad company occurred effectively during the summer of 1999. This terminal Conrail is a ‘neutral' terminal or switching road, that operates as a cost center. It performs car switching and yard classification work for its two owners, Norfolk Southern and CSX. It does not bill shippers or participate in the waybill. Strictly speaking, it serves as the railway local operating agent for its two owners. Where? Conrail Shared Assets' train operation primarily covers just under 500 track miles in the northern New Jersey region that is part of the New York City urban area, plus another approximately 370 track miles in the Philadelphia metropolitan region to the south. The northern New Jersey CSAO service area map CSAO Philadelphia service area map CSAO's Local Benefits? In the years that followed the breakup of the original Conrail, the new terminal operation worked to increase the level of two-railroad service competition offered to railroad shippers. The original Conrail had served more than 80% of the highly urbanized East Coast market under its original 1974 Congressional charter. Neither CSX nor Norfolk Southern in those years had direct service contact with those shippers. In some ways, this was a form of open access local freight service. The simple translation is that freight customers in these terminal areas have a choice of using either NS or CSX main line routings or prices between the many NS- and CSX-served remote origin or destination markets. Another benefit is that when a single entity like CSAO performs the terminal switching service, the unit costs within a congested geographic area like northern New Jersey or Philadelphia are lower than if each Class 1 railroad company performed its own train movements. Beyond freight car placement and pick-up service, CSAO also helps Amtrak and New Jersey Transit operate some of those passenger trains over CSAO-owned and -maintained tracks. How Is It Working for Rail Freight and Passenger Customers? A limited circulation report suggests that by about 2016, the provided service metrics were pretty good. CSAO switching of freight cars at customer locations was in excess of 94% of customer expectation. That's remarkably high compliance. Train departure service provided by CSAO was typically in the 90% to 92% range according to one report. Freight car yard dwell time across the CSAO network was less than 20 hours. In contrast, yard dwell times at many Class 1 systems yards was often in the 24- to more than 30-hour range according to a survey of STB metric reports. The results have been impressive at a practical level. Between the first full base year of 2000 and 2014, Conrail Shared Asset managers have produced the following productivity gains. Conrail Shared Assets Terminal Benefits (2000-2014): Number of shippers served has increased Route miles decreased by about 3% Locomotives required down by about one-third Only about 90 locomotives required Employees required for the service is down by approximately one-third Derailments incidents are down by about two-thirds Railroad employee injuries reduced by more than one-third Conclusions Consolidation of complex railway terminal operations under a unified operating command structure clearly works and delivers both cost improvements as well as service and safety benefits. That's important, since strategically the next big hurdle in improving overall railway freight efficiency in the PSR era is likely to be within these complex yards and industrial areas. At least two of the Class 1 railroads have separately admitted that yard operating improvements are the next front for continued productivity gains. Therefore, reorganizing the improvements made under the Conrail terminal changes should provide lessons for rail management and regulators in the next decade. PSR cost reduction results are not unique to the current business model offered by six of the current seven Class 1 North American railroads. The only significant difference is that the cash flow savings from a terminal operation flow directly to the owning railroad companies (in this case CSX and NS) rather than to shippers as lower rates or to investors as dividends. Acknowledgements In memory of the documentation work of both Roy Opitz and Gardner Rogers during their Conrail years. Productivity gains during the original Conrail operating period occurred under the stewardship of Ed Jordan, Stanley Crane, Jim Hagen and David LeVan. Part of the management improvement concepts embedded into the Conrail culture were introduced by Ram Charan. Ram believed in a balance in the business of serving customers, the need for financial improvement and an investment in developing Conrail's human talent. (I had the privilege of periodically reporting on projects to each of these leaders during my 21-year Conrail career.) The Conrail Shared Assets PSR-like productivity improvements occurred during the leadership of Ron Batory (now head of the Federal Railroad Administration). Image Sourced from Pixabay.

2019-10-29,"Snow, Wind, Bitter Cold From Rockies To Plains","A big blast of snow and wind will continue across parts of the Rocky Mountains the rest of today, October 29, lasting into tonight as an arctic cold front moves through the region. Hazardous road conditions, as well as blowing snow and near white-out conditions will result in potential delays in trucking and air freight. Snowy, Wind, Bitter Cold Six to 12 inches could pile up in the Denver metropolitan area, with higher amounts in the surrounding foothills. Not too big of a deal for this part of the country, but drivers should expect delays on I-70 and I-25. Places such as Georgetown, Rocky Mountain National Park and the Eisenhower Tunnel could see up to 16 inches, with wind gusts of 35 mph. Parts of Wyoming will receive several more inches of snow along with wind gusts up to 55 mph. This is mainly for Sweetwater County – including Wamsutter, Rock Springs and Green River – in addition to the southern Laramie Range. Also, in Sweetwater County, bitterly cold wind chills of 30° to 35° below zero will develop overnight. SONAR Critical Events: Tuesday, October 29, 10:00 a.m. EDT Heavy snow and strong winds will strike the Wasatch Mountains in Utah, with several inches possible in the Salt Lake City area – including Provo and Park City – as well as spots to the south like Scofield, Cove Fort, Koosharem and Fish Lake. Even in areas of less intense snowfall, the National Weather Service (NWS) is warning of considerable blowing and drifting snow because of ferocious winds. Overnight into Wednesday, October 30, snow and freezing drizzle will spread into the Great Plains and Midwest. This includes parts of Kansas and Nebraska to Davenport, Iowa, northern Missouri, Milwaukee, and possibly downtown Chicago. A more potent shot of snow and wind will hit the same general areas on Halloween afternoon and evening. Snow totals of three to six inches will be common with the Halloween storm, but there could be areas that receive up to 10 inches. Blowing and drifting snow will reduce visibility on the I-80, I-88 and I-90 corridors. Winds may knock down trees and utility lines, resulting in scattered power outages. The storm may also delay harvest of corn and soybeans in the Midwest, stress livestock, and cause logistical issues for commodities in the region. Other Weather Today, October 29 On the warm side of the western snowstorm, thunderstorms and heavy rain will develop from eastern Texas to the middle Mississippi River Valley, as well as in portions of the Southeast. The (NWS) has not yet issued a Flash Flood Watch for any particular area, but localized flooding is possible from Dallas to Tulsa and northwestern Arkansas; and from Memphis to New Orleans, Mobile, Tallahassee and Macon. Additional Notes: Wildfires continue to burn in California. When FreightWaves first reported on this yesterday, October 28, the largest fire – the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County – was spread across 66,000 acres of northern California's wine country. Last night it increased to more than 74,000 acres. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), the cause of the Kincade Fire is under investigation. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has closed several ramps on US-101 between Larkfield-Wikiup and Simi. The Getty Fire started yesterday near the Getty Center in Los Angeles. Some interstate ramps/lanes are still closed on I-405 (known as the 405) in Los Angeles, from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard. Wildfires are burning in 10 other locations across the state. Additional road closures are possible. The threat for fires spreading or new ones starting is at critical to extreme levels. Very dry and windy conditions will persist for at least a couple more days, through October 30. Gusts could reach 60 mph or more in some areas, with afternoon relative humidity of less than 20%. SONAR Critical Events: Tuesday, October 29, 10:00 a.m. EDT Around half a million customers across California still have no electricity, mainly because of Pacific Gas and Electric Company's public safety power shutoffs (PSPs). The PSPs are meant to prevent live power lines from starting new fires if those lines were blown down by the vicious winds. The NWS has posted new Red Flag Warnings across portions of northern and southern California. These warnings, along with the areas under the PSPs, are housed inside the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events platform on the map directly above. In addition to potential ground transportation issues, strong winds may delay air cargo at San Francisco International Airport (ICAO: SFO) and Sacramento International Airport (ICAO code: SMF), as well as Los Angeles International Airport (ICAO code: LAX) and Ontario International Airport (ICAO code: ONT). Additional Notes Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) train service in Missouri, between Moberly and Kansas City, resumed yesterday evening, October 28. Logjams caused by flooding collapsed the railway's bridge over the Grand River earlier this month. Repairs have been finished, and trains scheduled through these areas are now operating on normal schedules. Customers do not need to update any shipping instructions and can view all shipment routing and ETAs via AccessNS. Tropical Update SONAR Critical Events: Super Cyclonic Storm Kyarr, Monday, October 28, 8:00 a.m. EDT Very Severe Cyclonic Storm Kyarr continues to spin over the Arabian Sea, producing winds of 120 mph around its eyewall. The storm should continue to lose steam as it glides by the Arabian Peninsula over the next several days. Kyarr will not likely make direct landfall, but coastal areas of Oman and Yemen may experience some minor storm surge and gusty winds. Short-term disruptions at ports are possible.

2019-10-29,US Rail Headcount Reaches New Low,"In September, the U.S. operations of the Class I railroads employed the fewest number of workers in years, according to data from the Surface Transportation Board. The railroads had 136,865 employees on their rosters in September, which is the lowest monthly total in 2019 and the lowest total since January 2012, which is the earliest monthly data that FreightWaves has available. September's total is 7.6% lower than September 2018 and down 1.7% from August 2019. Train and engine (T&E) employees, which is a category that can be more responsive to rail demand, was also at its lowest level in 2019, at 57,115. This total is 8.8% lower than September 2018 and 2.35% lower than August. September's slump in headcount comes as U.S. rail volumes have trended downward all this year amid a weaker industrial economy and U.S. trade uncertainty. Year-to-date, U.S. rail traffic through September 30 totaled 20.25 million carloads and intermodal units, a 3.9% decrease from the same period in 2018, according to data from the Association of American Railroads. Similar to past periods when rail volumes down, the Class I railroads looked at their headcount levels as one way to trim costs. Almost all of the Class I railroads have also deployed some form of precision scheduled railroading, an operating model that seeks to cut costs as a result of streamlined operations. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) said earlier this month that it reduced its T&E employees by 14% in the third quarter compared with the same quarter in 2018, which has resulted in its lowest headcount level ever for T&E employees. A big part of that [headcount decline] is structural. There have been reductions associated with volume and then you could moderate that as volume goes up or down, said Norfolk Southern's Chief Financial Officer Cindy Earhart during her company's third-quarter earnings call on October 23. Earhart was referring to headcount in 2019 falling by 3,200 compared with 2018. As Norfolk Southern heads into 2020, company initiatives will result in headcount falling even further, Earhart said. But even if rail volumes eventually improve, the focus on improving efficiencies as well as automating certain operations and processes could result in a future in which rail volume growth might not necessarily correlate with headcount growth. For instance, Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) said during its third-quarter earnings call on October 23 that it expects the company's rail volumes to improve in 2020. Meanwhile, the railway's headcount will be flat to slightly higher, CP executives said. When we guided in terms of headcount, well, we're not going to a one-for-one volumes… we'll be able to take on [volume] growth…[and] bring it to the bottom line by adding cars to existing traffic as opposed to adding a huge amount of headcount on the non-T&E side, said Nadeem Velani, CP's chief financial officer.

2019-10-30,Midwest Bracing For Halloween Snowstorm,"Mother Nature is about to scare up a snowstorm in some Midwestern states beginning later today, October 30. Not a major storm for most areas in the impact zone, but it will be enough to cause some trouble. Truckers will have to deal with a lot of slick roads, and the winds will pick up. Shippers should expect minor/moderate delays on the ground and in the air. Halloween Hassle Snow showers will continue during the day and into early evening from eastern Colorado into the Great Plains, between I-40 in the Texas Panhandle and I-80 in Nebraska. Then, a band of heavy snowfall will develop late this afternoon through this evening from around Kansas City and northern Missouri into much of Iowa, from Des Moines to Davenport. This will keep going through the night. Late tonight, heavy snow will gradually spread into Wisconsin and northern Illinois, mostly from north of downtown Chicago to Rochester, Madison, Milwaukee and Green Bay. SONAR Critical Events: Wednesday, October 30, 10:00 a.m. EDT Major interstates likely to be affected include I-39, I-80, I-88 and I-90. Impacts will include reduced speeds and prolonged slow-downs. A small portion of I-70 east of Kansas City is on the edge of the impact zone, and transportation there is likely to see some minor delays. Precipitation may start as sleet or freezing drizzle in some areas before changing to snow, leading to icy roads. The highest snowfall totals through tonight – potentially seven to 10 inches – may occur along a 150-mile stretch from around Kirksville, Missouri to around Peoria, Illinois. Totals of two to five inches will be more common. Wind gusts up to 30 mph will produce blowing snow and limited visibility at times for drivers. Winds may also delay air cargo at O'Hare International (ICAO code: ORD), Midway International (ICAO code: MDW) and Rockford International (ICAO code: RFD) airports in Chicago, as well as General Mitchell International Airport (ICAO code: MKE) in Milwaukee. These are indicated by the red dots and donuts in the FreightWaves SONAR Critical Events map above. Some power outages are possible as a result of the winds and areas of heavy snow. Also, this early season winter storm will likely delay the harvest of corn and soybeans in the Midwest, stress livestock, and cause logistical issues for grains and other commodities within the area. Snow totals of three to six inches will be common with the Halloween storm, but there could be areas that receive up to 10 inches. Blowing and drifting snow will reduce visibility on the I-80, I-88 and I-90 corridors. Winds may knock down trees and utility lines, resulting in scattered power outages. Other Weather Today, October 30 Meanwhile, on the warm side of the storm, areas of heavy rain this afternoon and evening will drench parts of the Arklatex region, as well as the Tennessee, Ohio, and lower and middle Mississippi River valleys. Totals through tonight could reach two to three inches in some places. Localized flash flooding is possible in places such as Texarkana, Memphis, Louisville, Huntsville, Atlanta, Chattanooga, Knoxville, Charlotte, and Greenville, South Carolina. Risk of flash flooding from October 30, 7:00 a.m. EDT to October 31, 7:00 a.m. EDT. (Source: NOAA) Public safety power shutoffs (PSPs) continue in California as wildfires, dry conditions and strong winds persist across the state. As of early this morning, around 475,000 Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) customers still had no electricity. That is an improvement, however, from nearly a million customers without power earlier this week. The PSPs issued by PG&E are meant to prevent live power lines from starting new fires if those lines were to be blown down by the vicious winds. The largest fire – the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County – started on the evening of October 23. It has increased in size to almost 77,000 acres, spreading across northern California's wine country. This is compared to around 66,000 acres yesterday, October 29. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), the cause of the Kincade Fire is under investigation. The fire got its name because it started near John Kincade Road and Burned Mountain Road, northeast of Geyserville. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has posted several closures on US-101 from Larkfield-Wikiup to Geyserville – a distance of about 16 miles. Winds should die down in northern California by this evening. But until then, gusts of 30 to 50 mph will make it difficult for crews to control the fire, which is only 15% contained. SONAR Critical Events: Wednesday, October 30, 10:00 a.m. EDT The Getty Fire started on October 28 near the Getty Center, just west of Beverly Hills. It's much smaller than the Kincade Fire – about 100 times smaller – and winds in the immediate vicinity of the fire should be tame enough for firefighters to maintain control. However, ferocious Santa Ana wind gusts are forecast to reach 70 or 80 mph in nearby canyons and valleys. Due to the proximity of the Getty fire and its smoke to I-405 (known locally as the 405), some ramps/lanes on the highway are still closed, from Mulholland Drive to Sunset Boulevard. Wildfires are burning in at least nine other locations in California. Additional road closures are possible. The threat for fires spreading or new ones starting is at extreme levels, the highest category assigned by the National Weather Service (NWS). Besides the winds, afternoon relative humidity will drop below 20% in many areas, creating a virtual tinder box in which fires can spark. Conditions should improve in southern California by late this evening/overnight. Hopefully, this will give firefighters an upper hand. In addition to potential ground transportation issues, strong winds may delay air cargo at San Francisco International Airport (ICAO: SFO) and Sacramento International Airport (ICAO code: SMF), as well as Los Angeles International Airport (ICAO code: LAX) and Ontario International Airport (ICAO code: ONT). Additional Notes Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) train service in Missouri, between Moberly and Kansas City, has resumed. Logjams, caused by major flooding, collapsed the railway's bridge in Brunswick over the Grand River earlier this month. Repairs have been finished, and trains scheduled through these areas are now operating on normal schedules. Customers do not need to update any shipping instructions and can view all shipment routing and ETAs via AccessNS. Tropical Update SONAR Critical Events: Super Cyclonic Storm Kyarr, Wednesday, October 30, 8:00 a.m. EDT The India Meteorological Department is still categorizing Kyarr as a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm. It continues to spin over the Arabian Sea, producing winds of 105 mph around its eyewall, compared to 120 mph yesterday. The storm should continue to lose more steam as it glides by the Arabian Peninsula over the next several days. Although Kyarr will likely remain offshore, its impact extends onto land. FreightWaves spoke to two ship agents in the region. Shipping operations at ports along the coast of Oman, which includes several important container trans-shipment ports along with oil and gas facilities, are reported to be closed due to heavy swells of 13 to 20 feet (approximately four to six meters), as well as heavy wind and rain.

2019-11-12,Unions Criticize Practice Of Furloughing In The Rail Industry,"Some rail unions are becoming more vocal about the rail industry's practice of furloughing employees, saying the cuts in staffing that have resulted because of precision scheduled railroading (PSR) are stretching the workforce too thin. Mass layoffs have been a disturbing and central component of PSR operations… Railroads may want us to believe these workers are extraneous, but it has become clear that reductions are simply about cutting costs, even if those cuts result in the degradation of safety, said the October 29 policy statement of the Transportation Trades Department (TTD) of the AFL-CIO, which is a coalition of 33 member unions. Workers who remain have been forced to do more with less, and are faced with discipline or dismissal if they refuse to comply. The consequences of these choices are no longer hypothetical. Furloughing employees is a long-standing practice of the freight railroads and serves as a means of adjusting staffing levels to meet demand. Furloughs, which typically involve unionized workers, can occur seasonally, such as maintenance-of-way employees working in larger numbers in the non-winter months. For instance, furloughs typically increase right before Christmas every year because the railroads pare down their operations after the fall peak shipping period. Employees expect to be furloughed at certain points throughout the year and adjust their budgets accordingly. Furloughs can also occur if a freight railroad experiences lower rail volumes, as the Class I railroads have in 2019. From a railroad's perspective, furloughing employees enables the railroad to bring back employees should volume return, instead of having to find employees and having them undergo a training program that can last at least six months if not more. In contrast, layoffs typically occur to non-agreement staff, such as those working at headquarters or in management. But furloughs and layoffs have increased as almost all of the Class I railroads have adopted PSR. PSR seeks to streamline a railroad's operations by running longer trains on a fixed schedule. Another goal of PSR is to cut a railroad's costs. The combination of weaker traffic levels and a focus on precision scheduled railroading principles that strive to maximize the efficiency of the operation have each played a role in the aggressiveness of carriers to use furloughs in the present cycle, said Todd Tranausky, vice president of rail and intermodal services for FTR Transportation Intelligence, a consulting firm. Tranausky pointed to October data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that rail transportation jobs have declined nearly 8% compared with October 2018. The transportation sector was also the fastest contracting sector, beating out even motor vehicle parts and manufacturing, which was impacted by a strike during the month, Tranausky said. FreightWaves has reported previously how headcount levels at the U.S. Class I railroads have fallen to their lowest levels in 2019. The unions and the railroads acknowledge that recent furloughs are partly the result of operational changes brought about by PSR. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) last week confirmed it furloughed 95 employees in Altoona, Pennsylvania, and 58 employees in Chattanooga, Tennessee, while Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) recently closed its Neff Yard in Kansas City, Missouri, and moved the Neff Yard's operations to other facilities nearby. Norfolk Southern (NS) said the furloughs are related to the company's organizational realignment that was announced earlier this year. Consistent with our strategic plan and current business levels, our ability to streamline operations and use fewer locomotives has required the difficult but necessary decision to reduce our locomotive mechanical forces due to the decreased demand for locomotive maintenance and repair. Norfolk Southern will continue to evaluate staffing needs as our business evolves, NS said. The company added that furloughed employees might have the opportunity to apply for other positions. In today's rapidly changing environment, Norfolk Southern continues to focus on ensuring that we have the optimal number of people and assets at every location across our system in order to operate safely and efficiently. As we execute our new strategic plan, we expect that targeted hiring and furloughing will remain components of our operating model, NS said. Meanwhile, Union Pacific (UP) said it closed the Neff Yard as a result of its efforts to streamline operations. Union Pacific values safety above all else, and our employees understand we will not sacrifice the well-being of our team for productivity. Work conducted at Neff Yard was transferred to nearby facilities that handle rail cars with the same necessary safety protocols and inspections, UP said. Unions Voice Concerns About PSR's Impact On Employees But rail unions are questioning whether the furloughs are justified, especially in light of the higher profits and the lower operating ratios that have occurred as a result of PSR. These concerns also come as the railroads and the unions are about to undergo negotiations to modify collective bargaining agreements. Despite taxpayer dollars and tax cuts helping Union Pacific gain more per share for Wall Street, their way to say ‘thanks' seems to be, pack up and go, said Ty Dragoo, legislative director for Kansas for the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation union – Transportation Division, also known as SMART-TD. Dragoo was referring to UP's closure of the Neff Yard and the closure's ensuing job losses. This is leaving behind an economic catastrophe for impacted communities to clean up for themselves. To add insult to injury, the company didn't even have the decency to warn employees until a few days out. Dragoo continued, These job losses will ripple through the heart of the local economy. Without income and security, workers and families won't be able to spend on clothes, restaurants, recreation and much more. Union Pacific isn't only undermining workers and families, but entire regional economies. Meanwhile, the TTD said the workers that have remained after jobs have been cut are being stretched too thin. As carriers that have prescribed to PSR run fewer trains, understaffed shop craft facilities are reporting increasingly idle locomotives and equipment, but lack the workforce to keep the equipment in a state of good repair. In some cases, carriers are closing facilities entirely, increasing the workload for employees elsewhere who are already overwhelmed, TTD's October policy statement said. Carriers are also compensating for reduced staffing by requiring remaining employees to perform work outside their craft in addition to fulfilling their regular duties. At best, this may involve employees performing tasks with which they are not experienced. At worst, employees may be forced to do work for which they are not qualified, the statement continued. Furthermore, rather than maintaining appropriate staffing levels, carriers are mandating overtime for workers who are already stretched thin. In an industry where fatigue is a constant risk factor, exposing employees to additional fatigue by asking them to work longer and faster while performing multiple jobs is a recipe for disaster. With shippers also airing their concerns about some of the effects of PSR before the Surface Transportation Board earlier this year, the TTD policy statement questioned whether the U.S. government should be more involved in providing a check and balance to the railroads' PSR efforts. PSR works for the few – wealthy investors who have little concern for anything other than their bottom lines. These investors are fickle, and when they have extracted every last cent out of the railroad industry, they will move on to the next sector. Meanwhile, we will be left with a hollowed-out system that does not serve its customers, has abandoned safety, and has pushed out thousands of skilled workers who may never return, the statement said. This trajectory can be changed, but doing so will require active engagement from Congress and federal safety and economic regulators, as well as a serious rethinking of operational strategy from freight rail carriers. TTD calls on them to reverse the damage caused by PSR before it becomes too late. Image by David Mark from Pixabay"
2019-11-20,US Rail Volumes Slump In Flat Peak Season,"Year-to-date U.S. rail volumes slipped again the week ending Nov. 16 amid industry observations that the peak season this year was muted for rail. U.S. rail traffic for the first 46 weeks of the year fell 4.5% to 23.8 million carloads, and intermodal units compared with the same period in 2018, according to the Association of American Railroads. Of that total, U.S. carloads slipped 4.4% to nearly 11.6 million carloads while U.S. intermodal units were down 4.6% to 12.2 million intermodal containers and trailers. On a weekly basis, the U.S. rail operations of the Class I railroads originated 501,249 carloads and intermodal units, an 8.4% drop from the comparable week in 2018. Of that, U.S. carloads fell 8.9% to 239,647 carloads, while U.S. intermodal units slipped 7.9% to 261,602 intermodal units. U.S. rail carloads have been trending lower in 2019 compared with 2018. Source: SONAR Surf Rail volumes historically experience an uptick in the second half of the year because of peak season, which typically runs from between July and August to about October and November. During this time frame, freight volumes and freight rates can increase because of higher demand to move freight. This can come from the retail sector trying to secure goods ahead of the holiday season to grain producers needing to ship grain volumes to their domestic and international destinations. However, in 2019, rail executives said at recent conferences sponsored by investment firms that the rail industry's fall peak was either nonexistent or likened to the size of a speed bump versus a peak. We're in the peak season and there's not a peak, so I guess it will be softer than muted, a speed bump kind of thing, said CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) CEO Jim Foote at a conference sponsored by investment firm Stephens on Nov. 13 in Nashville, Tennessee. The cited causes for the lack of a peak season were similar to the reasons given for lower rail volumes this year. A weaker industrial economy, trade uncertainty between the U.S. and China and some trade restrictions levied by China for Canadian goods and a competitive truck market were some of the factors that executives gave for this year's muted peak season. People are not investing in that inventory build, said Alan Shaw, chief marketing officer for Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), at the Stephens conference on Nov. 14. Mike Upchurch, chief financial officer for Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), said the trade uncertainty is causing business to put projects on hold and that hesitation to invest is weighing on the industrial economy. I think you're going to need some resolution on trade before you see the industrial economy growing again, Upchurch said at the Stephens conference on Nov. 13. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-11-25,Freight Rail Seeks Ways To Stay Afloat Amid Sinking Rail Volumes,"As the freight rail industry looks ahead to 2020, the leaders of several Class I railroads and railroad lessors said a return to volume growth isn't likely to appear until the second half of next year. While the consumer economy appears to be stable amid factors such as low unemployment rates in the U.S., the industrial economy hasn't shown the same magnitude of strength, rail executives said at transportation conferences held by investment firms throughout November. I think our assumption is that it [the freight market] gets better. It may not get better just flipping the calendar to 2020. It may be more of a back half [of 2020] in terms of as the year progresses, that it improves through the year, but we do look for it to get better next year, said incoming Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Hamann at a conference sponsored by investment firm Stephens on Nov. 15. Janet Drysdale, vice president of financial planning at Canadian National (NYSE:CNI), echoed Hamann's sentiments at that same event on Nov. 13. We're expecting a soft landing in 2020 and not a recession, Drysdale said. To cope with potentially lower volumes in the first half of 2020, executives laid out several short-term initiatives, although they deferred any comments about 2020 guidance to when they announce their fourth-quarter results in January. Those initiatives include growing merchandise volumes, which is the bulk of the volumes that the Class I railroads carry. Opportunities to haul more plastics, grain and refined products are some areas where the railroads are seeking to increase their business, while domestic coal volumes appear likely to continue to decline. And although the rail prices can be about 10% to 15% cheaper compared with truck for hauling merchandise volumes, the railroads need to improve their service product to gain more business, according to CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) CEO Jim Foote at the Baird Industrial Conference on Nov. 6. CSX will get merchandise business when our service is reliable enough, Foote said. To boost its merchandise network, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) said it is trying to develop a more homogenous railcar strategy by limiting the car types it utilizes. Doing so improves asset utilization and makes better use of returning empty railcars, according to chief marketing officer Alan Shaw. Layer that strategy with technology to provide more visibility and transparency to the shipper, and that's when it becomes truck-like, Shaw said, referring to the competition that the railroads have with the trucking industry over freight volumes. Intermodal volumes, in contrast, can face more competition from trucking because intermodal moves typically involve trucks at some point when they travel along the supply chain. But the railroads said they are continuing to eye opportunities there so long as they can improve on their service product. Domestic intermodal volumes are vastly under-penetrated by rails and certainly by Union Pacific, Hamann said. Yet despite the competition from trucks, the railroads may be hesitant to lower their pricing to attract more businesses. We've seen several of these cycles play out over the years. I think we're better off holding on the pricing and letting the trucking market fight over the remaining freight with prices, Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Chief Financial Officer Mike Upchurch said at the Stephens conference on Nov. 13. Rail Lessors Eye Better Asset Utilization Rail lessors and rail equipment manufacturers are watching how the broader economy and the Class I railroads are responding to railcar demand and responding in turn. In the areas where we see the greatest amount of weakness, mostly in our general freight, we'll be reducing capacity, and we'll be a little more responsive to how the market is moving at this point, said Justin Roberts, vice president of corporate development for Greenbrier (NYSE:GBX). The problem with the lack of a trade agreement between the U.S. and China is that investors hesitate to purchase new railcars until there's some resolution, Roberts said. GATX (NYSE:GATX) CEO Brian Kenney said GATX is trying to use volatility to our advantage by tweaking the company's commercial strategy depending on the railcar. If there's demand for a railcar type, the company will raise lease rates and extend leasing terms. But if demand is sluggish, then GATX will drop rates to maintain asset utilization while also shortening leasing terms so as not to lock in those rates for too long, he said. This strategy, if executed successfully, results in more cars coming up for renewal in strong markets and a lot less in weak markets, Kenney said at the Baird conference on Nov. 6.

2019-11-26,Class I Rail Employment Hits New Low,"Employee headcount levels for the U.S. rail operations of Class I railroads hit a new low in October amid a slump in U.S. rail traffic and the transition to precision scheduled railroading (PSR). The total number of employees working for Class I railroads in the U.S. was 134,582 last month, which is the fewest for 2019, according to data collected by the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. That is 9.5% lower than October 2018 and nearly 1.7% down from September of this year. Of that total, October staffing levels for train and engine crews fell to 55,361, an 11.8% drop from October 2018 and a nearly 3.1% decline from September 2019. Train and engine crew headcount levels can be an indicator of rail demand, with levels rising and falling depending on network capacity needs. October's decline in overall U.S. Class I rail employment levels was the largest year-over-year decline in over three years, according to transportation analyst Bascome Majors of investment firm Susquehanna Financial Group. Train and engine crew totals also saw their biggest year-over-year decline in over three years, Majors said in a Nov. 20 research note. October's totals come as the railroads have furloughed workers amid declining rail volumes and the transition to PSR, an operating model that seeks to streamline rail operations and cut costs. Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) announced earlier this month that it was trimming staff amid lower rail volumes, while Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) have made similar moves in recent weeks as they transition to PSR.Year-to-date rail volumes, meanwhile, were down 4.5% in the U.S. to 23.8 million carloads and intermodal units for the week ending Nov. 16, the Association of American Railroads reported last week.

2019-11-27,Operations At Canadian National Resume,"Operations at Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) are returning to normal days after the railway and the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) announced a tentative end to an eight-day strike. TCRC said operations resumed at 6:00 a.m. local time across Canada on Nov. 27. Canadian National (CN) conductors, transpersons and yard workers went on strike on Nov. 19. The strike has hit supply chains across Canada, bringing trade disruptions, goods shortages and layoffs. The terms of the deal between CN and TCRC have not been disclosed, but TCRC said the agreement would need to be ratified by Teamsters members via secret-ballot electronic voting. Union meetings will be held across the country to explain the terms of the agreement to members in a process that will likely take several months, the union said. Ending the strike sent ripple effects across the supply chain. For instance, 70 members of the union Unifor had received notice at Autoport in Halifax that they had received layoff notices, but those notices have been rescinded, according to Unifor. Shippers said their operations were also affected by the strike. The Mining Association of Canada said the strike was deeply felt by the sector. The association stated on a Nov. 26, The impacts felt by the week-long strike resulted in costly disruptions for Canadian mining companies, many of whom incurred significant impacts over the last seven days, including lost sales and customers…These impacts will continue to be felt for the foreseeable future as it takes approximately a week to move the backlog created per day of disrupted service. The mining industry accounted for 52.3% of rail freight revenues generated in 2018, the association said. Saskatchewan-based fertilizer producer Nutrien said it would be shutting down its largest potash mine for two weeks starting Dec. 2 because of the rail strike. Even though the strike has ended, Nutrien still plans to shut down the mine, according to the Financial Post. It is extremely disappointing that in a year when the agricultural sector has been severely impacted by poor weather and trade disputes, the CN strike will add further hardship to the Canadian agriculture industry, said Nutrien CEO Chuck Magro. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) said interchange traffic moving through Rouses Point, New York has resumed. Customers should expect some delays until service returns to schedule, Norfolk Southern said in a Nov. 27 operations note. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-12-03,Norfolk Southern Makes Changes To Demurrage And Accessorial Charges,"Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) is making changes to its tariffs governing demurrage and accessorial charges, the railroad said on Dec. 1 in an operations update. The tariff changes are available here. Norfolk Southern (NS) is implementing a new tiered demurrage and storage structure to address cars that are held for seven days or longer, NS said. But demurrage rates will remain unchanged for cars that are held between one to six days, the railroad said. The changes will become effective on April 1, 2020 so that customers can review the changes, ask questions and assess the impact these changes may have on their operations. NS also said it has made tariff changes on accessorial charges, effective January 1, 2020. One pertains to overloaded cars that are delivered to their destination without being stopped en route for partial unloading. Another narrows the timeframe that customers have to file a claim with NS from three years to one year. As a leader in the transportation industry, we continually strive to provide the best service possible at all our customer locations on a consistent basis. When proper forwarding instructions are not provided at time of release, it results in additional time and expense to switch out that railcar, said Ed Elkins, vice president of industrial products for NS, in a letter addressing the changes. Going forward, NS reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to not pull a railcar that has been released without forwarding instructions and any railcars behind it. Beginning January 1, 2020, a new pull code will be activated that will require forwarding instructions be in place before a car can be released, the letter said. The changes come as NS and other Class I railroads have modified their demurrage and accessorial charges as they implement precision scheduled railroading, an operational model that seeks to streamline rail operations and trim costs. The railroads have said that the changes in the fees are to encourage customers not to hold onto railcars for longer than needed. But many shippers have pushed back against the changes, saying that the changes penalize shippers even when it's the railroads' fault for the held cars. The Surface Transportation Board, responding to shippers' requests, held a two-day hearing on demurrage and accessorial charges in May, and it proposed several initiatives in November aimed at addressing shippers' concerns. The STB has since received additional comments from both the railroads and shippers on the changes to demurrage and accessorial charges. Image by Michael Gaida from Pixabay"
2019-12-03,Introducing FreightWaves Passport Research,"FreightWaves is constantly innovating – exploring new data sets, posting new articles, and building new products and services for our audience. We wanted to find a way to do even more for our highly engaged community members, so we created FreightWaves Passport, a platform that delivers continuing education, proprietary research, discounted event tickets, and access to our market experts. FreightWaves SONAR already houses a rapidly growing research library of mostly long-form white papers covering industry topics like freight broker compensation, digital freight brokerage valuation, pricing power indexes, the performance of publicly traded transportation companies, and the cause of trucking carrier bankruptcies. All of that of research will be made available to Passport members. Empirical research has always been the missing link in transportation and logistics, said Kevin Hill, director of research at FreightWaves. Industry knowledge has traditionally been gained through experience and passed on by word-of-mouth. While this isn't necessarily bad, information passed on in that way is rarely tested against new market dynamics. That's where our research becomes extremely valuable; we collect market information daily and test it against industry tradition to see what still works and what does not. In addition, we've built a new team to launch even more research products – weekly reports on trucking, intermodal and ocean freight markets, as well as special topics of timely interest. These reports are generated by the Passport team, who treat these modes as true marketplaces and cover rates, volume (demand), and capacity (supply) on a weekly basis. SONAR data, supplemented with industry and government releases, provides the quantitative backbone of Passport research, but we also weave in qualitative commentary based on industry channel checks and headline analysis. FreightWaves research teams leverage the full capabilities of SONAR 5.0 to help our clients understand the near-time complexities of freight markets. The mapping functions in the latest version of the SONAR platform are especially robust, and we've already used them to visualize trucking market volatility and regions impacted by the U.S. industrial recession. (Map: FreightWaves SONAR) The map above displays trucking freight market data in two dimensions: color and height. Darker blue shades represent higher tender rejection rates or tighter trucking capacity, while the height of the market is determined by its outbound tender market share, or the relative size of the freight market. Displaying the data in this way allows SONAR and Passport members to quickly find important freight markets that may present opportunities for transportation companies. In addition to the new mapping functions, the Passport research team uses SONAR's new trucking rate predictor to calculate near-time spot rates for the most important trucking lanes in the United States. (Map: FreightWaves SONAR) The map above is from our first Special Topics report, Mapping the Industrial Recession, and displays timber mills (red) and paper mills (purple) on Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) railroad network. According to U.S. government industrial production data for October, paper as a nondurable material (instead of a consumer product) was down 4.9% year-over-year. According to railroad industry data, forest products volumes are down 5.3% year-to-date, and when FreightWaves released the report on November 22, Norfolk Southern's forest products were down more than 11% over the previous four weeks, the most of any Class I railroad. The FreightWaves Passport research team created maps displaying the regional impact of the industrial recession, including Norfolk Southern's exposure to forest products as well as, for example, the chemical plants on Union Pacific's network. The goal was to help our clients understand exactly which industries and geographies are leading the contraction in industrial production and which transportation companies are most likely to be affected. As we continue to build out our new research products, the team will publish insights on freightwaves.com, and discuss our findings on podcasts, webinars and at FreightWaves events.

2019-12-04,"Norfolk Southern Wants Track Changes, Residents Don't","FreightWaves occasionally posts high-quality content from partner publications in the freight industry. Visit Railway Age for more great content like this. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) wants to double-stack its trains as they move through Pittsburgh, but residents in the north side of the city are stacking up arguments and fighting back. A mediator has been appointed to represent the residents in Pittsburgh's north side as talks continue with Norfolk Southern (NS). The Class I railroad wants to raise bridges at Pennsylvania and West North avenues, lower the tracks at Columbus Avenue Bridge and build a new Merchant Street Bridge. The track is lower in spots along the route through the city, but NS says it cannot go any deeper in some areas. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) gave NS a $20 million grant for the work on the bridges. NS will be contributing $8.2 million. Rail traffic also would increase in the area, from about 25 trains a day to as many as 50. Residents are concerned about the noise pollution that accommodates more trains and more freight cars. A group tried to sway the Public Utility Commission's consideration of the proposed bridges, but the PUC did not side with the group's concerns. The mediator representing the citizens of Pittsburgh's north side says he wants to work with the railroad to come up with a solution both sides will agree on. PennDOT released a report that failed to recommend the best way to handle double-stacked rail freight, so the agency currently is meeting with community groups to take in all concerns. The study did say if the railroad cannot use the grant to fix the bridge, the responsibility would fall on the city. The project is already in motion in the Pittsburgh suburbs, but no work has begun in the city since the grant was awarded in April 2017. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2019-12-13,"Railroads, Shippers Grapple Over Revenue Adequacy","Will recommended changes to how the Surface Transportation Board (STB) tracks revenue adequacy end up serving as a revenue cap for Class I railroads? The railroads said yes but the shippers said no on the first day of a two-day hearing sponsored by the board on the topic. Shippers say offering alternative economic models that calculate revenue adequacy could make rail rate challenges more accessible for captive shippers that don't have an alternative viable rail option. The American Chemistry Council's (ACC) alternative model, called the benchmark method, will improve access to the rate relief process and substantially reduce burdens on shippers, railroads and the board, said Jeff Sloan, ACC's senior director of regulatory and technical affairs. But the railroads say changing existing practices with alternatives could be indirectly regulating a railroad's earnings. The recommended rate increase constraint (RIC) would have unintended consequences and might well be transformed over time into utility-style earnings regulation, said Joseph P. Kalt, Ford Foundation professor emeritus of international political economy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, in presentation notes to the board. Kalt was representing the Association of American Railroads (AAR). Discussing Revenue Adequacy The point behind the two-day hearing on Dec. 12 and 13 was to get feedback from shippers and the rail industry on the April recommendations from the board's Rate Reform Task Force (RRTF) on whether to change these economic models and calculations that STB uses to determine revenue adequacy. Congress tasked the board with determining annually whether a Class I railroad's revenue is adequate. Congress wants to ensure that the Class I railroads, which don't receive federal funding for capital projects, earn sufficient profit to foot the costs of maintaining and investing in their rail networks. A railroad reaches revenue adequacy when it achieves a rate of return on net investment that is equal to at least the current cost of capital for the railroad industry in the prior year, according to STB. Calculating revenue adequacy is important because the determination can inform STB's decision-making process during certain proceedings, such as those contesting rail rates and particularly in situations in which a captive shipper is involved. According to its Sept. 12 decision in the proceeding Ex Parte 722, STB wanted written and oral feedback on the following: Defining long-term revenue adequacy: The task force recommended defining this by looking at the annual determinations over the shortest period of time, not less than five years, that includes both a year in which a recession began and a year that follows a year when a recession began. Applying a rate increase constraint: The rate increase constraint would apply to long-term revenue adequate carriers and it would seek to identify a point beyond which further application of differential pricing would be unwarranted. Suspending bottleneck provisions: The task force recommended that STB consider suspending the bottleneck provisions applied to long-term revenue adequate carriers. Modifying the simplified stand-alone cost (SAC) standard: The RRTF suggested reinstating the simplification of the Road Property Investment analysis to help determine whether a long-term revenue adequate carrier's rate is reasonable. Shippers And Railroads Draw Their Lines The board initially scheduled the hearing on revenue adequacy for one day, but it added a day after multiple stakeholders sought to provide oral testimony. Shippers groups and shippers scheduled to speak the first day included the ACC, the National Coal Transportation Association, the Western Coal Traffic League, Auriga Polymers, Olin Corp. (NYSE:OLN), the Freight Rail Customer Alliance and PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF). The Montana Wheat and Barley Committee respectfully requests that the board continue to give due consideration to those shippers, like the Montana farmer [who is] removed from nearly all aspects of the railroad's operations but [is] entirely dependent upon it for [his or her] livelihood, said Zachary T. Coccoli, a representative for the Montana Wheat and Barley Committee and deputy legal counsel for the Montana Department of Agriculture. He continued, The ongoing efforts for the STB to learn from history, engage openly with stakeholders with objective and analytical decision-making, informed by accurate information, instills a renewed level of confidence in the outcome of the board's rate reform efforts. The railroads scheduled to speak included representatives from AAR, BNSF (NYSE:BRK), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) and Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP). The STB should refrain from adopting regulations that penalize a railroad for being successful in competitive markets without regard for what has driven its return levels, said Jill K. Mulligan, BNSF's vice president and general counsel, in her presentation. Both shippers and the railroads filed extensive written comments on revenue adequacy, and those comments are available online by searching for EP 722. But the first day of the hearing, as well as the days leading up to the hearing, served as an opportunity for both railroads and shippers to draw their lines. The ACC offered the benchmark method, an alternative economic model to STB's stand-alone cost standard, which the group said would use real-world data to predict a rate that would be expected in a competitive market and could evaluate how much captive rates should be allowed to exceed competitive rates while taking into account criteria such as a railroad's financial performance. Adopting rate benchmarking would be a win-win option for business and taxpayers because it would provide a more streamlined, rational approach for dealing with rate issues that would no longer require shippers, railroads and the federal government to sink millions of dollars into rate cases, ACC said. The Western Coal Traffic League agreed with some recommendations of STB's rate reform task force, but had serious concerns about other recommendations, such as how to determine the time parameters for long-term revenue adequacy. In lieu of the RRTF's recommendation to use study periods of varying lengths depending on the timing of economic recessions, the board should adopt a rolling five-year period for application of the presumption, the Western Coal Traffic League said in written testimony. Meanwhile, the railroads said that following through with the task force's recommendations could result in unintended consequences, such as curtailing capital investments. Artificial caps on rates or other regulatory devices meant to drive rates below market levels, as recommended by the RRTF on long-term revenue-adequate carriers, compromise the ability of rail carriers to make investments to maintain and expand their network and facilities and remain competitive in the dynamic transportation markets we compete in to meet customer growth and secure market share, BNSF said in written testimony. The railroads also said STB's efforts to revise revenue adequacy could result in rolling back some of the deregulation that occurred in the U.S. rail industry following the Staggers Act of 1980. Congress gave the agency no authority to impose an earnings constraint, revoke bottleneck protections and long-haul rights or resurrect Nixon-era price freezes simply because a carrier has achieved revenue adequacy, however defined, said Raymond A. Atkins, a partner at law firm Sidley Austin, in written testimony on behalf of AAR. Congress plainly did not intend the prize for carrier innovation, improved efficiency and creation of new competitive markets to be a return to overbearing federal regulatory control.

2019-12-17,Pennsylvania Provides More Than $40 Million For Freight Rail Projects,"The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PENNDOT) is awarding more than $40 million in funding towards 26 freight rail improvement projects throughout the state. While the majority of the grants are under $2 million to support network repairs and track and bridge rehabilitation, $14.4 million will be given to CSX (NYSE:CSX) to lower tracks under nine overhead obstructions so that CSX will be able to route double-stack container and multi-level auto rack traffic to and from the Port of Philadelphia. CSX's project will take place in Delaware and Philadelphia Counties. The full list of funded projects is available here. There are 65 operating railroads in Pennsylvania, which is more than any other state in the country, according to PENNDOT. The agency offers freight rail assistance grants annually. In 2018, it awarded $23 million for 27 rail projects. Investing in our extensive rail freight system increases mobility options and improves the efficiency of freight travel, said Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D). These investments underscore our continued commitment to building a world-class infrastructure system that supports the business community and the creation of new jobs. According to the Port of Philadelphia, both CSX and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) operate trains through the port. Norfolk Southern already provides double-stacking intermodal service at the port. CSX appreciates Governor Wolf and the Pennsylvania DOT for their leadership and commitment to investing in transportation infrastructure improvements to advance economic and job growth. This grant allows CSX to lower tracks in nine key areas that will increase capacity and improve service between Philadelphia to Midwest and Southeast markets for both domestic and international intermodal, and automotive traffic, CSX said. The project will provide benefits for dimensional cargo shipments, such as turbines and machinery. Pennsylvania stakeholders will also benefit from improved logistics systems along with the inherent environmental benefits of moving more freight by rail in lieu of trucks. Design and permitting is expected to continue through most of 2020 with the construction anticipated in 2021, the railroad said. Image by David Mark from Pixabay"
2019-12-31,2019 Rocks The Railroads,"A slump in North American rail volumes, record Canadian grain rail shipments and an active Surface Transportation Board were just some of the prominent themes in 2019. Here's a list — far from exhaustive — of some of the key issues that faced the rail industry this year. Lower Rail Volumes In North America Perhaps the most visible theme in 2019 was the weekly year-over-year decline in rail volumes, which resulted in the readjusting of earnings guidance by some of the Class I railroads. In the first half of the year, severe floods stymied Midwest freight rail operations, with Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), BNSF (NYSE:BRK), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) and even Eastern U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) needing to reroute service and/or repair damaged sections of track in states such as Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri. But as the year progressed, rail volumes continued to trend lower as a result of a variety of factors, which deserve their own heading: Trade uncertainty: Strained trade relations between the U.S. and China, in which each country slapped tariffs on the other country's goods (soybeans, consumer goods, etc.), contributed to weakening the U.S. industrial economy because investors were hesitant to proceed with projects until they had more clarity on the direction of the U.S. economy. Also uncertain in 2019 was whether the U.S., Canada and Mexico would ratify a trade agreement that would replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). U.S., Canadian and Mexican leaders are poised to sign NAFTA's replacement, known as USMCA, but when it will be fully signed and ratified remains to be seen. The heads of the freight rail associations of the respective countries have pressed their federal leadership to pass USMCA soon. Loose truck capacity: A competitive truck market ate away at some of the intermodal volumes for U.S. freight rail, particularly as shippers continued to raise concerns that rail service still needs to get better (see below). Intermodal volumes may have also been hit by a shift to utilizing the East Coast ports more over the West Coast, according to FreightWaves' Market Expert Mike Baudendistel. Three-quarters of the U.S. population live within 500 miles of the East Coast. That's a one-day truck move and a length of haul in which intermodal struggles to compete, he said. The question of whether intermodal will resume as a growth area depends on the rails' behavior, the railroad marketplace and railroad regulations, Baudendistel said. Will the rails reach a point at which their operating ratios flatten out, necessitating a growth avenue? Or will regulators and a relatively uncompetitive market continue to allow railroads' operating ratios to march ever lower, making intermodal volume growth an afterthought? An Active Surface Transportation Board The addition of two board members to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) this year has brought about a renewed interest to review longstanding rail rate-related issues, such as revenue adequacy and whether some commodities should remain exempt from being regulated by the board. The board is considering many of the suggestions listed in an April report by its Rate Reform Task Force, some of which are considered to be shipper friendly because they aim to make the process to contest rail rates easier. The board recently held a two-day hearing (Day 1 coverage and Day 2 coverage) on revenue adequacy. Board members also held a hearing in May on demurrage and accessorial charges (Day 1 coverage and Day 2 coverage). Some of the Class I railroads have modified their policies governing the charges as a way to incentivize shippers to return railcars faster. The railroads modified their policies as they took steps to further integrate precision scheduled railroading (PSR, see below) into their operating models. PSR seeks to streamline rail operations by running trains on a fixed schedule. But some shippers have argued that they are being penalized unfairly for delays that were caused by the railroads. The tenor of the debates between the railroads and shippers has caused some to question whether the relationship has broken down and needs to be repaired. Operational Ratios Reach Record Lows With all the Class I railroads except BNSF deploying PSR, the railroads have cut costs and looked at how best to utilize their assets from a PSR standpoint. The result has been record low quarterly operating ratios (OR) even in spite of lower rail volumes. A falling OR, which is often calculated by dividing operating expenses by revenues, can indicate a company's increasing profitability to investors. Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern (NS) and Kansas City Southern implemented or completed the first phases of their versions of PSR in 2019, while executives from CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and the Canadian railroads reminded investors in quarterly earnings calls that they have employed PSR for several years running. We believe we'll see the fruits of our efforts in the form of a resumption of growth. … But if we don't, we'll push even harder on efficiency measures [and] on productivity measures to get to the 60[%] OR, said NS CEO Jim Squires during the company's third-quarter earnings call on Oct. 23. Canadian Grain Shipments Reach Record Highs Although U.S. grail volumes via rail slumped amid severe floods in the Midwest and Chinese tariffs on grain products such as soybeans, Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) and Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) hauled record-high grain volumes for the agricultural year running from Aug. 1, 2018, to July 31, 2019. CP and Canadian National (CN) were able to move so much grain and grain products in part because of incentives in the Transportation Modernization Act of 2018 that encouraged the railways to invest in capital infrastructure and rail equipment. That, coupled with private investments by grain stakeholders, enabled the railways to support more export-bound grain movements. Strike At Canadian National And Labor Relations The eight-day strike at CN in November by members of the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference sent ripples across the Canadian supply chain. Trade associations representing chemical, grain and mining interests said the strike disrupted operations, while the union Unifor confirmed that its members received layoff notices as a result of the strike. Those notices were later rescinded. Meanwhile, CN said the strike would trim about C$0.15/share from fourth-quarter profits. As CN and the Teamsters working toward ratifying their agreement over the next several months, the rail unions and the U.S. operations of the freight railroads started a new collective bargaining round in November. That process will likely continue through 2020. Mergers And Acquisitions Within The Short Line Industry This year saw a number of mergers and acquisitions (M&As) within the short line industry. Among the most notable was the acquisition of Genesee & Wyoming by Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE:BIP) and GIC in a deal worth $8.4 billion. But other M&As occurred throughout the year, including acquisitions by short line operator OmniTRAX. Experts anticipate that more M&A activity might occur in 2020 as private equity firms continue to see infrastructure as a viable long-term investment. Infrastructure is hot, firms have resources to chase these deals and these are assets that they think fit well into their investment profile, said Bill Kucera, a partner at law firm Mayer Brown in Chicago. Kucera represents companies involved in short line M&As. Meanwhile, the short line industry applauded congressional efforts to pass legislation that would modify the U.S. tax code so that short lines can receive a tax credit for investing in their infrastructure. President Donald Trump signed into law on Dec. 20 the bill H.R. 1865, which extends that tax credit through 2022. Extending the tax credit would be a tremendous victory for the thousands of agricultural, energy, industrial and manufacturing shippers that rely on short line railroad service every day to connect them to the domestic and global economies, said Chuck Baker, president of the American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association, prior to Trump signing H.R. 1865 into law.

2020-01-08,Railroads Want Price-Fixing Lawsuits At One Venue,"The Class I railroads that have been named in numerous lawsuits alleging price fixing are seeking to move those lawsuits to one court, according to a recent court filing. BNSF (NYSE:BRK), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP), CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) are asking to transfer rail freight fuel surcharge antitrust litigation to one of two court locations, according to a Dec. 19 court filing for MDL No. 2925 [MDL stands for multi-district legislation]. The U.S. Judicial Panel on MDL will hold a hearing Jan. 30 in Tampa, Florida, that addresses this request. The railroads want the lawsuits transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The lawsuits currently are filed at 16 different U.S. district courts throughout the nation. Another option is to transfer the litigation to MDL. No. 1869, which was held at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and is part of a longstanding proceeding on whether shippers have the ability to form a class action lawsuit against the Class I railroads on fuel surcharge price fixing. The U.S. District Appeals Court ruled in August that shippers would have to file individual lawsuits instead of a class action lawsuit, and shippers subsequently filed dozens of lawsuits in September and October. Shippers' lawsuits allege that between 2003 and 2008 the railroads engaged in price fixing by assessing fuel surcharges and saying they were part of a fuel cost recovery program, thus violating the Sherman Act. While the bulk of shippers' lawsuits were filed in the fall, additional companies have filed similar suits in recent weeks. In December, Total Petrochemicals and Refining joined a list of more than three dozen companies and shipping groups alleging price fixing, while International Paper filed its suit Monday.

2020-01-20,JB Hunt's Earnings Call Highlights Headwinds In Brokerage And Intermodal,"J.B. Hunt Transport Services' (NASDAQ:JBHT) fourth quarter 2019 earnings miss, about 10% according to most consensus estimate providers, was partly due to its continued investment in Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360. The digital load-matching platform connects carriers and shippers. From the outset, management said that they expected cost headwinds from the roughly $500 million investment in the platform — including scaling the platform, personnel and technology — to weigh on results for four to six quarters. J.B. Hunt released its shipper portal on the platform, Shipper 360 by J.B. Hunt, in November. Spot-Market Fundamentals Were A Drag On ICS The earnings drag from the investment was noticeable in the company's brokerage business, Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), which reported an $11.8 million loss in the quarter. ICS revenue increased 9% year-over-year, with loads up 3% and revenue per load 6% higher. However, gross margins in the business eroded 630 basis points to 10.6% as costs from expanding the digital platform were a headwind. It wasn't just the investment that presented a headwind. ICS Key Performance Indicators Management said that the margin compression, which accelerated through the quarter, was driven by the supply side with the company's available number of carriers declining in December and thus far in January. Management noted that truck capacity began to tighten the week prior to Thanksgiving, accelerating in December, and only modestly loosening so far in January. Further, management believes that the condensed holiday season, roughly one week shorter in 2019 versus 2018 due to a later Thanksgiving, resulted in very tight capacity in the back half of the quarter; 65% of ICS revenue was contractual in 2019 versus 53% in the fourth quarter of 2018. That means that the company was buying truck capacity at presumably a higher rate than that provided by its previously negotiated contractual rates. Further, J.B. Hunt was growing market share in the face of tighter capacity for at least part of the quarter. The commentary on capacity tightness lines up with the increases seen in the number of loads rejected by carriers. Load rejections spiked as high as 153% year-over-year during the 2019 holiday spending season and still remain 37% higher than the year-ago period. Outbound Tender Reject and Outbound Tender Volume Indexes – SONAR: OTRI.USA, OTVI.USA No Formal Guidance On Intermodal Yet Management didn't provide any definitive guidance around intermodal expectations in 2020. They noted that the first quarter of 2020 has a bit of a tailwind as some 60,000 to 70,000 loads on an annualized basis were lost in the first quarter of 2019 due to lane closures by the railroads. The only intermodal volume guidance provided by management was that they expect volumes to increase in 2020. During fourth quarter 2019, J.B. Hunt reported a 1.6% year-over-year increase in intermodal loads, likely much better than the industry. On average, the U.S. Class I railroads reported a 6.6% year-over-year decline in container volumes, with J.B. Hunt's primary rail partners Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) reporting a 6.4% decline and BNSF Railway (NYSE:BRK) reporting a 2.3% decline in container traffic during the quarter. While J.B. Hunt appears to have taken market share in the period, yields were modestly lower as revenue per load declined 1.2% year-over-year even though average length of haul increased 2.8%. Intermodal Key Performance Indicators No guidance was provided on intermodal pricing other than to acknowledge that there were some headwinds facing pricing. Management said that it's too early to make a call on intermodal pricing for 2020, noting a difficult capacity market and that there's pressure out there. However, they said that if rail purchased transportation costs increase, they would expect to be able to raise rates by at least a commensurate amount. Longer-term intermodal fundamentals appear to remain in place. The company sees roughly 8 million to 10 million loads currently being moved by truck that are likely eligible to convert to rail. The key will be whether the railroads can provide an improved service offering on a consistent basis or not. Through precision scheduled railroading (PSR) the rails have seen significant improvement in their service offerings. However, some in the industry believe that this has as much to do with mid- to high single-digit volume declines as it does with PSR initiatives. Management believes that continued volume growth is attainable and said that they are gaining traction with the midsized shipper market that is being introduced to intermodal through the 360 platform for the first time. Dedicated The Star Again The company's dedicated division continues to provide strength to their financial model. Revenue in the division increased 20% year-over-year as loads increased 17% and revenue per truck per week climbed 11% excluding fuel surcharges. Average dedicated trucks increased by more than 1,100 units and management said that they plan on adding another 800 to 1,000 trucks in 2020. The dedicated division benefited from a previous acquisition (Cory 1st Choice Home Delivery) in its final-mile offering and added scale with another final-mile acquisition (RDI Last Mile) earlier this month. With the rapid expansion of Final Mile Services, plans are to break out the unit's financials separately beginning in the first quarter. Management expects this division to continue to outpace the broader final-mile market in terms of growth as it is expected to be a billion-dollar business in the future, compared to a roughly more than $500 million annual run rate currently. Potential Suitor Of XPO's Last Mile Unit When asked if they would consider a very large final-mile acquisition, presumably a reference to XPO Logistics' (NYSE:XPO) announcement that it would explore divesting potentially all of its business units except for less-than-truckload, J.B. Hunt's CEO John Roberts said he hadn't thought about it until two days ago. However, he went on to say that the company would never say never and could lever up the balance sheet, borrowing the capital needed to acquire such an entity as long as the financial returns are met. Shares of JBHT were 4% lower on the day. JBHT Stock Price Chart – SONAR: STOCK.JBHT Image Sourced from Pixabay"

2020-01-29,Less Volume Drives Down Norfolk Southern Profit,"Railroad giant Norfolk Southern Corp.'s fourth-quarter profit declined 5% as the company hauled 9% less freight, officials said. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) reported its operating and financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019 before the market opened Wednesday. Norfolk Southern (NS) reported total revenues of $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter, down 7% year-over-year, and net income of $666 million for the quarter, a 5% decrease from a year ago. NS CEO James A. Squires told reporters during a conference call that volume deterioration throughout the year culminated in fourth-quarter and full-year volume declines of 9% and 5%, respectively. We remained focused on running our railroad as efficiently as possible and with a high level of customer service, achieving our locomotive and T&E [train and engine crew] workforce productivity goals, despite having less freight to haul. The railroad's earnings per share for the quarter were $2.55, topping Wall Street analysts' expectation for the quarter at $2.29 per share. Over the last four quarters, NS has surpassed consensus earnings-per-share estimates three times. Norfolk Southern 2019 Value 2018 Value Y/Y Gross Change Y/Y % Change Freight revenue (in millions) $2,690.0 $2,896.0 ($206.0) -7.1% Carloads (000s) 1,803 1,985 -182.60 -9.2% Revenue per carload $1,492 $1,458 $34.0 2.3% Intermodal shipments 1,028 1,119 -90.70 -8.1% Intermodal revenue per carload $678 $675 $3.0 0.4% Gross ton miles (in billions) 88.4 97.6 -9.20 -9.4% Revenue per tonmile (in billions) $45 $51 ($5.5) -10.8% Employee counts (average) 22478 26,638 -4,160.00 -15.6% Train velocity (mph) 23 19.3 3.70 19.2% Dwell time (hours) 18.3 25.9 -7.60 -29.3% OR% 64.2% 62.8% 1.40% 2.2% EPS $2.55 $2.57 ($0.0) -0.8% Macroeconomic headwinds challenged volume in 2019, particularly in the second half of the year, Alan Shaw, chief marketing officer, told investors. The weak manufacturing environment and low commodity prices drove down merchandise volumes in all groups — led by a 17% decline in steel, Shaw said. Import steel tariffs affected the traffic flows and lower steel prices reflected weak demand. The company also recorded a 21% decline in coal revenue during the fourth quarter and 7% decline in intermodal revenue. Shaw said revenues for utility coal were impacted by low natural gas prices, falling seaborne prices for coal and Chinese tariffs. Export thermal coal prices remained at low levels, making it difficult for us to compete globally, Shaw said. However, NS achieved an operating ratio (OR) of 64.2% for the quarter. But income from railway operations was $1 billion, a decrease of $116 million year-over-year. A drop in expenses wasn't enough to offset declines in freight revenue, including decreases in coal and intermodal revenue. Meanwhile, service metrics improved amid NS' precision scheduled railroading efforts. Average train speed jumped 19% to 23 miles per hour, while average terminal dwell dropped to 18.3 hours from 25.9 hours. Squires said one of the strategies for 2020 is getting shippers to use more rail instead of trucks. NS is the largest rail operator on the East Coast and third largest in the U.S. It operates about 19,500 miles of track in 22 states and the District of Columbia. The company has approximately 23,000 employees. We are targeting the truck market. That's the market-share opportunity, that's the big opportunity for us, Squires said, adding that the linchpin of our growth strategy is getting trucks off the road onto the railroad.

2020-01-30,US Class I Railroads Eye Intermodal Lane Opportunities,"With U.S. coal volumes facing a secular decline, U.S. Class I railroads are focused on making their intermodal and merchandise services competitive with the trucking market by revamping their strategy on interline lanes, judging from recent actions by the railroads. On Monday, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) told customers of its premium segment that it would open a number of domestic interline lanes originating on Union Pacific (UP) and destined for various points in the Eastern U.S. These lanes, which interchange with Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) will be activated on Saturday. UP's premium segment includes its intermodal service. Shipping finished vehicles and automotive parts is also part of UP's premium segment. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern (NS) said the opportunities to take market share away from trucks are not only in intermodal but also in merchandise. NS's merchandise segment includes commodities such as agricultural products, automotive parts, chemicals, construction materials and metals. We're working feverishly with our interline partners and with our customers to look at new lanes that offer value to our customers and offer value to our shareholders. So this is not static. It's a dynamic review of our overall franchise, finding areas where we can provide value, and we can support our channel partner's growth, Alan Shaw, NS's chief marketing officer, told investors during his company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Wednesday. The focus on interline lanes comes ahead of expectations that the trucking market could tighten in the second half of this year. The Class I's are looking to add truck-competitive volumes, especially as a potential [second half of 2020] trucking recovery and a large increase in trucking prices loom large, said Jason Seidl, transportation director for investment firm Cowen, in a research note on Wednesday. Both UP and NS said their decisions to open or seek lane opportunities are part of their wider efforts to deploy precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operating model that seeks to streamline operations. The newly open lanes to the Eastern U.S. are as a result of Union Pacific's Unified Plan 2020 [UP's version of PSR], and our objective of providing safe and reliable service products, UP said in its Monday note to customers. What's unique about Norfolk Southern is that as we implemented PSR, our service got better. And so we're in a great position to grow as we move forward. And if you think about truck and the opportunities there, it aligns perfectly with the unique strengths of our franchise, Shaw said. The railroads will need to keep up service levels this year if they want to compete against the trucking market, Seidl said. If NSC can keep improving its service levels with its precision scheduled railroading (PSR) implementation, it should be able to make its intermodal product more reliable. It is this increased reliability that will likely matter more for potential modal shifts back to the railroad, Seidl said. Meanwhile, CSX said during its fourth-quarter earnings call last week that it had completed the lane rationalizations it started in 2017, but it's looking to grow volumes on the lanes it has. We expect intermodal volumes to increase in 2020 as we have now fully lapped the lane rationalization impact and look to grow the reengineered network, CSX CEO Jim Foote said. The Class I railroads say the loose truck market of 2019 put pressure on rail. NS attributed an 8% year-over-year decline in intermodal revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 to excess truck capacity in a weak freight environment. UP cited similar conditions. International intermodal comparisons were also more challenging in the fourth quarter because of the pull-ahead of inventories due to the U.S.-China tariff dispute, NS said. The railroads have been seeking ways to make up for lost rail volumes that have resulted from declining U.S. coal production. Coal carloads represented nearly a third of total U.S. carloads in 2019, according to the Association of American Railroads, and U.S. coal production is expected to decline even further over the next several years amid low natural gas prices. Our eyes are on that $800 billion truck market. And that's where the growth opportunities are. And that's where we're going to see improvement as the year progresses… It requires fierce competition and putting new products out there, new logistics services that our customers value, Shaw said.

2020-02-04,Regional Rail To Acquire Carolina Coastal Railway,"Short line operator Regional Rail will be acquiring Carolina Coastal Railway, a 180-mile freight rail line located primarily in North Carolina. The acquisition, announced Monday by Regional Rail's parent company 3i, a U.K.-based private equity firm, is subject to approval by the Surface Transportation Board. Financial terms weren't disclosed. The short line provides freight rail and car storage services to over 45 customers, including aggregates, food and agriculture, chemicals, and metals. Carolina Coastal's North Carolina assets include a 142-mile line between Raleigh and Plymouth and a 17-mile line between Belhaven and Pinetown. It interchanges with Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) at Raleigh and Chocowinity and with CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) at Wilson and Greenville. It will be leasing a Norfolk Southern line in South Carolina, according to its website. The short line also has connections to a barge facility in Belhaven and provides switching services to the Port of Morehead City in North Carolina. The short line additionally has sites available for industrial development and transloading. Carolina Coastal is a great fit with Regional Rail as it benefits from an attractive mix of industrial customers and further diversifies our existing freight-rail platform from an end-market and geographic perspective, said Regional Rail CEO Al Sauer. We look forward to welcoming all of the Carolina Coastal employees to Regional Rail and working with them to continue the company's successful growth. After the acquisition, Regional Rail will operate 25 line segments across five states, with almost 550 miles of track, according to Rob Collins, managing partner for 3i's North American infrastructure division. 3i invested in Regional Rail in July 2019. Through the six short lines it currently owns, Regional Rail operates over 360 miles of track and has rail freight, railcar storage and transloading operations across New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Florida. Regional Rail moved over 29,000 carloads and served over 140 customers in 2018, according to 3i. Regional Rail also provides railroad crossing signal design, construction, inspection and maintenance services to over 100 short line and industrial customers across 20 states, 3i said. Carolina Coastal's acquisition is just one of several announced in recent months as the industry is still ripe for mergers and acquisitions, according to experts. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2020-02-10,"Weak Earnings Reported Across The Industry, But Investors Are Buying Into The Recovery Story","During earnings season, FreightWaves will be covering many companies across all modes, as well as shippers and retailers. Each week, we will recap the most interesting company earnings and any merger-and-acquisition activity from the preceding seven days. Take a look at the past week's finance recap: Earnings Logistics Echo Global Logistics (NASDAQ:ECHO) Echo beats on revenue and earnings in ‘challenging freight market' Echo Global Logistics reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 26 cents, beating the Street's estimate of 16 cents; Echo's revenue of $531.7 million beat estimates of $522 million. After a year of a weak spot market and contract prices de-rating, Echo managed to protect its net revenue margins, which compressed by only 70 basis points year-over-year to 16.9%. Still, gross revenue fell 8.8% compared with the fourth quarter of 2018, and net revenue dropped 12.4% year-over-year. Although gross revenue fell by double digits, sales, general and administrative expenses were cut by only 5.3%, so they consumed a larger portion of net revenues. Commission expense stayed fairly constant as a percentage of net revenue. Net income fell 79.7% to $1.4 million. Hub Group (NASDAQ:HUBG) Hub Group makes its numbers, sees a stronger year in 2020 Intermodal carrier Hub Group (NASDAQ:HUBG) posted fourth-quarter 2019 earnings in line with the consensus forecast of 82-85 cents per share, on a revenue decline of 11.5%. For the company as a whole, total revenue dropped to $900.68 million, from $1.018 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. Operating income was down to $27.95 million from $33.67 million, a drop of 19.5%.The drop in revenue and earnings did not prevent the company from actually increasing its gross margin as a percent of revenue to 14% from 13.6%. However, gross margin as a whole did not improve. It declined to $125.86 million, from $138.58 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. Less-than-truckload ArcBest Corp. (NASDAQ:ARCB) ArcBest's tough times extending into early 2020 The fourth quarter was the most challenging of 2019 for less-than-truckload (LTL) and logistics provider ArcBest Corp. The good news, at least relative to analysts' expectations, is that fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 56 cents came in well above consensus estimates of 44 cents per share. Operating income was $20.2 million, up from the $17.9 million consensus. Revenue was $717.4 million, slightly below consensus, as revenue for its LTL and asset-light units were lighter than in the 2018 period, a much better macro environment for providers. LTL operating ratio, the ratio of revenues and expenses, went the wrong way last quarter, rising to 96% from 93.3% in 2018. Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. (NASDAQ:ODFL) Weak industrial economy hurts Old Dominion's Q4 numbers; EPS beats estimates Old Dominion Freight Line Inc. reported across-the-board declines in its fourth-quarter financial and operating metrics, although its diluted earnings per share of $1.80 came in a bit above analysts' consensus estimates of $1.78. The weaker numbers were expected given the downturn in industrial production that has plagued the LTL industry's top line since the fourth quarter of 2018. Old Dominion executives highlighted the macro headwinds throughout most of 2019 and gave no indication as the year progressed that the near-term outlook would improve. For the quarter, revenue came in at $1.009 billion, down from nearly $1.027 billion in the 2018 quarter, and the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines. Operating income dropped by more than $30 million to $188.2 million. Operating expenses rose across virtually every line item, especially in labor costs and in the insurance and claims category, where costs almost doubled year-over-year. SAIA Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA) Saia fourth-quarter EPS comes in light; operating income falls nearly 18% SAIA Inc. (NASDAQ:SAIA) posted on Monday mixed fourth-quarter results, but analysts and investors chose to focus on more favorable news ahead for 2020, helping send shares up more than 8% by the close of trading. The Johns Creek, Georgia-based company posted a near 9% increase in fourth-quarter revenue, but operating income declined 17.7% due to the high costs of the company's U.S. expansion, increased labor costs, a rise in depreciation and amortization expenses, and a spike in insurance claims due to several severe accidents. For the year, revenue hit a record $1.8 billion, an 8% increase over 2018. Operating income was $152.6 million, an 8.1% increase. Daily volume rose 4.3%, but tonnage dipped 0.4%. Revenue per shipment rose 3.4%.

2020-02-14,Carriers And Shippers Call For Long-Term Infrastructure Funding,"U.S. lawmakers negotiating new surface transportation legislation will need to include a long-term infrastructure funding plan if they're going to satisfy the nation's truck, rail and ocean carriers, as well as the carriers' customers. That theme was prevalent throughout roughly 75 comments submitted to the U.S Department of Transportation (DOT) in response to the agency's request for information on a National Freight Strategic Plan. While DOT has acknowledged that investment in freight infrastructure must be considered in transportation initiatives, users of the infrastructure assert that not enough attention or money is coming from the federal government. Lagging investment in critical infrastructure and inadequacy of long-term funding solutions is one of the three most important challenges facing the U.S. freight transportation system, asserted the Consumer Brands Association (CBA) in comments filed in response to DOT's request. CBA represents the $2 trillion consumer packaged goods industry. Its members include some of the country's largest private truck fleet operators. Eliminating freight pinch-points would be an easy way to evaluate progress on the most strategically important national freight system goals, the group noted, and evaluating long-term success may require the development of new KPIs [Key Performance Indicators], as a way of capturing overall impact and contribution to the national freight system. There's no national vision or strategy that evaluates how individual investments impact the overall safety and reliability of the goods movement system, Elaine Nessle, executive director for the Coalition for America's Gateways and Trade Corridors (CAGTC), told FreightWaves. Even though states have plans that have focused state investments on intrastate commerce, we haven't taken that systemwide approach needed to make those investments across the entire supply chain. In comments filed with DOT, Nessle and CAGTC, whose members include the nation's largest container ports, called for minimum annual federal funding of $12 billion for a multimodal competitive grant program. The current multimodal grant program, Infrastructure for Rebuilding America, made available $900 million for 2020. The American Trucking Associations (ATA) agreed, noting only the federal government is in a position to look at investment decisions in the context of national impacts and determine which investments can produce the greatest economic benefits regardless of jurisdictional considerations. While ATA ranked a shortage of labor as the No. 1 challenge in the trucking industry, the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA), which represents small-business trucking companies, ranked underinvestment in highway infrastructure as the country's most important freight challenge. Owner-operators and independent drivers must foot the bill for repair costs caused by inadequate infrastructure, the group emphasized, citing an internal study finding that OOIDA members spend roughly $5,000 a year on repairs due to highway damage or poor road conditions. For owner-operators, these costs result in less income and less investment for maintenance, equipment, and other critical safety upgrades. Nucor Steel (NYSE:NUE), one of a handful of shippers providing comments, placed infrastructure at the top of its main challenge list. Significant additional spending on transportation infrastructure is critically needed including, but not limited to, highways, bridges, rural connectors, locks and dams, the company stated. Additionally, with the growth of trade associated with the new USMCA, the nodes where the infrastructure of the US, Canada, and Mexico come together will need to be addressed. Even railroads, which compete with trucking for certain types of freight and frequently point out that they rely on their own profits to pay for their networks, acknowledged that a long-term funding plan is needed. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), one of the four largest U.S.-based railroads, maintained that DOT should institute policies that ensure long‐term viable funding sources for public and private transportation infrastructure, including highways, and that ensure that the primary users are paying for that infrastructure in some manner.

2020-02-17,US Lawmakers Urged To Address Blocked Grade Crossings,"Congress should consider drafting legislation defining what role each stakeholder has to play in reducing blocked crossings, several witnesses at a recent U.S. House hearing said. With little federal oversight and no state authority, there are no tools to incentivize or deter railroads from blocking crossings. … We believe that federal legislation is necessary to bridge the gap between preempted state laws and the [Surface Transportation Board's] authority on blocked crossings, and to provide consistent direction instead of waiting for case-by-case issues to arise that create immediate negative impacts to public safety and convenience, said witness Brian Vercuysse, rail safety program administrator for the Illinois Commerce Commission. The purpose of the Feb. 5 hearing, conducted by the Democrat-led U.S. House Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials, was to see whether and how Washington should regulate the thousands of highway-rail grade crossings in the U.S. A federal law to identify problematic blocked crossings should define who should investigate the blocked crossings — whether state-certified inspectors or inspectors with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) — and lay out how to communicate information to the freight railroads, Vercuysse said. For locations where we've had continuous blockages and we haven't been able to come up with a successful solution, there should be a penalty structure similar to what we've seen in state statutes, Vercuysse said. In Vercuysse's written testimony, he outlined five safety concerns related to highway-rail grade crossings, including issues with conventional track circuits with a loss of shunt, blocked crossings and trespassing. The loss of shunt, a primary concern for Illinois, occurs when the crossing signal and warning device systems fail to properly detect approaching passenger trains. Illinois has been working with the railroads, Amtrak and FRA to address this issue, Vercuysse said. We believe there is a need to push towards and fund the next generation of positive train control that activates warning devices at highway-rail crossings and provides more functionality in train signaling, and that does not predominantly rely on conventional track circuits first used in the late 1800s, Vercuysse said. This will provide the additional safe method of train detection needed for those loss-of-shunt conditions that occur with light/fast commuter operations and freight train movements that are caused by rail contamination. Changes should also be made to existing federal regulations that govern the reporting of activation failures, so that the reporting occurs within 24 hours, which is consistent with reporting of accidents involving grade crossing signal failures, he said. As for longer trains and their role in blocking grade crossings, Vercuysse said the Illinois Commerce Commission reviewed 40 years of FRA data on freight train and vehicle collisions at mainline grade crossings, finding that the accident rate increased 10.4% for grade crossing incidents between 2010 and 2019 even though train accidents per million-train-miles fell 14% between 2008 and 2017. Karl Alexy, FRA's associate administrator for railroad safety and chief safety officer, also said all stakeholders need a role in addressing safety issues at grade crossings. Of the stakeholders — railroads, communities, individuals, and regulators — none can solve these issues on its own. We need all stakeholders to take action to prioritize, prevent, and address these issues, Alexy said in written testimony. Railroads need to be cognizant of how their operations affect the communities through which they operate. Local law enforcement officials need to prioritize, to the extent possible, enforcement of vehicle traffic signals at highway-rail grade crossings and trespassing laws, and strict prosecution of resulting citations. Alexy said the FRA in November 2019 developed and began to implement a highway-rail grade crossing safety business plan aimed at integrating technology at grade crossings to improve grade crossing safety. The agency is also working with the rail industry, state and local governments, and law enforcement on hot spot trespassing or accident-prone areas, he said. Jason Morris, assistant vice president for safety and the environment for Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), laid out eight ways the federal government can improve grade crossing safety, including maintaining or increasing funding for the federal Section 130 program, which funds grants to eliminate hazards at highway-rail grade crossings; incentivizing states to bundle grade crossing projects into a single grant application under existing federal capital improvement grants; and establishing federal policies that encourage or require the accelerated deployment of navigational warnings for motorists approaching grade crossings, among other suggestions.

2020-02-19,Norfolk Southern To Close Roanoke Distribution Facility,"Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) is closing a distribution center in Roanoke, Virginia, citing declining coal volumes and a leaner locomotive fleet. The company will be closing the Roanoke Distribution Center and plans to transfer the work of the center's locomotive shop to its Juniata Locomotive Shop in Altoona, Pennsylvania. About 85 shop mechanical employees will have the opportunity to transfer to Altoona, Norfolk Southern (NS) said on Feb. 18. Nineteen clerical positions will be eliminated, but the furloughed workers will have the opportunity to apply for available positions elsewhere. The Roanoke Distribution Center will continue to operate through April 18, while personnel will remain at the Roanoke Locomotive Shop through May 18. We maintain a long-standing affiliation with the Roanoke area and the many generations of highly talented men and women who have worked for NS in Roanoke, which makes today's announcement especially difficult, the company said in a release. It added that more than 650 people will still remain in Roanoke working for NS. NS explained its difficult but necessary decision as a way for the company to maintain the right mix of people and facilities in the right locations. NS noted that the coal tonnage that it ships has slipped by 48% since 2008, while its locomotive fleet has been reduced by 22% since late 2018. Because NS has reduced its locomotive fleet, there is also less volume for locomotive maintenance and repair. As a result, the company could no longer support two separate heavy-repair locomotive facilities. The closure comes as overall U.S. coal consumption has declined amid cheaper prices for natural gas, a competing fuel source for electricity generation. Meanwhile, lower natural gas prices in Europe are also putting pressure on the export coal market. Export thermal coal prices remained at low levels, making it difficult for us to compete globally, NS Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw said during his company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Jan. 29. NS had noted then that coal revenue fell 21% in the fourth quarter, with revenues for utility coal impacted by low natural gas prices, falling seaborne prices for coal and Chinese tariffs. Meanwhile, NS's efforts to deploy precision scheduled railroading, as well as lower U.S. rail volumes overall in 2019, have contributed to fewer locomotives needed for rail operations. The company's overall headcount level in mid-January totaled 21,840 employees, according to data received by the Surface Transportation Board. This is in contrast to the 26,282 people that NS employed in mid-January 2019. The decline in employee totals is reflective of an industry-wide drop in headcount totals. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2020-02-26,"Class I Rail Executives Talk Coronavirus, Truck Markets, Crude-By-Rail","The coronavirus outbreak, truck market competition and crude-by-rail in Canada were key topics for Class I rail executives at recent investor conferences. Here's a roundup: Uncertainty Over Impact Of Coronavirus Outbreak The Class I railroads, along with their customers, are taking a wait-and-see approach to how the coronavirus outbreak might affect the North American supply chain. The timing of the outbreak was such that many workers in China received an extended holiday following the Lunar New Year, or they worked remotely. But factories still have to ramp up manufacturing, and it's unclear when production will return to normal. How a production lull in China will affect North American railroads remains to be seen, executives said. I would not be surprised if we see another two, three, four weeks of ramp up before we … get to the point where we were four months ago, said Keith Reardon, senior vice president of the consumer product supply chain for Canadian National (NYSE:CNI). Not only do Chinese manufacturers need to ramp up production, they also need to get the country's supply chain from the plants to the ports back in order, Reardon said Thursday at a Barclays investor conference. Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) also said it's unclear what the coronavirus outbreak might mean for rail volumes, especially since the railway hasn't yet seen any significant shifts in supply chain activity. I think our customers are probably as puzzled as we are. I don't think there's an accurate answer because we just don't know yet, CP CEO Keith Creel said last Wednesday at the Barclays conference. We're paying attention obviously to [the] intermodal space, international intermodal, but with that being said, our business, because of a contract win with Yang Ming [Marine Transport Corp.] coming online, is still up double digits. So we look at blank sailings; we only know of one so far, but do we expect that more may come? I think that's a reasonable expectation. Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) CEO Pat Ottensmeyer echoed Creel's sentiments about not yet seeing significant changes in supply chain activity. I have not gotten any feedback from customers about plans to slow down. Obviously for us, I think the first place we would see it slow down is [at the Port of] Lázaro [Cárdenas in Mexico for] international intermodal [volumes] for auto [components] coming in, electronics, manufacturing, Ottensmeyer said at the Citi investor conference last Wednesday. You look at our Lázaro numbers for the first six weeks of the year. They're off the charts, although some of that is due to uneven year-over-year comparisons resulting from service problems last year, Ottensmeyer said. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) CFO Jennifer Hamann said one outcome from the coronavirus outbreak is that the second half of 2020 could still see stronger rail volumes, although there would be an extended period of slowness first followed by a spike in volumes. It may push things to the back half of the year more so than we thought, Hamann said at the Barclays conference. Should there be a spike in rail demand later this year, UP would handle it similarly to how it managed rail volumes following severe flooding in the Midwest last spring. That might mean focusing on running the manifest network and the terminals consistently over rushing to get rail operations back in order, according to Union Pacific (UP) CEO Lance Fritz. It's a false choice to think you've got to sacrifice operational efficiencies and service products in times of change. When volumes spike or drop dramatically and radically, that puts all the more pressure on running the network consistently and reliably, Fritz said at the Barclays conference. He continued, When things change directly and quickly, it is the hardest time to run the network. … But the answer is not to flood the network with equipment but to stay disciplined. Rail's Effort To Gain Market Share From Trucks Although UP has been working to increase network reliability, the railroad is also seeking to tailor its network to allow for more truck conversion opportunities, such as by locating intermodal terminals near highways, helping customer find tracks that are shared by several industries and have warehousing capabilities, and finding potential sites to develop new facilities, according to UP's Hamann. UP is also watching whether e-commerce shippers opt for mega-size distribution centers or for smaller, regional distribution centers that can accommodate a faster turnaround, Hamann said at a Stifel conference on Feb. 11. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), which hasn't attended the recent investor conferences, said recently that in 2019, the railroad invested nearly $2 billion across 16 states, working with 77 businesses to develop new or expanded rail facilities on Norfolk Southern's lines. Executives at CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) said its strategies to compete with the truck market include measures that don't add more assets to CSX's existing network. CSX is considering running longer trains, such as lengthening merchandise trains from about 100 cars to 150 and upping intermodal trains from 140 containers to about 300. It's really [about] leveraging the costs base, CSX CFO Kevin Boone said at the Barclays conference. Improving service and efficiencies might also help CSX find short-haul opportunities at lengths as short as 350-400 miles versus a more traditional 500 miles. Our addressable market versus three years ago has expanded significantly from where we were, Boone said. Mark Wallace, CSX's executive vice president of sales and marketing, said at the Citi conference Feb. 19 that CSX's channel partners have told CSX there is highway traffic that would be better suited for intermodal, and so the marketplace still has additional opportunities for conversion from truck. But in the near term, U.S. truck capacity is still loose, and so for rail volumes to grow in the second half of the year, macroeconomic conditions would have to encourage conversions to rail, Wallace said. There is an expectation that there's a little more confidence that things will tighten up. For me, it's wait and see. … Clearly the environment is sort of what it has been, Wallace said. Opportunities In Canada For over two weeks starting Feb. 6, protesters have been creating rail blockades in support of a First Nations group's objections to the proposed location of a fracked gas pipeline. A blockade in Mohawk territory near Belleville, Ontario, began in solidarity with efforts by the hereditary leaders of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation in British Columbia to fight the proposed route of the Coastal GasLink pipeline through their territory in British Columbia. The blockades affected mainly Canadian National's (CN) operations, although passenger rail service VIA Rail also canceled rail service for most routes for several days while one-day blockades also occurred on CP's network. The blockade near Belleville caused CN to shut down its eastern operations and disrupted other supply chain partners. Although Canada's federal government on Tuesday negotiated with protesters to dismantle and remove the rail blockade near Belleville, CN is still ramping up operations. But last week, when the rail blockades were still in full effect, CN executives said the railway wasn't panicking, in part because CN's eastern network is underutilized. CN also reportedly worked with CP and short lines to move some volumes through during the protests, according to local reports. Furthermore, the timing of the blockades missed the busier period between March and October, according to CN CFO Ghislain Houle. We're moving through the backlog that occurred as a result of rail blockades in Western Canada, Houle said at the Barclays conference. … At this point, we're not panicking. There's business out there. For example, rail volumes per revenue ton mile are up 29% year-to-date as of last week at the Port of Prince Rupert even with the blockades that occurred on CN's western network, Houle said. Meanwhile, both CP and CN expect to move more crude oil volumes via rail, especially now that the Alberta government on Feb. 11 divested the province's crude-by rail contracts to the private sector. As a result, an additional 120,000 barrels per day of takeaway capacity could come online, the government said. The 19 contracts, which include information on railcars, loading and unloading capacity, logistics, and other services, are being finalized by the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission. CN has the capacity to move as much as 300,000 barrels annually, and the company sees crude-by-rail as a growth opportunity in 2020 and 2021. Although long-term prospects for crude-by-rail are uncertain, the privatization of the contracts could encourage producers to diversify their transportation options and consider capital projects that would allow for more crude products to ship via rail, executives said. The heavy crude that can move by rail can come directly from the refinery and can result in a premium for the refiner, so some refiners will be deciding by year's end whether they should consider crude-by-rail for the long term, said CN CEO JJ Ruest at the Citi investor conference. CP calculates it has 140,000-150,000 barrels of annual capacity available for crude-by-rail. The railway plans to keep its capacity where it is so that it isn't left with excess capacity once the pipelines are in place, executives said. I want to move your product, to move it safely, but I can't let it outstrip our capacity, CP's Creel said at the Citi conference. Image Sourced from Pixabay"
2020-03-05,Norfolk Southern Announces Leadership Changes,"Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) has shuffled its leadership roster as it rounds out its first year of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operating model that seeks to streamline operations. Norfolk Southern (NS) has appointed three people to new roles, effective immediately: Greg Comstock is vice president of network operations after serving as a general manager of the network operations center and general manager of NS' southern region; Lorrie Kleine is vice president of law after serving as senior general counsel for workforce, properties and insurance risk management; and Patrick Whitehead is vice president of transportation after serving as assistant vice president for mechanical and general manager for NS' northern region. These leaders have made important contributions to the company, and I am pleased to announce their well-deserved promotions, said NS CEO Jim Squires. Greg and Pat have played significant roles in our ongoing and successful implementation of precision scheduled railroading, and Lorri is a Norfolk Southern leader with extensive legal and external strategic governance experience. NS also appointed Josh Raglin to serve as chief sustainability officer, where he will seek to integrate sustainability practices into daily operations, NS said. Raglin recently served NS as general manager of facilities. Josh's experience and knowledge will be invaluable as we work to fulfill our commitment to environmental, social and governance practices that positively impact the environment, while simultaneously supporting the growth and evolution of our company, Squires said. Comstock and Whitehead will be working together in their new roles to execute NS' operating plan and eke out additional network efficiencies, NS said. Comstock will oversee NS' Network Operations Center, which is where centralized dispatching occurs. Whitehead will oversee NS' field operations, including the execution of the railroad's PSR operating plan named TOP21, which the railroad began rolling out formally in July 2019 after some preliminary legwork. Kleine will oversee legal, claims, investigative, compliance and risk management affairs for the NS law department. She has worked in that department since 1994.

2020-03-06,Norfolk Southern Tests Breakthrough Track Inspection Technology,"Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) is conducting a pilot program testing what the railroad describes as a breakthrough in track inspection technology. The Eastern U.S. railroad is deploying an autonomous track geometry measurement system, which Norfolk Southern (NS) says is the first technology of its kind among the North American freight railroads. While the autonomous track inspection systems available today are installed on converted freight or passenger rail cars and require an external power source to operate, the NS system is mounted on a locomotive. With our locomotive-based system, we use an existing asset to increase the frequency of our track inspections, without adding another piece of equipment that has to be run across the railroad, said Ed Boyle, NS vice president of engineering. The pilot is occurring on a mainline between Norfolk, Virginia, and Portsmouth, Ohio, on a route that has a range of track and operating conditions, such as straight and curved track, hilly terrain and high tonnage loads, NS said. NS says the autonomous system enables real-time, precise and quality track inspections while trains are loaded and going at track speed. The data from the autonomous system will help NS determine track activities and capital budgeting needs. NS says the system will help NS be compliant with company and Federal Railroad Administration track safety standards. With this innovative system, any time this locomotive is moving and pulling freight, it is testing track at the same time, said Mike Allran, NS manager for track inspection and development. Allran helped lead the development of this system. This gives us more robust data for use in predictive-modeling to determine track maintenance intervals, which enables us to maximize efficiencies that will generate significant cost savings. The railroad's track inspection group within the NS engineering department developed this system. It is mounted in a ruggedized box under a six-axle road locomotive between the snow plow and the first set of wheels, NS said. A computer, housed inside the electrical locker in the locomotive cab, powers the system. NS describes the autonomous system as consisting of lasers, gyros, accelerometers, and global positioning system sensors [that can] detect defects or anomalies in track geometry, including track gauge, or the distance between rails, and the elevation and curvature of track. The system transmits inspection data wirelessly to office locations, where track geometry engineers confirm potential defects and notify track maintenance personnel. The railroad expects the system on the locomotive to supplement existing testing already occurring through a fleet of manned tracked geometry cars and hi-rail trucks. NS hopes to equip additional locomotives with this technology; the railroad also plans to upgrade the technology through the addition of an optical system to evaluate track components such as fasteners, rail welds and switch points.

2020-03-13,Freight Railroads Monitor Network For Coronavirus Impacts,"Freight railroads are alerting customers of their plans to address the coronavirus in North America, and they urged their customers to notify them if their supply chain changes. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) says it's taking steps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus across its rail network, including ensuring safe workplaces, studying remote work options for some employees and creating a task force to address the situation, the company said in an operations notice to its customers. Contingency planning is ongoing. We are focused most acutely on mission-critical functions, including transportation planning and operations, customer service, equipment management, train reporting and work orders, ensuring we have plans in place to maintain adequate staffing and a safe, effective work environment, Norfolk Southern (NS) chief marketing officer Alan Shaw said in a March 12 operations note. Those measures include ensuring that all workplaces are stocked with cleaning and disinfecting products, modifying work areas to allow for additional spatial separation and tasking NS's chief medical officer to monitor guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). NS is also preparing its employees, systems and communication infrastructure to work remotely when applicable and should the need arise, the company said. The railroad has formed a Pandemic Planning Task Force consisting of representatives of all departments to review internal work group contingency plans and procedures. The eastern U.S. railroad also urged customers to notify it of any changes or disruptions to their supply chains or operations. Should the need arise, we are preparing to activate our Command Center, staffed by all areas essential to train operations. I commit to you that we will make certain we communicate all changes to you, our customers and supply chain partners, as we move forward, Shaw said. In turn, we encourage you to advise us with respect to anticipated changes in your supply chains so that we can continue to evaluate and, if necessary, modify our operating plans accordingly to meet your service expectations. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) said in a March 6 customer update that it has been actively monitoring the situation, and it is following CDC guidelines for businesses. The western U.S. railroad developed a cross-departmental pandemic team in 2006 that developed business continuity plans. Union Pacific (UP) has put into place a pandemic operating plan that includes a Command Center to ensure continued train operations. The team at the center is responsible for transportation plan adjustments, traffic diversions and equipment planning, and it will ensure communication protocols between customers and operating and support staff, said Kenny Rocker, UP's executive vice president for marketing and sales. UP also asked customers to alert the railroad should any changes occur to customers' supply chains. If you are expecting an increase of product imported from China or from a secondary source, such as local suppliers, we would like to keep in close contact as you gain clarity on when your volumes are expected to pick up again. If you are able to let us know the timing and quantity of those anticipated volume levels, we will do our part to be ready to handle the volume when it arrives, Rocker said. The more we can understand what your forecasted shipments might look like and when they will happen, the better we can help provide the transportation solutions you need to keep your supply chain running smoothly.

2020-03-16,Freight Railroads Further Adjust Workforce Plans Amid Coronavirus Pandemic,"The freight railroads are monitoring the latest developments related to the coronavirus pandemic while adjusting working conditions and preparing for an anticipated surge in volumes once the outbreak subsides, according to recent operations notifications. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) changed some of its work procedures from even a few days ago, aligning them with social distancing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), according to a March 14 note from its chief marketing officer Alan Shaw. Some of the changes include transitioning work arrangements for those not directly associated with train operations and restricting access to critical functions to offices such as the Network Operations Center. The eastern U.S. railroad has also activated its Operations Command Center, which includes staff from marketing and customer service, to monitor operations. It is also ensuring proper sanitation for its field transportation employees. In regard to shippers, Norfolk Southern is committed to providing transparent information on all our activities and any changes we may execute, Shaw said. We encourage you to advise us with respect to anticipated changes in your supply chains, operations or priorities so that we can continue to evaluate and, if necessary, modify our operating plans accordingly to meet your service expectations. Canadian National (NYSE:CNI) said its intermodal offering can aid customers that are affected by the dwindling availability of truck drivers. Since our recovery from the illegal blockades is progressing well, we are working closely with our customers to further assist them in getting more of their goods to end markets as Canadian National's (CN) strong intermodal capacity can definitely increase to compensate for the diminishing availability of long-haul truck drivers, CN said. The railway also said it is following safety directives from the World Health Organization and from provincial, state and federal authorities in Canada and the U.S. In a March 13 customer update, BNSF (NYSE:BRK) said it has plans to keep operations going should there be any workforce disruptions, including those caused by a pandemic. Measures will include designating essential personnel and ensuring that there are train crews available to keep trains moving. All BNSF facilities remain open, the railroad said. BNSF asked customers to share information with BNSF about its needs, especially once volumes rebound as the pandemic threat fades. Once conditions have improved, we are aware of concerns about the ability to support a spike in volumes involving North American supply chains. BNSF is working closely with our partners to ensure that resources are positioned where they will be needed most, BNSF said. In this effort, we would like to remind customers to please share information on anticipated volumes with your BNSF representative as frequently as possible. With your ongoing collaboration, we are confident that we have the equipment, facilities and other resources ready to handle an expected demand surge in the coming weeks. The railroad also said it is following guidelines provided by the CDC and public health agencies, and it is taking measures such as cleaning and sanitizing BNSF facilities more frequently and restricting employee travel.

2020-03-24,Rail Unions Seek Federal Help In Ensuring Coronavirus Response,"Two railroad labor unions are pressing the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to issue emergency orders pushing the freight and passenger railroads to adopt protective measures more speedily amid the growing coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. The requests come amid reports in social media that some Class I railroads have been slow to comply or insufficient in their response to FRA's March 14 declaration that the U.S. is in an emergency situation and so emergency relief provisions should apply to the railroads. Some workers have said they don't have enough cleaning supplies available for the number of employees who need those supplies, or efforts to adequately clean and sanitize equipment in areas such as inside the locomotive cab have been lax. The employees we represent are essential to the health, safety, and security of the nation. Therefore, it is necessary that the railroads take immediate and appropriate precautions to mitigate against the spread of the virus amongst their workforces, to minimize the exposure of their employees to the virus during the performance of their duties, and that Class I railroads maintain sufficient staffing levels to compensate for reduced headcounts caused by sick employees and family members, as well as to seamlessly handle predicted increases in volume once the virus begins to subside, according to a petition to FRA signed by Jeremy R. Ferguson, president of the Transportation Division of the Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation (SMART) association, and Dennis R. Pierce, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET). The unions contend that many rail carriers have been slow or neglectful about adopting measures recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 or the coronavirus in the areas of locomotive sanitation, sanitation of employees' common areas, employee temperature monitoring and sanitation of crew transportation vehicles. They also say FRA has not issued any action plans to help the railroads meet CDC recommendations. The unions had sent a letter to FRA earlier this month asking the agency to develop an action plan for the freight railroads that addresses the outbreak. The unions said they are also seeking to modify how an employee documents hours-of-service reports to accommodate longer wait times for meals, and they want procedures addressing how the railroads handle employees who develop coronavirus symptoms to ensure they follow CDC guidelines. The unions also want 25% of furloughed rail personnel to be recalled to service immediately to deal with anticipated shortages and staffing needs, per President Donald Trump's invocation of the Defense Production Act. FRA said it has received the unions' petitions and it is formulating a response. Separately, the Association of American Railroads (AAR), which represents the Class I railroads and Amtrak, said Friday that the railroads are responding to the outbreak, with the companies' chief medical officers working to update procedures as needs arise. In addition to efforts to encourage employees to stay home if they're sick and practice social distancing, the industry has been hosting daily calls among companies' cross-functional teams to share data and best practices. As COVID-19 continues to evolve, North America's freight railroads are safeguarding the health and safety of their dedicated rail workforce while maintaining the flow of goods necessary to preserve public health and sustain families. As the situation remains fluid, railroads will continue to monitor the situation closely and modify their response accordingly, AAR said. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) have outlined in notifications to customers some of the measures both railroads are taking to address the outbreak. These measures come amid reports that some employees have contracted the novel coronavirus. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. has also reported that Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) grappled initially with how to handle employees who have traveled, while NBC Nebraska has said a second Union Pacific employee has contracted COVID-19. That employee worked with one who had contracted the virus after going on a cruise, and the employee was in self-quarantine already because of his exposure to his colleague."
2020-03-25,Norfolk Southern Names A New Executive Vice President,"Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) promoted Vanessa Allen Sutherland to executive vice president and chief legal officer, effective April 1. Allen Sutherland had just been promoted to senior vice president of government relations and chief legal officer last August. In that role, she worked to develop relationships with federal, state and local stakeholders. She joined Norfolk Southern (NS) in 2018 as vice president of law, and in that role, she led a review of the NS safety program, managed government relations initiatives, introduced automation at multiple levels with the law team and collaborated with peers on short line railroad matters, NS said. Vanessa is an invaluable contributor to NS, with important responsibilities across a number of areas critical to our company's success, NS CEO James A. Squires said. Most recently, Vanessa has been playing an integral role in helping NS navigate the economic, political and regulatory environment. We thank her for her hard work and commitment to ensuring that our company continues to deliver superior returns for investors, and outstanding service to customers, while keeping our employees and communities safe."
2020-03-27,Freight Rail And Partners Outline Coronavirus Responses,"Freight rail and intermodal companies have been developing plans to ensure that business operations continue as near to normal as possible as the coronavirus pandemic plays out in North America. Kansas City Southern Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) says the U.S.-Mexico border remains open to the commercial movement of goods and railroads are deemed critical infrastructure by the federal government. However, the railroad has had to adjust some trip plans and transportation schedules to align with customer demand. Policies for remote work and social distancing have been instituted for applicable employees, and the company has implemented a robust cleaning and sanitizing effort for all work and common areas, Kansas City Southern (KCS) said in a March 25 customer notice. As for ensuring the continuity of business operations, KCS said it holds daily briefings both internally and with local, state and federal agencies. It is also working with its vendors and partners to ensure the availability of or materials and resources. KCS has also diversified its work locations temporarily, including its network operations offices. KCS has the ability to temporarily relocate crew and employees to locations of need, and they have job boards for train field employees in the event of crew shortages. Additional information on how KCS is addressing the pandemic can be found here. CSX CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX) has no confirmed cases of any employee who has contracted the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, as of the start of this week, according to a March 24 customer notice from Mark Wallace, CSX executive vice president of sales and marketing. CSX urged customers to inform the railroad if their transportation needs changes or require service adjustments. The railroad is taking comprehensive measures to safeguard our workers and our facilities so that we can continue to provide normal operations and timely service, Wallace said. CSX has also developed business continuity plans that include backup facilities where business-critical functions, such as CSX's data center and network operations teams, are able to transition and continue seamless train operation, Wallace said in a March 18 customer note. To ensure crew availability, CSX has reserve operating employees and manager certifications available, and the railroad has established safety protocols for facility sterilization. CSX has also conducted work-from-home drills for its technology teams and other functions that support customer relations, Wallace said. Norfolk Southern Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) has been surveying customers to gauge their transportation requirements in light of the coronavirus pandemic and state and local orders to shelter in place. Norfolk Southern is working to integrate your feedback into our transportation plans, ensuring we continue to meet your needs and our operations remain fluid. As changes are identified to our service, we will notify affected customers and work with you to resolve any issues. We will work collaboratively with our customers and business partners, Norfolk Southern Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw said in a March 23 customer notice. We understand that COVID-19 mitigation efforts are dynamic and the effect on our customers' business needs may evolve. Norfolk Southern will continue to collaborate with our customers and business partners to assess your service needs and how best to respond to the potential changes in your logistics requirements, Shaw said. Trac Intermodal Trac Intermodal, a marine chassis pool manager and equipment provider, says it has business continuity plans in place and it is following health guidance to clean and disinfect service vehicles and TRAC's locations. The company's field operations have been deemed as essential, meaning that operations can continue in areas where there are state orders to shelter in place. We continue to work closely with our network of start/stop locations and depots to support the intermodal community, TRAC Intermodal said. American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association The American Short Line and Regional Railroad Association has a list of resources for short line railroads that detail recent government actions, including what temporary waivers from federal mandates are available."
2020-04-03,Norfolk Southern Cautions Feds About Coronavirus Risks,"The coronavirus pandemic could impact the financial results of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC), although the magnitude of COVID-19's effects on the railroad's operations remains to be seen, the railroad said in a Thursday filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Norfolk Southern (NS) said it didn't take into account the pandemic when it issued its guidance for 2020 during its fourth-quarter 2019 earnings call in late January. NS will update SEC on the pandemic's associated risks after it releases its first-quarter results on April 29. NS follows its competitor CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) as well as Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) in alerting the SEC about the pandemic's potential impact on operations. The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing and generating significant uncertainty in the economy, and it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, dependent on numerous risks and uncertainties. NS said. The railroad continued, The magnitude and duration of the outbreak, its impact on our supply chain partners and general economic conditions, and the extent of social distancing measures and non-essential business shutdowns will influence the demand for our services and affect our revenues. In addition, COVID-19 could affect our operations and business continuity if a significant number of our essential employees, overall or in a key location, are quarantined from contraction of or exposure to the disease or if governmental orders prevent our operating employees or critical suppliers from working."
2020-04-09,Coronavirus Takes Aim At North American Rail Traffic,"North American rail traffic continues to tumble, pressured by significant drops in consumer activity as the COVID-19 pandemic takes hold globally. North American rail volume for the week ending last Saturday slipped 16.1% to 596,710 carloads and intermodal units, compared with the same period in 2019, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) said on Wednesday. On a year-to-date basis, rail volumes were down 6.7% to nearly 9.1 million carloads and intermodal units. Meanwhile, U.S. rail volumes fell 15.9% on a weekly basis to 429,095 carloads and intermodal units, and they slipped 8.1% for the first 14 weeks of 2020 to 6.6 million carloads and intermodal units. U.S. rail carloads (RTOTC.USA) are down by double-digit percentages from a year ago, as are U.S. intermodal containers (RTOIC.CLASSI) and trailers (RTOIT.CLASSI). Source: SONAR/AAR The impact of the novel coronavirus on railroads is growing, said AAR Senior Vice President John T. Gray. Since 1988, when our data began, total U.S. rail carloads were lower than they were last week only during a few Christmas and New Year's weeks, when rail operations are seasonally low. Part of the problem now is sustained weakness in coal carloads, but even excluding coal, carloads last week were down 13.1%. We haven't seen sustained declines of that magnitude since the Great Recession. With many consumers staying at home because of COVID-19, carloads for a number of commodities have dropped significantly, either because of the evaporation of consumer demand or because of slowing industrial activity. Weekly carloads of motor vehicles and parts tumbled 82.6% last week to 4,867, with caloads down 84% from just three weeks ago. These declines made carloads of autos and auto parts the worst performing commodity category of the week, according to AAR. But other commodities fell as well, including a 17.6% drop for nonmetallic minerals and a 13.7% decline for petroleum and petroleum products. Based on rail data, it's clear that many sectors of U.S. industry are beginning to feel the impact of coronavirus disruptions, Gray said. Source: AAR What's going to happen to rail volumes and equipment in the second quarter? The Class I railroads will be kicking off earnings season next week, with Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) being the first to announce its first-quarter earnings on April 17. How the railroads will adjust their sales guidance for 2020 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic remains to be seen, but CSX Corporation (NYSE:CSX), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) have warned the Securities and Exchange Commission that the outbreak may materially affect their financial results. How rail volumes fare over these next several months also affects rail equipment manufacturers since they also must adjust production to projected volumes. Greenbrier is focused on two primary goals: protecting the safety and health of employees and preserving the economic well-being of our enterprise in this challenging environment. We are executing on the latter by increasing liquidity and sizing the organization properly in the current business environment, said Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (NYSE:GBX) Chairman and CEO William A. Furman on Tuesday. Greenbrier announced its results for its fiscal second quarter that ended on Feb. 29. During its earnings call, Greenbrier said it has implemented a new round of cost initiatives in response to the downturn in railcar demand that is likely to be worsened by the COVID-19 outbreak. It reduced headcount, largely in Mexico, has eliminated nonessential capital expenditures (capex) and is aggressively reducing operating expenses. Those plans include corporate travel restrictions, a hiring freeze and executive pay cuts. Greenbrier has reduced its manufacturing footprint by idling excess capacity throughout North America, including its aftermarket wheels, repair and parts locations, FreightWaves reported. The company has slowed production rates at some facilities to keep those production lines active versus idling. Expect intermodal volumes to fall this spring U.S. intermodal volumes tumbled 15.7% last week to 218,184 intermodal containers and trailers as consumer spending dried up amid shelter-in-place orders across many U.S. states. Year-to-date U.S. intermodal volume is down 9.1% to nearly 3.4 million intermodal units. Intermodal volumes in the U.S. (RTOIC.USA), Canada (RTOIC.CAN) and Mexico (RTOIC.MEX) over the past year. Source: SONAR/AAR With China in the very early stages of its own recovery, whether intermodal volumes will continue to fall — and if they do continue to fall, how far — will now depend to a large extent on what happens with consumer spending in North America, Gray said. That, in turn, will depend on how long social distancing steps must remain in place; how well and how quickly federal and state unemployment insurance and other programs fill gaps in household cash flows; and how much the current situation causes consumers to lose long-term confidence and remain in retrench mode not just when health concerns begin to recede but, more importantly, when they have been largely resolved, Gray continued. Other groups have expressed similar sentiments. The National Retail Federation (NRF) said on Tuesday that imports at the major U.S. retail container ports fell to their lowest level in five years in March, and that lower level is expected to continue through the early summer as the pandemic ripples across the globe and through the North American supply chain. Even as factories in China have begun to get back to work, we are seeing far fewer imports coming into the United States than previously expected, NRF Vice President for Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said. NRF produces a monthly report on port volumes, Global Port Tracker, with Hackett Associates. Many stores are closed, and consumer demand has been impacted with millions of Americans out of work. However, there are still many essential items that are badly needed, and because of store closures cargo may sit longer than usual and cause other supply chain impacts, Gold continued. NRF and Hackett Associates warned that even though the drop in port volumes will be deeper in the first half of the year, prospects for a sustained volume recovery in the second half of the year are still largely uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic is unraveling the economy nationally and globally as most of the world moves toward a lockdown that entails the closure of significant portions of both the service and manufacturing industries, Hackett Associates Founder Ben Hackett said. The largest drop is forecast for the first half of this year, but with uncertainty about the length of the lockdown and extent of the pandemic, the second half may not be in better shape. According to their Global Port Tracker, U.S. ports handled 1.51 million twenty-foot equivalents units (TEUs) in February, down 17% from January and 6.8% lower than February 2019. February's volumes are typically lower because of the Lunar New Year celebrations in China, although the coronavirus outbreak there extended factory shutdowns. Global Port Tracker estimates that imports in March will be 21.3% lower year-over-year to 1.27 million TEUs. That would be the lowest level since February 2015, which is when labor disputes at the West Coast ports slowed operations. The report also forecasts port volumes to be 8.93 million TEUs for the first half of 2020, which is 15.1% lower than the same period in 2019. In contrast, earlier forecasts before the pandemic put volumes at 10.47 million TEUs. Image: Flickr/Joe Wolf"

2020-04-29,Locomotive Costs Dent Norfolk Southern's First-Quarter Profits,"The costs associated with Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) actions to divest a portion of its locomotive fleet resulted in lower net profits for the company in the first quarter. First-quarter net income was $381 million, or $1.47/diluted share, compared with $677 million, or $2.51/diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019. The 2020 first-quarter results take into account a $385 million non-cash locomotive rationalization charge related to the ongoing disposition and marketing of excess locomotives, Norfolk Southern (NS) said. NS attributed its decision to divest a portion of its locomotive fleet to its deployment of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operating model that seeks to streamline operations. Without the $385 million charge, NS' first-quarter net income on a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis was $669 million, or $2.58/diluted share. In the first quarter, operating revenues fell on lower carload volumes. NS' operating revenues dropped 8% to $2.6 billion on an 11% dip in rail volumes. Operating expenses also rose in part because of the $385 million non-cash charge related to the locomotives. Operating expenses were $2.1 billion, compared with $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2019. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $1.7 billion. Source: NS The operating ratio (OR) for the first quarter was 78.4%, compared with 66% a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, OR was 63.7%. A lower OR can imply a company's improved financial performance. Meanwhile, service metrics improved in the first quarter, with terminal dwell, or the amount of time a train spends at a terminal, down 16% to 18.6 hours, and train speed up 10% to 23.8 miles per hour. Source: NS During the first quarter, Norfolk Southern's determination to transform our operations once again produced all-time best service delivery levels accompanied by productivity improvements, despite volumes being impacted by weak energy prices and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, said Jim Squires, Norfolk Southern chairman, president and CEO. While it is unclear how long economic activity will remain suppressed, we are dedicated to serving our customers and keeping our employees healthy and safe while navigating the downturn so that we can emerge strong and resilient for our shareholders. I am extremely proud of the commitment and strength the Norfolk Southern team has displayed by keeping our nation's freight moving during this challenging start to 2020 while also enhancing our financial position. Second-quarter volumes have fallen 30% quarter-to-date across all commodity segments, which sets up a very soft revenue outlook for the quarter. As a result of this and the continued economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic, NS is withdrawing its financial guidance for the year. While the COVID-19 pandemic will affect business volumes for the year, the PSR implementation that our team is executing upon will generate significant operating expense savings in 2020, said NS Chief Financial Officer Mark R. George. In this challenging environment our team is doubling down on examination of our structural cost opportunities to ensure that we remain positioned to drive enhanced profitability for the long term."
2020-04-29,Norfolk Southern Anticipates Some Cost Cuts As Permanent,"Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) expects some of the cost cuts it made in response to the pandemic-induced rail volume decline to be permanent, its executives said during the eastern U.S. railroad's first-quarter 2020 earnings call today. The railroad has removed excess locomotives and reduced crew starts, with expectations to cut crew starts even further, executives said. Norfolk Southern (NS) is also examining which terminals and rail yards to close, including outlying smaller yards that we can continue to live without, according to NS Chief Operating Officer Mike Wheeler. These operational changes, while hastened by the COVID-19 pandemic, are also part of NS' broader efforts to implement TOP21, NS' version of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operating model that seeks to streamline operations and cut costs. We're pressing the TOP21 accelerator right now, the railroad's CEO Jim Squires said. Another operational change has been to blend trains so that a train carries various commodities instead of a single commodity. NS has blended its general merchandise and bulk trains into its intermodal trains, and it is starting to blend its premium trains. We're to the point now where a train is a train…and a [commodity] can ride on the train that gives it the right service requirements it needs, Wheeler said. NS Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw added that the blended trains give NS a broader product offering by enabling shippers new access to existing lanes. To accommodate anticipated future demand once rail volumes rebound, NS executives said the railroad will have capacity through its longer trains and at its terminals. NS would deploy these measures first before it would start considering increasing train starts again. During phase 3 of its plan to implement TOP21, NS' rail volumes have fallen 11% while train crew starts declined by 19% in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2019. An increase in train starts would depend on how traffic comes back, but we've got awhile before NS will consider increasing train starts, Wheeler said. The decision to divest of around 700 locomotives was also part of NS' plan to deploy PSR, since keeping the locomotives only adds to maintenance and storage costs. NS is seeking a target fleet size of around 3,200 locomotives, of which 420 locomotives would be inactive or for use in conditions where capacity needs surge. This is in contrast to over 3,900 active and inactive locomotives at the end of December 2019. It's healthier to get the surplus [through] upfront and move them out as quickly as possible, than to parse out the divestment over time, according to NS Chief Financial Officer Mark George. NS also decided to trim its capital expenditures (capex) budget for 2020 by about 25% to $1.5 billion, compared with $2 billion for 2019, as part of wider company efforts to run a leaner operation. The capex budget reduction occurred across the board, with cuts in budgets for maintenance, information technology and terminals, among other avenues. We really got together as a team and reiterated what we could do to reduce capital spend and get to a low level, George said, adding that NS sensed that there would be volume pressure in 2020. From here, I would hope we would be able to maintain capex at a moderate pace. Despite taking back its financial guidance for the year, including expectations for its annual operating ratio (OR), NS is still maintaining its OR guidance of 60% for 2021. OR, which is a company's operating expenses as a percentage of its revenue, has been used as an indicator to gauge the financial health of a company. A lower OR percentage can imply improved financial health. NS' OR for 2019 was 64.7% NS acknowledged that one of its biggest competitors right now is the spot trucking market, but the railroad said that it is maintaining a long-term view and pricing to the value of the product and the franchise. Market conditions are similar to what NS experienced in 2009 and 2010 during the Great Recession, according to Alan Shaw, NS chief marketing officer. NS will continue to collaborate with supply chain and channel partners and look for new lanes to sell capacity, all while doing so at a lower cost structure, Shaw said. First-quarter financial results The costs associated with NS' actions to divest a portion of its locomotive fleet resulted in lower net profits for the company in the first quarter. First-quarter net income was $381 million, or $1.47/diluted share, compared with $677 million, or $2.51/diluted share, in the first quarter of 2019. The 2020 first-quarter results take into account a $385 million non-cash locomotive rationalization charge related to the ongoing disposition and marketing of excess locomotives, NS said.

2020-05-21,Rail Pins Hopes On Auto Manufacturing As US Carloads Sustain Record Decline,"The Class I railroads are closely watching the restart of North American automotive production, hoping that the slow ramp up will not only grow auto volumes but also improve demand for supplies such as steel and plastics, according to executives at recent investor conferences. However, a key unknown variable is whether consumer demand will lift volumes for automobiles and other goods, executives said. Our auto plants reopened this week with very limited production. The sustainability of that production is going to be highly dependent on consumer demand and consumer confidence to go out there and buy automobiles, said Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw during Wolfe Research's virtual conference for investors on Wednesday, May 20. Limited auto production resumed this week among major U.S. automakers, according to various news reports, and production in Mexico is expected to restart on June 1 although the government previously announced it would begin production in mid-May. Shaw added that the slow ramp-up in auto production would also likely result in puts and takes for auto suppliers since some supplies, such as steel, are already at the plants. The auto industry's suppliers might not see demand recovery until auto production has been up and running for some time, according to Shaw. While CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) view on the market remains relatively unchanged since its first-quarter earnings call in April, the reopening of the Big Three automakers might help the railroad get some clarity on merchandise volumes for the remainder of the second quarter and into the third quarter, according to Mark Wallace, CSX's executive vice president of sales and marketing. Wallace also noted during the Wolfe conference how products feeding into auto manufacturing, such as plastics and steel, could benefit from the reopening of the auto manufacturing plants. Meanwhile, Wallace's colleague at CSX, Chief Financial Officer Kevin Boone, said last week that CSX was starting to see some very small car orders coming through the auto manufacturing plants. But Boone also noted it would be a couple of weeks before any sizable volumes appeared. This will be a slow ramp-up, and they're focused on protecting their workforce as well, Boone said at the Bank of America Securities Transportation and Industrials conference on May 12. But certainly going zero to something is helpful. Although revenue ton miles for Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) are at the bottom for the second quarter, with revenue and volumes ebbing and flowing for the rest of May, the return of automotive production should provide some uplift for the railway, said CP President and CEO Keith Creel at the Wolfe Research conference on May 20. We're experiencing unique growth in the sector given our partners, Creel said, noting that production would restart soon at Toyota, Honda and Chrysler, while shipments are expected to resume at CP's Vancouver automotive compound. Creel also said volumes would be climbing out in the third quarter, followed by flattish volumes in the fourth quarter and strength in the first quarter of 2021. The standstill in North American automotive production contributed greatly to the decline in rail volumes, with North American traffic for motor vehicles and parts falling 36.4% year-to-date to 335,839 carloads, according to the Association of American Railroads (AAR). The data is for the week ending May 16. On a weekly basis, North American carloads fell 87.9% to 3,467 carloads. North American carloads of motor vehicles and parts tumbled between March and April. (SONAR: RTOMV.USA, RTOMV.CAN, RTOMV.MEX) How the Class I railroads are cutting costs To counter tumbling rail volumes, the Class I railroads are continuing to apply some of the cost-control measures that they mentioned during their first-quarter earnings calls last month, including cutting their budgets for capital investments to focus on essential projects or maintenance, putting employees on furlough and ceasing operations at smaller rail yards, and storing hundreds of locomotives and railcars until demand improves. Other costs are more variable, such as fuel expenses. Many of the railroads also said they have reserve boards consisting of furloughed employees who can return to work quickly should there be a sudden rebound in volumes. It gets harder to offset the volume declines as they accelerate, CSX's Boone said. He also said the current environment has prompted CSX to evaluate all its costs. The cost-cutting measures in turn make it harder to provide any guidance on where a company's operating ratio might be for the year, according to Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI) President and CEO JJ Ruest. There is usually a lag when responding to lower volumes through layoffs and parking rolling stock. The drop in revenue in April and May has been so drastic. It's hard to keep up with the cost reduction without any timeline, Ruest said at the Bank of American conference on May 12. One structural change Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) is tackling is how it operates its manifest network, which consists of trains made up with a variety of commodities as compared to a single commodity, like a unit train for grain. The railroad is eyeing running longer trains and making capital investments to sidings to allow for longer trains at its facilities. Running longer trains not only reduces crew starts but it also involves utilizing fewer assets to move the same amount of carloads, which in turn affects UP's productivity, according to UP's Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Hamann. The thing we're very encouraged about is that when we think about that productivity number, it's not just coming from one category, Hamann said May 12 at the Bank of America investor conference. Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) also said it might keep some of the operations changes made as a result of the pandemic, such as reducing train starts and lengthening trains. Both actions cleansed the network, enabling velocity to increase because there are fewer trains running on the network, said Sameh Fahmy, KCS executive vice president for precision scheduled railroading, at the May 12 conference. We're not going back to 100 train starts when everything returns to normal, Fahmy said. We found the trick; we know how to do it now with smaller yards. U.S. carloads witness largest weekly decline U.S. weekly carloads experienced their largest percentage decline ever since AAR began collecting rail volume data in 1988. U.S. weekly carloads fell 30.2% to 184,425 carloads. Year-to-date, U.S. carloads were down 13.6% to 4.3 million carloads. The 30.2% decline in total U.S. carloads last week was the biggest year-over-year weekly decline for total carloads since 1988, when our data began. Coal didn't help – last week was the fifth straight week in which coal carloads were down at least 40% from last year, said AAR Senior Vice President John T. Gray. For many other key rail commodities, including chemicals, petroleum products, and crushed stone and sand, carloads last week were roughly the same as in the previous few weeks, while intermodal originations last week were the most in eight weeks. Meanwhile, U.S. intermodal volumes slipped 14% on a weekly basis to 231,700 intermodal containers and trailers, while year-to-date volumes fell 11.4% to 4.7 million intermodal units.

2020-06-01,Shippers Warn Of Antitrust Ramifications,"Shippers are concerned that the freight railroads' justification over alleged price-fixing that occurred in the early 2000s could open the door towards loosening antitrust laws. The concerns are related to lawsuits from dozens of shippers aimed at four U.S. Class I railroads, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and BNSF (NYSE:BRK). The lawsuits allege that between 2003 and 2008, these four railroads applied fuel surcharges on rail rates that weren't related to fuel. The shippers argue that the purpose of the fuel surcharges and the fuel cost recovery program was to garner additional revenue. There are two proceedings in the federal appeals court before two judges. They involve multiple companies. One proceeding before Judge Paul L. Friedman is multi-district litigation that was originally brought before the courts as a class action lawsuit but now consists of seven lawsuits occurring on a non-class basis after a federal court determined last year that the proceeding couldn't act as a class action suit. The other proceeding consists of approximately 85 lawsuits filed after class action was denied. Those lawsuits have been consolidated and are under Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell. Companies in this proceeding range from steelmakers such as AK Steel and power companies such as Georgia Power, to food products producers such as Smucker and automakers such as Toyota. In filings in April and May, the shippers allege that the four railroads are presenting arguments to the courts that seek immunity from antitrust liability. The shippers categorize the railroads' latest actions as using a narrow statute to protect their conduct from antitrust scrutiny, which they believe is an action that puts the railroads above antitrust laws, according to a source familiar with the matter. Specifically, the shippers are countering the railroads' argument that the railroads' communications in the early 2000s were part of conversations on interline rates. Statutory subsections of the Staggers Act, which deregulated the rail industry in 1980, were enacted to provide only narrow protections for specific actions and agreements between interline partners as to a shared movement or rate, which is a far cry from what the evidence shows here, said a May 7 filing from shippers to Judge Friedman. The shippers say that the railroads' latest argument has great implications not just for the proceedings but also for the logistics and supply chain generally because it would give the railroads permission to talk to each other about rail rates, thus circumventing the competition that the railroads are supposed to have with each other, according to the source. It could also provide precedent for other logistics and transportation companies to communicate with each other about rates. Should the railroads prevail, it could result in higher prices because the railroads can agree to not undercut each other on price, the source said. It could also result in a deterioration of service since companies wouldn't feel compelled to compete with each other on price. The courts have asked the Federal Trade Commission, the Surface Transportation Board and the U.S. Department of Justice to weigh in on the proceedings in July. The courts have scheduled a hearing on these proceedings for August 26."
2020-06-02,Projects At Savannah And Charleston Ports Make Progress,"Southeastern U.S. ports are expanding capacity to handle larger container vessels and/or increased rail traffic. Here are some recent updates at the ports of Savannah and Charleston: Mason Mega Rail Milestone Enables Rail Capacity Expansion The Port of Savannah is poised to expand service and rail capacity as the Mason Mega Rail project meets a production milestone. Nine of 18 working tracks have started operations at the project at the Port of Savannah, with two rail-mounted gantry cranes to be commissioned in June. These tracks will make moving containers from trains to trucks more efficient, according to the Georgia Ports Authority (GPA). At the Port of Savannah, we are working to improve the efficiency of the American supply chain and move goods to market even faster, said GPA Executive Director Griff Lynch. These efforts are strengthening our logistics network at a time when the nation needs it most. The project has been underway for more than four years and was designed to increase the port's reach in the U.S. southeastern and midwestern markets. About 56,000 feet of the total 129,000 feet of track has been installed so far. The Port of Savannah has access to CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) railroads. GPA said the Mason Mega Rail Terminal will double GPA's rail capacity to 1 million container lifts annually and enable the handling of 2 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). The U.S. Maritime Administration provided some grant money to the project. The Mason Mega Rail Terminal is an incredible example of the federal government and the port authority working together to keep America's commerce moving ahead, said GPA Board Chairman Will McKnight. Even during this [COVID-19] crisis, the disciplined effort involved has been a testament to the vital importance we all place on this nationally significant project. Savannah's import and export containers over the last five years. (SONAR: IMPTEU.USSAV, EXPTEU.USSAV) GPA also said a new overpass on State Road 25 is nearing completion. The overpass, which is expected to open in August, will carry road traffic over eight tracks linking the current Chatham Yard on the south side of the Garden City Terminal with the Mason Mega Rail site to the northwest, GPA said. Earlier this year, GPA leaders laid out plans to double Savannah's capacity to more than 9 million TEUs by 2030. Dredging Underway At The Port Of Savannah Four dredges are occurring simultaneously in the Savannah harbor, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced on May 31. Dredging deepens the harbor, enabling larger container ships to come to the port and enter and leave the harbor during a longer tide window. The dredging is part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion project, which is approximately 62% complete. The outer harbor, a 20-mile channel extending to the Atlantic Ocean, has already been deepened to 49 feet. The inner harbor dredging is the final part of the project. Two dredges in the inner harbor will deepen the harbor to 47 feet, while two other dredges will deepen parts of the harbor to a depth of 42 feet. Federal and state funds are paying for the dredging, while the Georgia Department of Transportation and GPA serve as state sponsors. The Savannah District continues to manage the intensely complicated task of coordinating dredge actions and placement of dredged material to ensure safety, compliance with contract requirements and timeliness to reach our goal of completing this major deepening in January 2022, said Col. Daniel H. Hibner, commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Savannah District. This effort ensures the harbor will improve the ability of Savannah to meet the demands of today and tomorrow. Chemicals Producers To Build Export Hub At The Port Of Charleston Polyolefins producer Braskem (NYSE:BAK) is constructing an export hub at the Port of Charleston. The facility will provide packaging, warehousing, and export shipping services to support Braskem's U.S. polypropylene production facilities. Brasklem expects the facility to be completed by the third quarter of this year. It will have the capacity to export up to 450 million pounds of polypropylene and specialty polymers worldwide. Polypropylene can be used to make consumer products' packaging, textiles and plastic parts for the automotive industry. Warehouse provider Frontier Logistics has a five-year agreement with Braskem to construct, lease and provide services for Braskem at the Port of Charleston. The build-out of our new Global Export Hub in South Carolina allows us to leverage our feedstock-advantaged, polymer production assets in the U.S Gulf Coast, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, to best meet our international clients needs, Braskem America CEO Mark Nikolich said. With excellent access to national rail and highway networks, this important new logistics and distribution facility in the South Carolina port region significantly enhances Braskem America's international export capability. Braskem's agreement comes as a new production line in La Porte, Texas, is coming online for commercial production in the third quarter of 2020. The polymer resins boom in the Gulf Coast is bringing new cargo to the Southeast, said South Carolina Ports Authority President and CEO Jim Newsome. Braskem selected the Port of Charleston as its East Coast load port due to our market's unfettered resin export capacity, knowledge of the petrochemical industry and efficiently run port terminals. We welcome Braskem as a customer of S.C. Ports. Our strong business partnerships help to ensure S.C. Ports will continue to grow above market. The Port of Charleston is also undergoing a deepening project that's being undertaken by the South Carolina Ports Authority. The project will allow the inner harbor of Charleston to accommodate container vessels of up to 18,000 TEUs. Import and export monthly containers at Charleston over the last five years.

2020-06-08,Cristobal Still Poses Flooding Threat After Moving Inland (With Forecast Video),"Tropical Storm Cristobal crashed into the Gulf Coast over the weekend, making landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana Sunday evening. Steady winds of 50 mph lashed the coastline and pushed Gulf of Mexico water onshore. SONAR Critical Events and radar: Tropical Depression Cristobal, Monday, June 8, 2020, 10 a.m. EDT The storm surge, plus heavy rainfall, flooded roads and beaches from Louisiana to near western Florida. Some areas may remain flooded today, and sections of some highways are still closed as of this morning, including US-90. WATCH: WGNO's Chief Photographer Patrick Thomas helps a stranded car get to safety from rising flood waters in Pass Christian, Mississippi on Highway 90. @TVSpyNews @WGNOtv @ABC @GMA #TropicalStormCristobal #TropicalStorm pic.twitter.com/c8FPkQCHuc — Kenny Lopez (@KennyLopez_TV) June 8, 2020 Record daily rainfall Sunday pounded Mobile, Alabama, which received 5.56 inches, as well as Pensacola, Florida, which measured 2.78 inches of rainfall. As of 8 a.m. EDT today, Cristobal was centered near Natchez, Mississippi, having moved only around 180 miles during the 14 hours since it made landfall. Cristobal has weakened to a tropical depression with sustained winds of 35 mph. Despite weaker winds, Cristobal is still dropping heavy rainfall across the lower Mississippi Valley. As the depression trudges northward over the next few days, flooding will threaten areas in the middle and upper Mississippi valleys. Rainfall totals of 3 to 5 inches could pile up from northern Arkansas to southern Wisconsin. The National Weather Service (NWS) has issued flash flood watches from Little Rock to La Crosse. Few, if any, major disruptions in surface transportation and freight movement have been reported as a direct result of Cristobal. However, the U.S. Coast Guard restricted traffic over the weekend in and out of the Port of New Orleans, also known as Port NOLA. According to its website, the Port NOLA Container Terminal (New Orleans Terminal and Ports America) will be closed today, June 8, as well as all breakbulk terminals. Normal business operations will resume Tuesday, June 9. The New Orleans Flood Protection Authority closed the floodgates in and around New Orleans. Shipments destined to or traveling through New Orleans will be impacted. Precautionary actions have been taken to protect infrastructure, and rail equipment has been re-positioned away from low-lying areas. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) has been working with customers located in the region to identify switching needs and with interchange partners to move certain shipments over alternate interchange gateways. Ongoing updates will be provided as this storm system progresses. Rail freight on other carriers may also be delayed. Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Nick Austin."
2020-06-08,BNSF Checks For Track Damage,"U.S. freight railroads are watching how tropical depression Cristobal might affect operations as it moves inland. The storm made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, late Sunday evening and is expected to travel up the Mississippi River. Area flooding could potentially disrupt rail operations temporarily. Now that Cristobal is north of BNSF tracks in Louisiana, our maintenance-of-way crews are beginning inspections to ensure there is no damage. We are in ongoing discussions with local governments to monitor flood levels and floodgate operations, said BNSF (NYSE:BRK) spokesman Ben Wilemon. BNSF will continue to closely monitor the storm as Cristobal heads north toward Memphis and Chicago. The Florida Avenue Bridge near the Port of New Orleans (Port NOLA), located near the floodgates by Florida Avenue, is still open to rail and marine traffic, although it is closed to vehicular traffic, bicyclists and pedestrians, according to a June 7 port update at 6 p.m. CDT. Earlier today, FreightWaves reported that the Port NOLA Container Terminal (New Orleans Terminal and Ports America) would be closed today, June 8, as well as all breakbulk terminals. Normal business operations will resume Tuesday, June 9. The New Orleans Flood Protection Authority had closed some flood gates ahead of the storm, but has since reopened two of them although three other gates remain closed as of 12:30 p.m. EDT. The U.S. Coast Guard also restricted traffic coming in and out of Port NOLA on Sunday. Last Friday, June 5, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) warned of potential delays as a result of Cristobal, according to a customer update. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) said it was preparing its network in the event of potential outages. This story is developing."
2020-06-16,Class 1 Railroads To Retain Cost-Cutting Measures,"The Class I railroads are considering retaining some of the measures they implemented to scale down operations as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, according to comments some executives have made at recent industry conferences. I'm very confident that as we do add back resources, we will not add them back on a one-to-one basis, said Canadian National Railway (NYSE:CNI) Chief Financial Officer Ghislain Houle at the Deutsche Bank 11th Annual Virtual Global Industrials & Materials Summit on June 9. Houle was explaining how CN would call back furloughed employees as the North American economy rebounds and demand for rail capacity grows. Given the uncertainties of how the economy and certain sectors, such as the automotive sector, might recover, CN would be patient in bringing people back from furlough, Houle said. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Hamann made similar remarks recently. As the volumes come back, we don't expect that costs will come back at a one for one, Hamann said at the UBS Virtual Global Industrials & Transportation Conference on June 2. Some of the structural changes that Union Pacific (UP) made include rerouting some of UP's train plans so that trains aren't starting and stopping at certain terminals, Hamann said. This has improved UP's locomotive productivity, according to Hamann. UP is also continuing to invest in sidings, which will enable longer trains, she said, in addition to examining how to create efficiencies at its local nodes on a terminal-by-terminal basis. As volumes come back, … can we just build those volumes into the existing train network, into the existing trains we're running, and build that train length? Hamann said. The company also hopes to finalize the consolidation of its intermodal terminals in Chicago in the latter part of 2020, and it is looking at similar consolidation opportunities at the intermodal terminals in Houston and Los Angeles, Hamann said at the Deutsche Bank conference. The idea of making some cost cuts permanent isn't new. In April, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) executives said during their first-quarter earnings call that they could make some cuts permanent. The railroad removed excess locomotives and reduced crew starts, with expectations to cut crew starts even further, executives said. Norfolk Southern (NS) is also examining which terminals and rail yards to close, including outlying smaller yards that we can continue to live without, FreightWaves reported NS Chief Operating Officer Mike Wheeler as saying. The railroads have also said in recent weeks that the pandemic has caused companies to focus on cutting costs in a way that addresses operational efficiency. For instance, Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) said during its first-quarter earnings call in April that it had used the pandemic to implement precision scheduled railroading (PSR) in a more traditional manner, resulting in fewer train starts, which in turn pares down the number of crew members needed. Kansas City Southern (KCS) has pivoted from a customized PSR model that we built for revenue … to the traditional, old-fashioned part of PSR … of eliminating costs and eliminating trains and reducing train starts and the like. [But] that does not mean we're neglecting service, said Sameh Fahmy, executive vice president of PSR, during the company's first-quarter earnings call in April. But as the railroads consider keeping some of the operational efficiencies they've made as a result of pandemic-related cost reductions, they will also have to ensure that their certified train and engine crews will be able to return quickly should rail demand surge. They will need to have locomotive and railcar fleets stored at strategically located terminals to respond to any demand upticks as well. A number of railroads have said they've stored locomotives and railcars in locations where they can be easily retrieved should capacity demand rev up quickly.

2020-06-17,Deutsche Bank Sees Some Winners As Earnings Season Approaches,"In a report to clients, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) analyst Amit Mehrotra views the outlook for transportation equities as favorable heading into the second quarter earnings season. He said transportation demand bottomed in late April with a slow but steady recovery since. Citing recent conversations with management teams at a dozen transportation companies and a sequentially improving demand backdrop, Mehrotra initiated favorable catalyst calls on Werner Enterprises (NASDAQ:WERN), XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) and United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). The firm uses catalyst calls when an analyst has a high-conviction belief a stock will outperform or underperform the market over a time period of at least two weeks and not greater than three months. Trucking calls The catalyst call buy rating on Werner stems from Mehrotra's belief the company will report a sizable beat when it releases second quarter 2020 earnings. He raised his earnings per share (EPS) estimate $0.05 to $0.51, significantly ahead of the $0.37 consensus estimate. He believes weakness in the company's one-way truckload (TL) segment was offset by improving trends in its dedicated unit, which has guaranteed capacity commitments with retailers that have seen demand accelerate during the pandemic. Further, Mehrotra said weakness in the one-way TL market, which has less stringent contractual agreements, during April was followed by recovery in May and thus far into June. He sees the potential for modest year-over-year improvement in equipment utilization and a lower than expected decline in revenue per total mile in Werner's one-way segment during the quarter. Werner's dedicated business represents approximately 60% of its TL transportation revenue and nearly half of the company's total revenue. The near-term expectations aren't as rosy for the nation's largest TL carrier, Knight-Swift Transportation (NYSE:KNX). We're bracing for a weak 2Q from KNX…but exit rate is most important and possible reinstatement of guidance likely to support shares, said Mehrotra. He believes Knight-Swift saw an extremely weak April given Knight's spot market exposure (roughly 10%) and Swift's disproportionate retail apparel and automotive customer base. He lowered his second quarter EPS estimate $0.04 to $0.32, a penny under consensus, and noted potential downside risk to the revised number. However, Mehrotra is more focused on how trends progressed through the end of the quarter versus the overall headline number. He thinks positive commentary regarding the exit rate of the quarter and reinstatement of the company's earnings guidance, which he expects to reveal a big second half rebound could buoy the shares. He maintained his buy rating on Knight-Swift's shares, pointing to improving demand and the expectation that TL capacity will continue to come out of the market. On the logistics and less-than-truckload (LTL) fronts, he's positive on XPO and Saia (NASDAQ:SAIA). He expects XPO to meet or slightly exceed consensus in the quarter. He views the adoption of ecommerce solutions by retailers as beneficial to XPO's growth outlook. He sees the company's logistics unit as a beneficiary of the growing need for ecommerce fulfillment centers, noting the segment's warehouse scale and expertise in automation. Mehrotra's expecting a big second quarter from Saia with EPS of $0.94 compared to the consensus estimate of $0.86. He believes the company's cost initiatives during the pandemic will help offset the likely revenue declines the carrier reported during its mid-quarter update. Saia has cut workforce hours by 16% and implemented a shared sacrifice structure, meaning hourly employees rotate their time off. This has been done to maximize hours per employee and minimize furloughs, allowing it to be nimble and bring employees back quickly as demand turns. The company also has a large linehaul optimization program in the works. He maintained his buy rating on the carrier. UPS and Norfolk Southern Mehrotra made a couple of other near-term calls in the earnings preview report. He implemented a catalyst call buy rating on UPS based on the expectation of a more than 20% earnings beat during the second quarter, hence his $1.30 EPS estimate compared to consensus of $1.06. He believes investors are overly (albeit understandably) negative on the freight mix shift from B2B to B2C during the pandemic. He believes weights per package and shipping distances increased sequentially in the second quarter as lockdown mandates eased. He also believes the company has become accustomed to the higher level of demand that has become the new norm and that new CEO Carol Tomé will bring a renewed focus to improving financial returns. Mehrotra initiated a catalyst call sell on Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) based on his expectation for second quarter EPS to decline 55% year-over-year. He's forecasting a 1,000-basis-point decline in the railroad's operating ratio on a 30% decline in revenue with operating expenses declining only 20%. Mehrotra believes the railroads will see revenue decline 22% on average with earnings down 33% in the second quarter. He expects Norfolk Southern to report the worst trends out of the railroads. His EPS estimate of $1.24 sits well below the consensus estimate of $1.62. In total, Mehrotra made very modest EPS changes to the transportation companies he follows. 2020 forecasts were lowered 2% on average and 2021 numbers were cut only 1%. Shares of WERN (+2.3%), XPO (+3.4%) and UPS (+2.5%) were all higher in midday trading. Shares of NSC (-0.1%) are off slightly on the day."
2020-06-19,Employee Headcount at US Class 1 Operations Tumbles 17% in May,"Rail employment in the U.S. Class I operations fell below 120,000 workers in May, reaching a new low as the railroads trimmed their workforce levels to match the steep declines in rail volumes. May's overall headcount among the U.S.operations of the Class I railroads totaled 118,880, a 16.9% drop from May 2019 and a nearly 4.5% decline from April 2020, according to freight rail data submitted to the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The total is the lowest since at least January 2012, which is the earliest date that FreightWaves has data available. Of May's total, headcount levels within the train and engine crew category, which tends to be more sensitive to demand for freight rail service, totaled 43,660, a whopping 25.7% decrease from 60,256 in May 2019 and a 10.3% decline from April 2020. Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics also show the precipitous drop in rail headcount. The totals in the SONAR chart below reflect rail headcount for both freight and passenger rail. U.S. rail headcount levels for passenger and freight rail over the past year. The data is from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. (SONAR) The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the headcount declines, with sheltering-in-place mandates in April and May slashing rail volumes as citizens stayed at home. As a result, the Class I railroads sought to scale down operations to match lower demand through actions such as implementing fewer train starts and temporarily shutting down facilities with lower traffic. Although rail volumes appear to have started to recover in recent weeks, a number of the railroads are mulling over to what degree they resume rail operations, particularly for facilities where traffic might've been historically lighter or where there might be perceived inefficiencies. Should the railroads decide to keep some aspect of their pared-down operations, it could alter headcount levels even further in 2020. Additionally, the pace of how the Class I railroads call back furloughed employees is also likely to affect headcount totals over the coming year. The uncertainty of how much further freight rail headcount levels could fall comes as some railroads recently announced plans to reorganize their operations partly because of precision scheduled railroading and also because the drop in rail volumes accelerated plans to curtail operations at some locations. For instance, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) said last week that it was folding its safety and facilities groups into the operations group later this summer – concurrent with the retirement of the head of those groups. The reorganization comes as CSX terminated 86 employees, each of whom has been offered a severance package and other support to help with their transition, according to the company. Last week CSX announced the realignment of responsibilities to better reflect our business needs and to be more productive and efficient. The changes followed a careful review of our management organization that considered what work we should be focused on and whether that work resides in the right place in the organization, CSX said. The synergies achieved through these realignments unfortunately resulted in the reduction of some management positions across the company. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) also said last week it would furlough some employees as a result of idling the Bellevue (Ohio) hump yard and transitioning to flat switching there. Norfolk Southern (NS) said the idling of the yard and the new focus on flat switching will allow for greater efficiencies and customer service as NS rolls out its strategic operations plans. The business disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic also accelerated the need to compensate for lower car volumes, NS said. (Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh)"
2020-07-02,June Rail Traffic Sees Recovery 'Accelerate',"U.S. railroads' total rail traffic was 14.3% lower year-over-year at 1,799,189 originations in the month of June according to the Association of American Railroads (AAR). Total carloads declined 22.4% year-over-year with intermodal container and trailer traffic moving only 6.6% lower. June was a month in which the slow recovery process that began in early May, began to accelerate. By the end of June, freight loadings had improved by about 60,000 carload and intermodal units weekly over where they had been in late April, said AAR Senior Vice President John T. Gray. Coal carloads were off more than 30% year-over-year in the month but auto shipments bounced back as production came online. After recording record lows in early May, coal finally stabilized at about 50,000 carloads per week by the end of June, continued Gray. Additionally, the reopening of automotive plants that began in early June has regrown that business from as little as 2,000 weekly loads to over 13,000 by the end of the month. Week 26 For the week ended June 27, week 26, total U.S. rail traffic fell 13.8% year-over-year, snapping a six-week streak of the year-over-year declines getting smaller. Last week, total U.S. rail traffic declined 12.9% year-over-year. Week 26 U.S. intermodal traffic was only 5.1% lower than the prior-year period. Total carloads excluding intermodal traffic fell 22.9%. The largest year-over-year declines were recorded in metallic ores and metals (-36.9%), coal (-35.1%), motor vehicles and parts (-27.2%), non-metallic minerals (-22.2%) and petroleum and petroleum products (-21.5%). The Canadian railroads reported total traffic declines of 15.1% year-over-year in week 26 with intermodal traffic down 8.8%. While all of these results are encouraging they will be much more robust if the current trend continues in the weeks following the July 4th holiday, said Gray. At the halfway point of 2020, U.S. carloads are 15.9% lower year-to-date compared to the first half of 2019. Total traffic is down 13.2% year-over-year with intermodal traffic off 10.6%. Total U.S. Carloads (SONAR: RTOTC.USA) Second quarter carloads at the publicly traded Class I railroads Carloads at the publicly traded Class I railroads lost momentum in the last full week of the quarter. With most of second quarter 2020 in the books, COVID-19-related demand degradation across all carload types was evident in the period. The three publicly traded U.S. railroads saw the largest year-over-year declines in auto and coal. Automotive carloads were down roughly 70% year-over-year at CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) as vehicle production ceased in late-March, not resuming until mid-May. Secular headwinds for coal demand kept carloads depressed as well, with declines ranging from down 56% year-over-year at Norfolk Southern to down 26% at Union Pacific. Quarter-to-date, second quarter carloads are down 20% year-over-year at CSX, down 26% at Norfolk Southern down, down 20% at Union Pacific and down 22% at Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU). The Canadian railroads fared better in the second quarter with Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI) down 16% year-over-year and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE:CP) down 12%. Similar headwinds related to the pandemic persisted at the Canadian railroads as broad-based declines were seen across all carload types. Agricultural carloads fared the best, up 4% at Canadian Pacific and down 2% at CN. Second quarter intermodal traffic was off in the low double-digit to low-20% range year-over-year for the U.S. railroads and KSU and only off in the mid- to high-single-digit range for the Canadian railroads.

2020-07-09,Labor Union Presses Railroads On Additional Coronavirus Measures,"The Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division (BMWED), a U.S. rail labor union affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, wants the freight railroads to privately mandate the testing and tracing of the COVID-19 virus among employees after the recent deaths of several members. The pandemic is not slowing nationally. Numbers are rising and the death toll is increasing. We understand that train service must continue. We remain willing — as always — to work to that goal, BMWED said. But, we will not be sacrificial pawns to railroads who resist implementing screening and tracing procedures that would greatly help control COVID-19 spread. We are not going to continue to have our members die. The group sent letters last week to the heads of the seven Class I railroads, pressing the executives to consider implementing stricter measures that would ensure that sick workers aren't on the job. These measures include prescreening tools such as temperature checking and symptom assessments, contact tracing, quarantines of employees who were exposed to infected co-workers, and regular testing of employees. The letters come after four BMWED members have died from the coronavirus. The group didn't say where the members worked. BMWED said it sent similar letters to Amtrak and the Metra commuter railroads in June. The safety and well-being of railroad workers is a mutual interest between the Railroad and the BMWED. Should you desire the BMWED's leadership is ready to meet immediately to work collaboratively. … The BMWED members will continue to show up for America and perform this essential service. In the same way, the railroad needs to start showing up for the workers and the public by ensuring that they take all necessary steps and protocols to protect them from this life-threatening disease, said BMWED President Freddie N. Simpson in letters to the railroads. The letter also included a 13-page white paper on suggested federal guidelines that the railroads could consider. The railroads' responses The railroads and the unions have conducted conference calls daily on best practices, according to the Association of American Railroads. Individual railroad companies also said they have implemented safety protocols. Kansas City Southern Since March 2020, [Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU)] KCS has and continues to follow appropriate guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention, also known as CDC] and the Mexican government for the safety and well-being of essential railroad workers. Accordingly, many of the requests made in the BMWED's letter are consistent with practices already in place at KCS. We continue to engage in open dialogue with union representation, KCS told FreightWaves. Union Pacific Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) said, We continue to follow CDC recommendations and are taking steps to keep employees safe and healthy. Many of the things referenced in the letter have been in place since the start of the pandemic. We also continue to have an open dialog with our union representatives. BNSF BNSF Railway Company responded, From the outset of the pandemic, we've had two main objectives: Protect the health of our employees and keep trains running. As the situation and environment around us has evolved, we have continued to evolve with it. We've grounded all of our decisions in CDC guidance and made adjustments to our policies and protocols to protect the health of our employees and the integrity of our operations. BNSF continued, We acted quickly to implement the necessary precautions to protect health and safety including additional cleaning protocols and sufficient cleaning supplies, requiring face coverings where social distancing isn't possible and response protocols for employees testing positive that not only protect the health of the employee but also those employees who may have been close contacts. This includes quarantine periods and self-assessment before returning to work in consult with our medical team. BNSF concluded, Frequent testing is essential to controlling the spread of COVID-19 and we have diligently worked to secure testing access for our employees in the 28 states in which BNSF operates. CSX CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) said, CSX railroaders have continued to ensure essential goods are getting to American consumers, and the company has followed all CDC recommendations and preventative measures since the start of the pandemic. We provide masks, gloves and cleaning supplies to all employees and have significantly increased sanitation of high-touch, high-traffic areas across our network. We are closely monitoring the virus and remain in constant communication with our employees, union representatives, customers, and vendors. Norfolk Southern Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) responded, Ensuring every Norfolk Southern employee goes home safe every night is a responsibility we always take seriously. Well before COVID-19 evolved into a global pandemic, we were responsive, flexible and transparent. We launched our Pandemic Taskforce, acted quickly based on CDC guidelines and took extensive measures to keep employees safe. We have implemented physical distancing, required the use of face coverings when physical distancing is not possible, and established rigorous cleaning protocols. NS continued, When we learn of an employee who has been diagnosed with COVID-19, we conduct contact tracing, alert employees potentially exposed and require them to quarantine as necessary. We have a hotline for employees to notify us of any health or safety concerns so we can address them. All of these measures are communicated as part of open dialogue with our employee unions, and remain in place as we continue to monitor cases of COVID-19 to protect the health of our employees, their families and people in the communities we serve. CN Canadian National Railway Company (NYSE:CNI) said it deployed a multiphase pandemic plan in March that included measures such as increasing social distancing, requiring self-isolation for employees exhibiting symptoms, and conducting amplified cleaning regimens on trains and in terminals, bunkhouses and offices, among other measures. CN is a responsible global corporation with over 25,000 employees, and we are taking all necessary steps to protect our employees, the communities in which we operate and our customers, vendors and partners and their employees, in response to the unprecedented challenges associated with the coronavirus (COVID-19), CN said. CN also said its staff medical team and occupational health department are playing a pivotal role in our pandemic planning. They are fully aligned and take direction from the World Health Organization, as well as provincial, state and federal authorities as required. They are also a member of the Association of American Railroad Health Committee. Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.

2020-07-16,US Rail Volumes Still Under Pressure,"U.S. weekly rail traffic is still facing double-digit percentage declines, with carloads once again down by over 20% since the same period in 2019. U.S. rail volumes on a weekly basis totaled 449,092 carloads and intermodal units for the week ending July 11, according to the Association of American Railroads. This is a 14.9% decline compared with the same period in 2019. Of that total, weekly U.S. carloads were down 22.7% to 201,703, while U.S. intermodal units totaled 247,389 containers and trailers, which is a 7.4% decline compared with a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, U.S. rail traffic was off by 12.9%, at 12.6 million carloads and intermodal units. U.S. rail carloads (blue: RTOTC.USA), intermodal trailers (orange: RTOIT.CLASSI) and containers (green: RTOIC.CLASSI) over the past year. (FreightWaves SONAR) Second verse, same as the first? Earnings season for the Class I railroads kicks off on July 17, with Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) reporting its second-quarter earnings results. Next week, all of the other publicly traded Class Is except Norfolk Southern Corpoation (NYSE:NSC), as well as some rail equipment manufacturers, will be releasing their second-quarter results. With North American rail volumes down by double-digit percentages in the second quarter because of the coronavirus pandemic, one of the main focuses of the earnings calls may be how the railroads managed to cut costs in the second quarter to manage the dips in revenue. But another question could be how the railroads view the second half of the year, especially as trade uncertainties with China continue to loom and the U.S. is still coping with COVID-19 outbreaks in certain regions. This is not a traditional recession. We cannot look at it that way. This is a pandemic where we had a shutdown, we then are in a quarantine phase and then we'll be looking at the restart, said Eric Starks, president and CEO of FTR Transportation Intelligence, a consulting firm, Starks made those comments on a June 16 webinar that gave a quarterly outlook on the U.S. railcar sector. A number of factors weigh into railcar demand, including the rate of U.S. industrial production, which can be garnered through data from the Federal Reserve, and the seasonality of freight shipping, according to Starks. But what can be gleaned from existing data is that it will take several quarters for U.S. railcar utilization to reach pre-pandemic levels. Carloads in April and May were so low because of the pandemic. Furthermore, some key sectors are still facing headwinds, which in turn leads to potentially less carload utilization. FTR estimated last month that railcar utilization was about 51.8% in the second quarter, which is significantly lower than past quarters, according to Starks. This is basically saying, for every car used, you have a car parked. That's just tremendous, Starks said last month. Indeed, since the webinar's airing last month, railcar utilization has weakened further to an all-time low of below 50%. The freight market for carloads is stabilizing, but is failing to show growth, Todd Tranausky, vice president of rail and intermodal for FTR, told Freightwaves. What complicates the picture is that some sectors face more headwinds than others, which translates into some railcar markets being more under pressure than others. For instance, the market for small cube covered hoppers has been decimated amid low energy prices and falling demand for certain types of sand shipments, Tranausky said last month. Earlier this week, FreightWaves reported that Hi-Crush filed for bankruptcy amid slumping energy prices. Hi-Crush is a supplier of frac sand. However, the extended closure of the Dakota Access Pipeline could help some incremental crude carloads move, although it is unlikely to move the needle, especially at current crude prices, Tranausky told FreightWaves on July 16. Meanwhile, the market for medium-sized covered hoppers is facing trade-related uncertainties because a large portion of the U.S. grain market is export-bound. And the market for jumbo-covered hoppers and pellet cars is also vulnerable because anticipated Gulf Coast capacity expansions for plastics production in 2023-2025 are under threat from lower plastics demand globally, Tranausky said last month. The freight demand that we've seen come out of the market during the pandemic is going to be slow to come back into the market, and that means it's going to reverberate through the rail equipment space for years to come, Tranausky said in June. This is not going to be a one quarter, two quarter, or even a one year phenomenon. You're going to feel the effects of this for some time. Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.

2020-07-16,Feds: Railroads' Rate Discussions Can Be Evidence In Price-Fixing Lawsuits,"Class I railroads' discussions about setting local and interline rates can be included as evidence in dozens of shippers' lawsuits over price fixing in the 2000s, various federal agencies have concluded. Attorneys with the U.S. Department of Justice, speaking on behalf of itself, the Federal Trade Commission, the Surface Transportation Board and the U.S. Department of Transportation, determined that discussions or agreements by the Class I carriers on setting local or interline rates generally can be admissible in court proceedings, according to a Monday amicus brief in a proceeding before Judge Paul L. Friedman with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The discussions and agreements apply to both regulated and unregulated rail traffic cases. The U.S. code that governs what rail-related discussions or agreements are exempt from U.S. antitrust laws does protect discussions or agreements that deal with interline traffic executed by rail carriers on a specific basis, the attorneys said. The court had asked the federal agencies to weigh in on the proceedings. The federal agencies' interpretation of U.S. laws could potentially benefit the dozens of shippers who have filed lawsuits against four U.S. Class I carriers: CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) and BNSF Railway Company (NYSE:BRK). The lawsuits allege that between 2003 and 2008, the railroads applied fuel surcharges on rail rates that weren't related to fuel. The shippers argue that the purpose of the fuel surcharges and the fuel cost recovery program was to garner additional revenue. Some shippers were concerned earlier this year that the railroads' argument that certain discussions on interline rates are immune from antitrust liability could open the door to loosening antitrust laws. But Congress made clear before the statute's enactment, and the executive branch confirmed soon afterwards, that [the U.S. Code] excludes only lawful discussions or agreements among rail carriers about interline traffic that they directly handle, the attorneys said in the Monday filing. Nothing in the statute or its history suggests that it bars circumstantial evidence where the context of the communication shows that carriers fixed rates for local or interline shipments in which they did not participate — and which potentially competed against service over their own lines. This and a similar proceeding have a joint hearing slated for Aug. 26. Over 90 lawsuits are part of the two proceedings, representing shippers and companies ranging from steel companies such as AK Steel and power companies such as Georgia Power, to food products producers such as Smucker and automakers such as Toyota.

2020-07-29,Pandemic Puts Pressure On Norfolk Southern,"Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) net profits for the second quarter slipped 46% to $392 million, or $1.53 in diluted earnings per share, compared with $722 million, or $2.70 in diluted earnings per share, in the second quarter of 2019. A 26% decline in rail volumes contributed to the drop in profits year-over-year. Operating revenues fell 29% to $2.1 billion. Meanwhile, operating expenses slipped 21% to $1.5 billion on lower expenses for fuel, compensation and benefits and purchased services. Income from railway operations was $610 million, a 43% drop from nearly $1.07 billion in the second quarter of 2019. The profit decline in the second quarter comes as other Class I railroads also reported decreases in second-quarter net income because of adverse economic conditions exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. (Norfolk Southern) The steepest revenue declines in the second quarter came from automotive and coal. (Norfolk Southern) But service metrics improved in the second quarter, with train speeds increasing 12% to 24.6 miles per hour and terminal dwell falling 1% to 18.1 hours. Norfolk Southern's (NS) operating ratio was 70.7% for the quarter, compared with 63.6% in the same period last year. Operating ratio, which is a company's expenses as a percentage of its revenue, can be an indicator of the financial performance of a company. A lower percentage implies improved financial performance. In a period when working safely and delivering for our customers was abruptly redefined, our employees responded by protecting each other and innovating to serve rapidly evolving freight demand. Underscoring our commitment to shareholder value, we forged ahead with our ongoing transformation by further reducing our hump yard footprint, achieving fuel efficiency gains, and increasing train size. These are astounding achievements while managing the unprecedented economic disruption and public health crisis, said NS President and CEO Jim Squires. We are mobilized and driven to meet the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and we will continue to create collaborative change and relentlessly pursue increased productivity as a leading supply chain partner throughout the economic recovery and beyond.

2020-07-30,Norfolk Southern Seeks To Boost Its Intermodal Market Share,"Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) is planning to add more intermodal service products in the Southern U.S. as a way to take volume away from the trucking market, executives said during the company's second-quarter earnings call on Wednesday, July 29. Those products, which could be launched as early as the third quarter of this year, include products between the U.S. Southwest and the U.S. Southeast, as well as between the U.S. Southeast to the U.S. Northeast, said NS Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw. They are a new level of product that is not out there in the marketplace right now, or had not been. We're confident that…it's going to help us grow moving forward, Shaw said. Railroad executives said NS is seeking to take advantage of higher spot truck prices and tight truck markets in some U.S. regions. NS' July volumes are a pretty strong sequential improvement over June, and June was a month that experienced high retail spending and rising truck rates and truck tonnage, Shaw said. Although export activity has been slow in July, there is a heavy demand for imports because of low inventories, Shaw said. Since more goods are being sent to West Coast ports instead of East Coast ports, that has created some transloads into 53-foot containers, which in turn opened up some domestic intermodal opportunities, he said. NS expects volumes to increase sequentially in the second half of 2020 after the COVID-19 pandemic battered rail volumes in April and May. However, the rate of increase is unclear because of political and economic uncertainties. The severity and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic is also another uncertainty. The risks that we see going forward are increasing cases of COVID-19 and the unsettled situation with fiscal policy and the stimulus, and the impact that that could potentially have on fourth quarter volume and revenue, Shaw said. NS is still looking to reduce terminal footprint NS' TOP21, its version of precision scheduled railroading, coupled with the impacts of COVID-19 this spring, contributed to NS' decision to shed assets to make the company leaner. That included idling two large hump yards at the Linwood terminal in North Carolina and Bellevue at Ohio, in addition to idling two other hump yards over the past year. NS also closed one of two locomotive heavy repair shops. The second quarter saw an unprecedented amount of operating change, as we ceased hump operations at two yards and responded to major volume shifts with a keen eye, towards making many of our crew start reductions permanent, said NS Chief Operating Officer Mike Wheeler. He also said NS reduced the headcount levels of its train and engine staff and cut the number of active locomotives on its network to match network capacity needs with demand. As volumes rebound, NS will continue to seek ways to reduce its terminal footprint. We're not letting off the gas. We've got several things we continue to look at that are in the hopper, and we'll roll out as appropriate based on the volumes in the business, Wheeler said. But like I've said before, we are going to continue to push ourselves to find ways to reduce our structural costs out there and the terminals that we can do without, while still providing service products that we've committed to. So, we still have things we're working on and you'll see those roll out in the future. NS' second-quarter financial results, go here. Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.

2020-07-31,"Intermodal Growth Here To Stay, Says Hub Group","On its Thursday evening earnings call with analysts, management from intermodal marketing company Hub Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:HUBG) said several customers are approaching them to talk about peak season capacity needs. A number of customers have indicated the recent strength in demand in the West will likely continue through peak season and possibly November as inventories remain depleted and restocking continues. Management said intermodal volumes were up 5% year-over-year in June and 8% in July, significantly better than the mid-teen percentage declines seen in April and May. They expect volumes to be up in the high-single-digit range year-over-year for the rest of 2020. The OakBrook, Illinois-based company reported second-quarter 2020 earnings per share of 39 cents, well ahead of the 24-cents-per-share consensus estimate. The result included 21 cents per share, or $7 million, in donation, consulting and severance expenses. The company reported earnings per share of 87 cents in the year-ago quarter. We were pleased to see business conditions improve throughout the quarter, with nearly all of our customers resuming their shipping activity by the end of the quarter, said Chairman and CEO Dave Yeager in the company's press release. Hub Group's key performance indicators Intermodal turning positive During the second quarter, intermodal revenue declined 15% year-over-year to $461 million as volumes declined 8%. During the height of the pandemic, more than 20% of Hub Group's customers were closed. Now approximately 90% of its customers are operational. Local-West shipments were down 3%, transcontinental loads were down 7% and volumes in the East declined 11% during the quarter. By comparison, U.S. intermodal traffic on the Class I railroads was 13% lower year-over-year in the second quarter. Hub Group's primary rail partners Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) reported intermodal traffic declines of 16% and 17%, respectively. Demand for intermodal has been soft to say the least. However, truck markets have tightened and diesel prices appear to have bottomed for the recent cycle. This has resulted in smaller declines in intermodal traffic on the rails in recent weeks. Weekly year-over-year declines have been in the mid-single-digit range recently, down only 2.4% in the most recent week, compared to low-teen percentage declines throughout May. Further, intermodal spot rates, not applicable for most companies as they work off of contract rates, have been moving higher since late May. Rates in all domestic lanes are up more than 20% since the end of May. Key lanes like Los Angeles-Chicago and Los Angeles-Dallas saw rates nearly double over the same time period before contracting in the latest week. Those lanes are still up 60% in the past two months. Rates in the East remain low as lengths of haul are shorter and affordable truck capacity remains available. A firming in intermodal spot markets, along with tightening TL capacity, is a shot in the arm for contractual intermodal negotiations. Intermodal rates – (SONAR: INTRM.USA) Addressing intermodal rates, management said 71% of 2020's bids have been completed, resulting in contractual rate increases in the low-single-digit range. Pressed on the 2021 bid season, management said mid-single-digit rate increases are possible if the current market tightness continues. Intermodal gross margin declined 220 basis points in the second quarter due to softer volume and price, an unfavorable freight mix, and increased rail costs. Management believes gross margins will decline sequentially in the second half of the year as rail costs continue to increase. No guidance The company didn't reinstate its previously withdrawn guidance. However, management said they remain on track to achieve $40 million in annualized cost savings by the end of the year, with approximately $20 million in total savings being realized in 2020. Non-driver headcount is down 14% and the company continues to make progress on its utilization and optimization improvements on its drayage and dedicated assets. Further, most of the donation, consulting and severance expenses have been completed. Cash and capex Hub Group generated $71 million in net cash from operations during the second quarter, with an ending cash balance of $203 million after repayment of $100 million on its revolver. The company plans to record $65 million to $75 million in capital expenditures (capex) for the remainder of 2020. This includes the purchase of containers, tractors and trailers, as well as IT investments. The company announced it has increased container purchases by 3,500 units and ordered more than 200 tractors to support the expected growth in the back half of the year. Hub Group recorded capex of $24 million in the second quarter, taking first-half 2020 capex to $49 million. The increased guidance moves expected full-year capex to a range of $114 million to $124 million, in line with the original plan when the year began. However, that plan included $35 million in capital allocation for the construction of a new office building on the Oak Brook campus, which was previously paused at the beginning of the pandemic. Management said they will incur $20 million in construction expense on the project in 2020. They remain uncertain on what to do with the property and said all options — selling, renting and occupying — remain on the table. The decision will likely hinge on future workplace mandates versus their employees' work-from-home capabilities. The estimated completion time for the project is six months. Logistics, brokerage and dedicated Logistics revenue declined 15% year-over-year to $164 million, partially offset by continued growth from the CaseStack acquisition. Gross margin improved 190 basis points due to the implementation of new, higher-margin business. Truck brokerage reported a 19% year-over-year revenue decline to $87 million as loads declined 12%. Gross margin improved 100 basis points from technology improvements and increased usage of the company's carrier network. Dedicated revenue was down 12% year-over-year to $68 million as the company exited some accounts. Gross margin increased 200 basis points. Management expects dedicated revenue to be down in the back half of the year. Click for more FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden.

2020-08-07,"Coal, Energy Drive Down US Rail Traffic In July","Systemic declines for coal plus a sluggish energy market contributed to an almost 18% decline in U.S. carloads in July, according to the Association of American Railroads (AAR). U.S. carload volumes in July totaled 1.04 million, down 17.6% from July 2019, while intermodal volumes slipped 1.4% to nearly 1.3 million containers and trailers. Total U.S. traffic was 2.34 million carloads and intermodal units, a 9.3% drop from July 2019. The old saying, ‘You have to play the hand you're dealt' applies to railroads, said AAR Senior Vice President John T. Gray. Rail traffic, like the overall economy, is generally trending in the right direction, but progress is slow. There's a long way to go before it's back to normal; and both week-to-week improvements and setbacks in individual commodities are to be expected. Coal and other energy-related rail commodities continue to struggle more than most, while intermodal is closer than any other rail traffic category to pre-pandemic levels. Of July's volumes, coal slipped 28.7% or 110,225 carloads; crushed stone, sand and gravel fell 24.8% or 29,547 carloads; and metallic ores dropped 63.7% or 21,942 carloads. Excluding coal, U.S. carloads in July were down by 12.7%, or 112,112 carloads. Meanwhile, on a weekly basis, U.S. carloads volumes remained under pressure, falling 18.3% to 217,691 carloads for the week ending August 1. But intermodal traffic was only 1.8% lower to 270,277 intermodal units. Overall U.S. rail traffic slipped 9.9% to 487,968 carloads and intermodal units. However, on a weekly sequential basis, carloads were up by 1.2% and intermodal units were up by 1.5%. U.S. carloads (in blue: RTOTC.USA) and intermodal trailers (orange: RTOIT.CLASSI) and containers (green: RTOIC.CLASSI) over the past year. Retail Trade Group Eyes Economic Data Pointing To A Flattening Recovery Freight rail volumes have bounced back from their lows in April and May, but the publicly traded Class I railroads, plus industry stakeholders, are cautious about how volumes will fare in the second half of the year because of the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is uncertain. The railroads have said that volumes will rebound in the back half of the year, but the pace of the rebound and the strength of it is unclear. The risks that we see going forward are increasing cases of COVID-19 and the unsettled situation with fiscal policy and the stimulus, and the impact that could potentially have on fourth-quarter volume and revenue, said Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw during his company's second-quarter earnings call last week. Rail stakeholders are also questioning how market conditions will look like in the second half of this year given the uncertainty of whether the coronavirus pandemic will force another lockdown in certain areas. Optimism about the economy and retail spending is being tested daily with the spread of the coronavirus, National Retail Federation (NRF) Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said on August 4 as part of NRF's release of its monthly economic review. Big questions are looming, and we are all grappling to discern what incoming data is telling us about the health of the economy and consumers. Depending on the data selected, the answers are not entirely clear. He continued, A key question is whether the pace of growth and momentum will carry forward over the next few months. Based on quarterly and monthly data, the U.S. economic recovery continues despite elevated COVID-19 cases. But in examining weekly data, the pace of improvement appears to be slowing. Could it be that we are at or heading back to the same spot we were at two months ago? Although monthly indicators show the U.S. economy improving in May and June, July's weekly figures seem to show a flattening recovery, NRF said. For instance, NRF pointed to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Weekly Economic Index, which slipped from -6.65% on July 18 to -7.24% as of July 25 amid a decrease in retail sales. Meanwhile, for the week of July 18, weekly initial unemployment claims were up by 100,000 on a weekly basis, reversing a steady decline in claims since a peak of 6.9 million the last week of March, NRF said. Many of the weekly reports now suggest that the economy is moving sideways, Kleinhenz said. Time will tell, but the bottom line is that the economy is far from being out of the woods. The question is whether it is re-entering the woods. IANA: Pandemic Put Pressure On Intermodal Volumes In Q2 Meanwhile, the Intermodal Association of North America (IANA) confirmed last week that second-quarter North American intermodal volumes fell by double-digit percentage points amid the coronavirus pandemic. Lower diesel prices also fueled increased competition from trucks. Total second-quarter intermodal volumes fell 11.9% compared with the second quarter of 2019, with international shipments slipping 15.4%, domestic containers falling 7% and trailers dropping 14%. Second quarter results showed the full impact of the economic downturn attributed to COVID-19. Slowing imports and declining diesel prices affected both international and domestic volumes, said IANA President and CEO Joni Casey. We anticipate that the second quarter drop-off should be a floor going forward. Seven of the highest-density trade corridors experienced lower traffic in the second quarter. Together, the corridors represented 60% of total intermodal volume, according to IANA. The losses were as follows: Midwest-Northwest: down 19.1% Lanes within the Southeast, down 17.6% South Central-Southwest, down 14.6% Southeast-Southwest, down 11.6% Northeast-Midwest, down 10.3% Eastern Canada-Western Canada, down 9.7% Midwest-Southwest, down 7.3% IANA also said international marketing companies' volumes slipped 8.5% in the second quarter, of which highway loads were down 4% and intermodal was down 15.2%.

2020-08-24,Class I Railroads Brace For Tropical Storms Marco And Laura,"Class I railroads with operations along the U.S. Gulf Coast are bracing for potential impacts from tropical storms Marco and Laura. The timing of the storms' approach to the Gulf Coast states is packing a one-two punch for area ports and transportation providers. Another concern is flooding as the storms travel northward. Marco is expected to make landfall Monday night, while Laura is forecast to hit on Wednesday and into Thursday. Our command center has been activated to monitor the storms with resources staged should there be impacts to the network, BNSF (NYSE:BRK) told FreightWaves. As we do with any storm, we will closely monitor train traffic, reroute as needed from impacted areas for the safety of our people and ensure our customers' freight arrives securely at its final destination. Similar actions are being undertaken at the other Class Is, including Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC), which put out an operations update earlier Monday. Precautionary actions are being taken to protect infrastructure, and rail equipment is being repositioned away from low-lying areas around Mobile, Alabama, and New Orleans, Louisiana, Norfolk Southern (NS) said, adding that customers with critical shipments should contact customer service. Norfolk Southern is working with customers located in the forecasted regions to identify switching needs and with interchange partners to move certain shipments over alternate interchange gateways. Ongoing updates will be provided as this storm system progresses. NS also said that the New Orleans Flood Protection Authority will close the last floodgate Monday after closing other floodgates in and around New Orleans on Sunday. Shipments destined to or traveling through New Orleans and Mobile will be impacted. At this time, we do not know the duration of the impact, NS said. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) also said it is monitoring the weather systems. The railroad said its intermodal terminal in Avondale, Louisiana, is closed until further notice. Union Pacific is preparing rail operations as tropical storms Marco and Laura make their way toward the Gulf Coast. We are working closely with customers as we adjust train schedules and move equipment out of low-lying areas as needed, UP said. Personnel and materials are being staged in strategic locations, ensuring rail outages are addressed once the storms pass. Crews will be able to make repairs with quick access to generators, rock ballast stockpiles, supplemental fuel and other materials needed to rebuild track infrastructure. According to a Sunday operations note, the preparations that UP has taken ahead of the storm include staging generators at strategic locations; sending ballast trains to the area, with ballast stockpiles in place at strategic locations; adding fueling stations to supplement current fuel supplies; and adding and putting on standby crews and other supporting personnel. Meanwhile, Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) said the closure of the Port of Gulfport in Mississippi has affected Kansas City Southern's (KCS) rail service in and out of the port, as well as its interchange with CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) at Gulfport. As always, the safety of our employees, customers' shipments and the communities we serve remains the priority. We are closely monitoring the storms and will notify if there are any other changes to our network or service, KCS said in a Monday operations update. FreightWaves reported earlier Monday that the U.S. Coast Guard has temporarily closed ports in Louisiana, including the Port of New Orleans, the Port of South Louisiana and the Port of Baton Rouge. Vessels may not enter or move within these ports without permission of the captain of the port, and all ship-to-shore operations must cease until further notice.

2020-08-27,Intermodal Volumes Prop Up US Rail Traffic,"U.S. intermodal traffic on a weekly basis gained 5% in the week ending Aug. 22, which in turn helped lift overall rail volumes higher. U.S. freight railroads originated 285,086 intermodal containers and trailers last week, a 5% increase from the same period in 2019, according to the Association of American Railroads. Volumes are also 2.5% higher sequentially, and last week was the third week in a row that weekly traffic was higher on a year-over-year basis. But U.S. weekly carloads are still lower compared with last year, at 229,828 carloads. That is a 12% decline from a year ago. On a sequential basis, carloads were 3.4% higher. Combined U.S. rail traffic on a weekly basis was 514,914 carloads and intermodal units, a 3.3% drop compared with the same period last year. Meanwhile, year-to-date U.S. rail volumes totaled 15.55 million carloads and intermodal units, a 11.9% decline from the same period in 2019. U.S. rail volumes over the last year, in carloads (blue: RTOTC.USA), intermodal trailers (orange: RTOIT.CLASSI) and containers (green: RTOIC.CLASSI). (SONAR) New home sales up, but Laura looms Although the U.S. is still facing some macroeconomic uncertainty because of the coronavirus pandemic, one figure that could bode well for rail volumes is the strength of single-family home sales. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Census Bureau on Tuesday reported that sales of newly built, single-family homes was up 13.9% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 901,000 units. That's the highest rate increase since 2006. According to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), the July rate is 36.3% higher than July 2019. New home sales are benefiting from the suburban shift, as prospective buyers seek out affordable markets in order to obtain more residential space. Moreover, sales are increasingly coming from homes that have not started construction, with that count up 34% year-over-year, said NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz. In contrast, sales of completed, ready-to-occupy homes are down almost 24%. These measures point to continued gains for single-family construction ahead. While a trend in higher new home sales could benefit rail volumes, Hurricane Laura, which started out as a tropical storm but has since been upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane, could disrupt the rail network in the short term. Details change every day, but as of Wednesday, the railroads said they were continuing to monitor the storm and are diverting traffic as needed. In a Wednesday operations update, Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) said it will continue to watch the progress of the storm and has staged equipment and materials in key areas to begin any necessary recovery activities as soon as it is safe to do so. In an earlier update on Wednesday, Norfolk Southern said it had resumed normal operations in the Mobile, Alabama, area. NS' service updates can be found here. BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (NYSE:BRK) said the hurricane could cause extended service outages in the area because of the forecasted storm surge as well as the potential for flooding in multiple locations, according to a Wednesday operations note. With the flood gates in and around New Orleans closed, interchange traffic with BNSF's eastern carriers has been affected and efforts are being made to re-route traffic, BNSF said. Throughout the week, BNSF has been preparing for the hurricane, including the activation of an around-the-clock Command Center to address any impacts to our network and direct recovery efforts that are needed, BNSF said.Additional resources have been staged at various locations to address track outages as quickly as possible. Our operating teams are also in communication with local, state and federal emergency personnel. BNSF's service updates can be found here. Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) noted that Lake Charles, Louisiana, and Port Arthur, Texas, went under mandatory evacuations because of Hurricane Laura in a Tuesday operations update. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) has informed us that they have begun taking the necessary precautions and therefore our routes between Beaumont and Houston will not be in service after 7 p.m. Tuesday, Kansas City Southern (KCS) said. This will impact both north and southbound cross-border service. The latest KCS update can be found here. Union Pacific (UP) confirmed that it was curtailing operations across parts of its network, according to a Tuesday operations update. The railroad was securing rail equipment at its yards and deploying additional support personnel. UP's intermodal terminal in Avondale, Louisiana, remains closed until further notice, and it also closed the Settegast and Englewood intermodal terminals in Houston on Tuesday. UP's updates can be found here. Separately, UP also said it was consolidating its intermodal operations in the Houston area this fall as part of its broader efforts to implement its version of precision scheduled railroading. At the Settegast facility, UP will continue to handle its current intermodal and manifest business and it will take on the intermodal shipments currently managed by the Englewood yard, according to a Wednesday announcement from Kenny Rocker, UP's executive vice president for marketing and sales. The Englewood facility will then have additional capacity for UP's manifest operations. The changes will simplify ramp operations, Rocker said. This shift will further improve the network fluidity in the Houston area, providing you with safer and more consistent service – a major win for all customers, Rocker said.

2020-09-25,Norfolk Southern's Debt Overview,"Over the past three months, shares of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) moved higher by 22.49%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Norfolk Southern has. Norfolk Southern's Debt Based on Norfolk Southern’s balance sheet as of July 29, 2020, long-term debt is at $12.61 billion and current debt is at $85.00 million, amounting to $12.70 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $1.14 billion in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $11.55 billion. Investors look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. Norfolk Southern has $37.96 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.33. Generally speaking, a debt-ratio more than one means that a large portion of debt is funded by assets. As the debt-ratio increases, so the does the risk of defaulting on loans, if interest rates were to increase. Different industries have different thresholds of tolerance for debt-ratios. A debt ratio of 25% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Importance Of Debt Besides equity, debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and contributes to its growth. Due to its lower financing cost compared to equity, it becomes an attractive option for executives trying to raise capital. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital."

2020-10-15,Environmental Groups Appeal Permits For LNG Export Facility In New Jersey,"Environmental groups are appealing multiple permit approvals for a project that would include the transport of liquefied natural gas (LNG) via rail for export out of a New Jersey terminal. The organizations say the rail and truck transport of LNG needs more federal regulatory oversight given its volatile nature. Delaware Riverkeeper Network and other local environmental groups are appealing permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection for the construction of an LNG terminal at the Gibbstown Logistics Center in Gibbstown, New Jersey. The terminal, which would be located off of the Delaware River, would be constructed by Energy Transport Solutions (ETS), a subsidiary of New Fortress Energy (NASDAQ:NSE). The LNG would be transported by rail or truck from a facility in Wyalusing, Pennsylvania, operated by New Fortress Energy. Construction at that facility, located in the Marcellus Shale region, has temporarily paused because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to local news sources. We look at every part of the supply chain that this project entails, and we consider every single step of it to be dangerous and untested, Delaware Riverkeeper Network Deputy Director Tracy Carluccio told FreightWaves. The groups also want the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to rule that it has jurisdiction over this project, as it does with other LNG facilities. Delaware River Partners, a subsidiary of New Fortress Energy, is seeking a declaratory order that FERC doesn't have jurisdiction over the Gibbstown project, according to local news reports. Separately, New Fortress Energy and FERC have been battling over whether New Fortress Energy needed FERC's permission to build an LNG terminal in Puerto Rico. We think it's very important that FERC does exercise its jurisdiction and be able to apply the layer of regulation that FERC has within its power because right now there really is nobody, no agency with a specific liquefied natural gas expertise or experience that has reviewed the project … and it's a huge gap in the regulatory oversight of this facility, Carluccio said. That oversight should include an examination of proposed transloading operations and how other operations at the site, such as butane loading, might interplay with LNG activities, Carluccio said. The Gibbstown property also backs into area residents' yards, she said. Neither Energy Transport Solutions nor New Fortress Energy returned requests for comment. But Energy Transport Solutions has told area news outlets that the project has gone through extensive environmental and regulatory review processes and it has received approval from multiple federal, state and local agencies. Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), whose network is within the vicinity of the LNG facility in Pennsylvania, wouldn't comment on the Gibbstown project because it's not involved in the project at this point. The railroad also said it isn't currently moving any LNG. Regardless, safety is our top priority no matter the commodity, and we always take whatever necessary measures to ensure safe operation, Norfolk Southern spokesperson Jeff DeGraff said. As debate continues on the Gibbstown project, other local approvals are still needed. The Delaware River Basin Commission (DRBC) in September decided to delay until December a decision to approve a permit that would allow for the construction of an LNG terminal at Gibbstown. The DRBC, a governmental body made up of several state representatives whose states border the Delaware River, decided at a board meeting on Sept. 10 to stay a vote on whether to approve the project. The DRBC had previously approved the project to build Dock 2 at the Gibbstown Logistics Center in March 2019, but environmental groups, including the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, appealed the approval. Although the DRBC voted to stay its decision, New Fortress Energy subsidiary and terminal operator Delaware River Partners could start conducting in-water work for the Dock 2 project because it has a Section 404/10 permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. According to the DRBC, the Gibbstown Logistics Center is a multiuse, deep-water seaport and industrial logistics center located on a portion of the former 1,630-acre DuPont Repauno facility. The project entails the construction of a wharf that will have two deep-water berths in the Delaware River. Ultimately, the project will enable the export of bulk liquid products by vessel. Environmental groups' concerns Although the environmental groups have broader concerns about hydraulic fracturing or fracking, a process that extracts natural gas from the Earth, the groups are also concerned about the scale and scope of an accident involving the transport of LNG. Since New Fortress Energy is a private company, it hasn't disclosed the potential routes it could use to transport LNG from the Pennsylvania facility to Gibbstown. But whether the material is transported by rail or by truck, it would likely pass through densely populated areas like Philadelphia. A special permit granted to Energy Transport Solutions by the U.S. DOT Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) in December 2019 allows for the transport of LNG by rail. That permit requires trains transporting 20 or more tank cars to have a two-way end-of-train device, with each car remotely monitored for pressure, location and leaks. ETS must provide training to emergency response agencies along the train route, as well as fulfill reporting requirements to PHMSA. Should the material be released in an accident, it could cause extreme freeze burns within a quarter-mile to a mile because the material is cooled to minus 260℉ prior to transport. That cooling reduces its volume, resulting in a concentrated amount in a container, according to Carluccio. But the expansion of the material following a spill is also potentially dangerous because it would result in a powerful vapor cloud with a lot of energy behind it, Carluccio said. Should something ignite the cloud, such as a cigarette lighter, it could result in a very large fire that could cover a lot of ground, she said. The groups are also concerned about the transloading of LNG that is planned to occur at Gibbstown because moving the material from one container to another increases the possibility for human error. It's really a novel approach to how a company can export and market LNG overseas because it's building an inland facility that will be the first in the nation that goes a long distance over so much volume, Carluccio said. A March 2019 risk assessment report prepared for PHMSA said the causes of train accidents usually involve issues with the track quality or equipment design, method of operation, traffic exposure, and human factors. It also noted that experts associated with the Railway Supply Institute and the Association of American Railroads and governing bodies such as the Federal Railroad Administration are studying the technical aspects of moving hazardous materials via rail. When the probability of LNG tank car derailment is understood, better decisions can be made regarding the crashworthiness, placement, and operation of rail cars and the potential consequences from an LNG release due to a derailment. Further study for modeling the probability and consequences of transporting LNG by rail and truck will help decision-makers understand public risks and make informed decisions, the report said. The report also said transporting LNG by rail could become an option for companies seeking to supplement LNG transportation via pipeline. There is evidence that a demand exists for shipping LNG by rail, and that rail shipments of LNG can be both competitive and complementary to the truck and pipeline networks. Since railroads have unique advantages and disadvantages compared to trucks, and the public safety implications are not fully developed, risk assessments provide additional insight into the shipment of LNG by rail, the report stated. Federal involvement in LNG by rail PHMSA's approval of Energy Transport Solutions' project is part of a wider plan introduced by President Donald Trump to encourage LNG exports and increase U.S. competitiveness. Trump issued an executive order in April 2019 that called for the U.S. secretary of transportation to propose a rule within 100 days treating LNG the same as other cryogenic liquids and allowing it to be transported in rail tank cars. The order also instructed the Transportation and Energy departments to assess, within 180 days, the economic effects of the inability to move sufficient quantities of LNG to states in New England and other regions. It would also make it easier for LNG export terminals to receive the necessary federal approvals, which can typically take years. Since then, Energy Transport Solutions received its permit and PHMSA issued a final rule allowing for liquefied natural gas by rail. According to PHMSA, this final rule incorporates newly designated additional safety requirements, such as an enhanced, thicker carbon steel outer tank and the remote monitoring of the pressure and location of LNG tank cars. The rule also requires a two-way end-of-train or distributed power system when a train is transporting 20 or more tank cars loaded with LNG in a continuous block, or 35 or more such tank cars of LNG anywhere in the train consist. And the rule requires railroads to conduct route risk assessments to evaluate safety and security. As PHMSA underwent the rulemaking process, House Democrats sought to prevent the rule from coming to fruition. Environmental groups and more than a dozen states plus the District of Columbia have also filed a lawsuit against PHMSA on the rule. According to Carluccio, because PHMSA's rule permitting LNG by rail was issued after New Fortress Energy received its special permit, the permit doesn't have some of the requirements of the final rule, such as requiring tank cars transporting LNG to have an extra steel jacket. Delaware Riverkeeper is part of the group suing the federal government over the rule. The dangers of LNG are attached to the properties of the material. It's not whether it's a rail car or a truck car or a ship, Carluccio said. Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.

2020-10-23,Trinity Industries Pinpoints Focus On Rail,"Railcar lessor and rail product manufacturer Trinity Industries (NYSE:TRN) will focus exclusively on servicing the rail industry as the company seeks to shore up its financial well-being. The change comes as the company abruptly ended its trucking business earlier this month. Trinity also ended a logistics business. Trinity has three goals for its new strategic framework to lower its financial breakeven point. Those goals are to optimize its railcar lease fleet, reduce the impact of cyclicality on the company and take steps to ensure the modal advantage of rail, according to Trinity President and CEO Jean Savage. This strategy will place more importance on cash flow and returns, resulting in more disciplined levels of growth through the cycle, Savage said during Trinity's third-quarter earnings call Thursday. As a result of the strategy, Trinity will be focusing on its railcar products and will seek to scale new product and service offerings. Headcount and cost reductions also occurred in the third quarter as a result of the new strategy. Year-to-date, Trinity has reduced operating and other costs by $80 million while employee headcount has been reduced by 47%. Trinity decided to exit the U.S. trucking and logistics business and outsource this business to third parties, Savage said. The fleet had serviced Trinity's former industrial businesses. Trinity incurred a small impairment charge because of this decision, she said. More employee reductions could occur into the beginning of next year, Savage said. We're evaluating our material cost and reviewing the relative spend between direct and indirect costs in order to lower our breakeven point, Savage said. We believe through various cost efforts, the rail segment margin could meaningfully improve throughout the cycle. As Trinity implements its new framework, the company expects that market conditions for rail will improve despite ongoing headwinds such the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company ses a good pipeline of inquiries for new and existing railcars, and railcar loadings in North America have rebounded in the third quarter. Trinity expects railcar deliveries to total around 11,000 for 2020. Right now, I think everyone's just cautiously optimistic that things are moving in the right direction. Three straight weeks with year-over-year improvement … [for] total rail traffic numbers [is] something we hadn't seen since the beginning of 2019, Savage said. I think this has us all thinking maybe it's going in the right direction there. And then we've had 75,000 cars come out of storage in the last quarter. So, that's also a great indicator that things might be heading up. So we may have bottomed and started the upturn. For the industry to get to the point where there is demand to replace railcars, about 85% to 87% of the U.S. fleet needs to be moving, which means that more railcars need to come out of storage. But the industry has also been scrapping railcars, with 40,000 scrapped so far this year and potentially 50,000 to 55,000 scrapped by year's end, according to Savage. Meanwhile, an estimated 31,000 railcars are expected to be delivered this year. As a result, we're going to actually see a net reduction in the fleet size this year, and that contraction has not happened in the last 10 years. So, that's also a benefit for getting some cars out of the system and then opening up the need for new railcar deliveries, Savage said. Third-quarter financial results Trinity's net income was $25.1 million, or 17 cents per adjusted diluted share, in the third quarter of 2020, compared with $49 million, or 39 cents per adjusted diluted share, in the third quarter of 2019. Revenue fell nearly 44% to $459.4 million on lower deliveries in Trinity's Rail Products Group, as well as fewer railcars sold on the lease fleet. Operational expenses were down nearly 18% to $51.2 million. (Trinity Industries) Fleet utilization was 94.8% in the third quarter versus 96.7% a year ago amid demand decreases from energy-driven markets. (Trinity Industries) Trinity's third quarter performance reflects solid execution against numerous headwinds including competitive pricing, declining deliveries, and difficult decisions in rightsizing our operations, Savage said in a release. Through it all, Trinity's rail platform, which generates significant cash flow, and our strong balance sheet have enabled us to manage through the current environment from a position of strength. Average lease rates and the utilization of the company's lease fleet were flat between the second and third quarters, while lease rate renewal pricing continued to experience headwinds, Savage said. Rail manufacturing received orders for 2,000 railcars during the third quarter, composed primarily of larger, complex transactions, she said. Trinity, others seek to create rail technology platform Trinity is part of a venture with other rail stakeholders to create a new technology platform that will seek to utilize GPS as well as other telematics technology across the North American railcar fleet. We've been developing the analytics and infrastructure to support the addition of telematics on railcars and have partnered with other leading rail service providers to create a new technology platform called Rail Pulse that we believe will transform rail shipping in the future, Savage said Thursday on the call. Others involved in this venture are railcar lessor GATX (NYSE:GATX), short line operators Genesee & Wyoming and Watco, and Class I railroad Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania helped secure additional federal funding for the venture via the Consolidated Rail Infrastructure and Safety Improvements (CRISI) grant program. The partners, which own nearly 20% of the North American railcar fleet, say the technology will promote safety objectives via the collection of hand brake and impact data. The technology is being further developed to include capabilities such as onboard bearing temperature and wheel impact detection sensors. They also say the technology will improve visibility into the status, location and condition of individual railcars, which they say will meaningfully contribute to rail industry growth. Telematics capabilities will include data capture to support real-time track-level visibility, whether doors or hatches are open, whether the car is loaded or partially loaded, and other key performance metrics, the groups said in a joint release. The technology will consist of a neutral, open-architecture, industrywide railcar telematics platform to make it easier to ship by rail and to track rail shipments across the North American rail network, all while ensuring the safety and security of proprietary car-owner data, they said. Rail Pulse is another example of how the freight rail industry is using advanced technology to enhance safety and service to shippers, said Jennie Granger, deputy secretary of multimodal transportation for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT). PennDOT is proud of the strong partnership we have with the freight rail industry, and we look forward to this platform being implemented throughout the North American railcar fleet. The partners expect the platform to be available for the industry by the end of 2022. Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.

2020-11-10,J.B. Hunt Sees Elevated Demand Through At Least Q1,"Management from J.B. Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) said a high-demand environment is likely to continue through at least the first quarter of 2021. In a virtual presentation at Baird's 2020 Global Industrial Conference on Tuesday, Shelley Simpson, chief commercial officer and president of highway services, described the current freight market as tight and more chaotic than expected, noting ongoing dislocation in volumes and capacity. The influx of containers to the West Coast has caused service bottlenecks on the railroads and the lack of available warehouse labor has resulted in delays unloading containers and trailers at customer facilities. On a recent call with 70% to 80% of the company's customers, Simpson said routing guide failures throughout the industry were the chief complaint. The lack of capacity due to increased freight demand, equipment taking longer to unload and carriers opting for higher rates outside of their contractual commitments are driving the disruption. As supply chains play catch-up from the inventory shock caused by COVID, the demand for physical goods in need of transportation remains high. Consumers are substituting spending on services for hard goods to improve their stay-at-home lifestyles. Further, the potential for a winter wave of the virus has many retailers taking on additional inventory to avoid potential stock-outs. Simpson said the bulk of J.B. Hunt's client inventories are low and that the replenishment cycle appears to have several months of runway. So far in the fourth quarter, weekly intermodal traffic on the U.S. Class I railroads is up nearly 10% on average compared to 2019, according to the Association of American Railroads. J.B. Hunt's rail partners Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and BNSF Railway ((Berkshire Hathaway, NYSE:BRK) have seen volumes increase 4% and 9% respectively quarter-to-date. Dedicated rolling along, final mile is ‘booming' Nick Hobbs, J.B. Hunt's president of dedicated and final mile, said the dedicated division just saw a record month for inquiries into engineering designs as demand for guaranteed truck capacity remains high. The division converts private trucking fleets into J.B. Hunt's dedicated operation, managing and operating the equipment on clients' behalf. J.B. Hunt reported the addition of 890 trucks to the dedicated fleet through the end of the third quarter, surpassing the 2020 goal for additions of 600 to 800 units. Hobbs believes the dedicated operation will add 800 to 1,000 trucks annually over the next few years. He said driver turnover is the lowest J.B. Hunt has ever had but noted that sign-on bonuses and pay increases will be a cost headwind given challenges recruiting new drivers. Drivers are in short supply as demand has surged. The decline in available drivers is largely due to fears surrounding COVID-19, the impact of the Drug & Alcohol Clearinghouse and low driver school enrollment. The final-mile segment was hit hard by COVID but Hobbs said it's back up and booming. He said the industry is still highly fragmented and most providers aren't being price disciplined in their attempts to win freight, creating a wild, wild West environment. He believes J.B. Hunt will be able to solve industry pricing through superior service. Meeting time delivery windows, strong execution of in-home installations and providing qualified and safe drivers are part of the value proposition. A quality service model is expected to drive pricing higher, improving the division's margins. Year three of J.B. Hunt 360 The company is in year three of its $500 million investment in J.B. Hunt 360, a digital platform connecting shippers and carriers to find the most efficient and cost-effective shipping solution for both. The multimodal platform wasn't around for most of the company's growth to $10 billion in revenue but is expected to be the key driver as it reaches for the next $10 billion. During the third quarter, brokerage revenue processed through 360 increased 42% year-over-year to $291 million and the number of tractors available from contracted carriers on the platform increased 16% to 777,000. The intermodal division executed $41 million of third-party drayage expense on the site with the truck segment seeing $26 million in independent contractor costs recorded. Results will continue to improve as the offering is further scaled. Carrier engagement has been high and shippers continue to come online. A bulk of the heavy investment has been incurred. Management believes returns will improve as more revenue is added over a relatively subdued cost structure. Click for more FreightWaves articles by Todd Maiden.

2020-11-13,Q3 Rail Recap: The Good And Not So Good,"With the railroads' third-quarter earnings releases over and done, it's time to take a look at who the winners and laggards were in Q3. For commodities, the answer might be looking at North American rail volumes in the third quarter. Grain is one obvious winner. U.S. grain volumes were up 27.8% in September and 25.5% in October, according to the Association of American Railroads, while Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) and CN (NYSE:CNI) reported record grain movements over the last several months. Potash, which is used for fertilizer production, has also seen increased activity. Other winners have included intermodal, with volumes up year-over-year. Although trade uncertainties had put pressure on intermodal last year, e-commerce has helped to boost volumes as consumers have had to stay home because of the coronavirus, according to Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst for Edward Jones. The rails have been really able to gain from that, Windau said. A positive housing market has also supported intermodal and lumber volumes, he said. Meanwhile, low oil prices and oversupply have challenged energy products and frac sand, while automotive volumes have a less clear trajectory because although auto sales have been rebounding tremendously, they aren't doing as well as they could be for some rails, Windau said. That could be partly due to plant shutdowns, which have resulted in less product to move. Who are the winners operationally? In terms of individual railroads, the companies that could be perceived as winners are those that are further along in their implementation of precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operating model that seeks to streamline operations. PSR has helped the railroads improve their operating ratios, which is a company's operating expenses as a percentage of a company's revenue. A lower operating ratio can imply improved financial health. To that regard, Edward Jones has buys for CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and CP, and it has holds for Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and CN. The firm doesn't cover privately held BNSF (NYSE:BRK) or Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU). Looking ahead, tight trucking markets could offer some opportunities for the railroads because the railroads have been improving their service and there are cost advantages for longer hauls, Windau said. The Canadian railways also have some advantages over the U.S. counterparts because they can go higher speeds and they have easy access to the U.S. Midwest markets via Detroit and Chicago, he said. Meanwhile, FreightWaves market commentator Jim Blaze sees the railroads' attempts to lengthen trains as one of the winners of the third quarter. Longer trains increase productivity even amid a global health pandemic, although the question is how much longer can the trains go if the sidings don't go longer themselves. Truckers can't do that. … That to me is one of the reasons why the six Class Is have lower operating ratios. They're continuing to reduce unit costs against labor costs, Blaze said. Blaze compared the wesern U.S. railroads against each other and did the same for the eastern U.S. railroads. BNSF appears to be willing to adjust its price to gain market share, while Union Pacific (UP) appears to be more focused on pricing and so it's not gaining as many volumes as BNSF, Blaze said. CSX has been performing better because it has matured in its deployment of PSR, while Norfolk Southern is more of an intermodal carrier but is still working on implementing PSR, he said. And both carriers need to replace coal traffic, which is facing a systemic decline. Meanwhile, the strikes in Mexico have dampened Kansas City Southern's (KCS) outlook, although KCS' Mexican franchise is the highest growth potential overall, Blaze said. But are the winners really winners and the laggards really lagging? Although higher rail volumes and lower operating ratios might appear to look like winners, there are some complexities underlying the winners. For instance, Canadian grain producers told FreightWaves that the railways can't haul all the grain volumes that could be hauled because grain producers compete with other commodities for trains. There's a lot left on the table, said Greg Northey, vice president of corporate affairs for Pulse Canada, with members that produce grains such as dry peas, lentils, beans and chickpeas. Meanwhile, the U.S. ports were flush with volumes this fall, resulting in some service issues for intermodal. UP recently acknowledged that service, as measured by its trip plan compliance, could have been better in the third quarter. The lack of improvement for trip plan compliance for intermodal in the third quarter really reflected the impact that we've seen across the entire intermodal supply chain and the sharp West Coast volume increase, said UP Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Hamann at the Baird investor conference on Tuesday. We exited October though with some very good momentum, and in fact, October, we achieved an 83% on-time performance in terms of intermodal trip plan compliance. Hamann later said the abruptness of the volume rebound contributed to service hiccups in the third quarter. We had the ability to call back and produce very quickly and did, but it's still you got to restart that engine, and the flows were very imbalanced. And that caused some headaches as well. But when I look at it, and I think about historically, how I think we probably would have handled that quick snap up and down volume versus how we did with our PSR mindset, and with the new agility that our operating team has, I think we did a really fantastic job, she said. As Blaze looks ahead, one question is the definition of a winner. Does a winner mean growing market share versus growing volumes? Or does it mean shrinking market share but growing in free cash flow? We may not know who the winners and losers are, but that's how the game is setting up, Blaze said. Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.

2020-11-16,"Pan Am, Conversions To Rail And Train Lengths — Oh My!","A CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) executive confirmed that CSX has talked with short line Pan Am Railways about a possible future involving both companies, but he declined to comment further on the issue. You might have seen what we've sort of said publicly on Pan Am. We did confirm that we have had discussions with Pan Am about that property. Beyond that, I'm not going to comment any further, said CSX's Mark Wallace at the Baird investors conference Thursday. Wallace is the executive vice president for sales and marketing for CSX. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) executives also spoke at the conference (see below). Wallace continued, But more broadly, listen. We evaluate how we deploy cash the same way that we always have and we always will, right? We look at investments, whether they're internal investments or things that we're going to do strategically. We look at high-return projects and whether … it's a great return for our shareholders and whether it helps our customers longer term. Wallace was referring to recent reports that CSX has been inquiring about acquiring Pan Am. Pan Am has come up in recent months as a company that could be open to an acquisition or for leasing. Wallace added that as CSX evaluates potential investments, the company looks at whether the investment would extend the company's reach and how the investment would benefit shippers. If we can take our model and overlay that model onto another property and produce the types of returns and results that we have at CSX or ShipCSX, then I think those are things that we would consider doing. So we're always on the lookout for interesting projects. But that's sort of how we evaluate those options, whether it's internal investments or things that we're considering externally, Wallace said. Recently, CSX competitor Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) responded to CSX's actions via a Nov. 6 letter to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) saying that it is concerned about a potential acquisition because Norfolk Southern (NS) has joint control with Pan Am over Pan Am Southern, an affiliate. NS is concerned that the way in which CSX is seeking ownership avoids the board's approval of the acquisition. In response to NS' letter to the STB, CSX said it has been in discussions with Pan Am Railways Inc. regarding a possible transaction. As part of this effort, CSX has engaged directly with Norfolk Southern to understand any issues they might have. Besides offering comments about CSX's dealings with Pan Am, Wallace also talked about how it is seeking more highway-to-rail conversion opportunities. CSX has taken steps recently to revamp and enhance its marketing efforts, utilize new technologies and focus on data and analytics to win customers. Coupled with CSX's efforts to improve rail service, CSX is winning share even in this challenging environment, Wallace said. To find those conversion opportunities, CSX is looking at where it currently operates and asking existing customers that use both truck and rail whether they would consider moving more volumes to rail. CSX is also speaking with potential customers that have traditionally relied on trucks but are open to talking with CSX about rail because of the tightening truck market, Wallace said. CSX has been able to convert customers to rail in the aggregates sector, as well as in metals and forest products, Wallace said. CSX is having conversations with potential and existing customers and is really turning tables a little bit and saying, ‘We want to be a bigger part of your overall transportation spend and what else can we do to you to improve your flow to get your products to market?' Wallace said. So those are conversations that are ongoing and we expect to have more success in the coming quarters and years on that front. Union Pacific watching train lengths One of the ways that Union Pacific (UP) has been able to reach productivity savings has been to lengthen trains. UP has also been focusing on freight car velocity and reducing terminal dwell. To achieve longer train lengths, UP has been constructing 15,000-foot sidings along some areas of its network and it intends to continue lengthening sidings in 2021, according to Jennifer Hamann, UP's chief financial officer. But while UP's physical infrastructure is one factor toward lengthening trains, others factors include ensuring volume density along the lanes and providing good service to customers, according to Hamann. I don't know that we know the limit of what that [train length] can be. It has to be kind of a composite look in terms of what are all the factors that are available to us. The footprint, the physical infrastructure: Is it going to limit us? Hamann asked last Tuesday. It's really going to be dictated more by the volumes that are coming off where they're coming on and how we're able to design the transportation plan around that, to have that long train length as we meet our customers' demands. During the presentation, Hamann reiterated UP's volume guidance for the fourth quarter, saying that volume growth will be in the low single digits, which would be the first quarter with positive year-over-year growth in two years. As a result, UP expects full-year volumes to be down by 7% or so. Productivity savings will also exceed $700 million and that, coupled with UP's pricing strategy and the volume outlook, could result in an operating ratio in the 50s, Hamann said. Operating ratio (OR) is a tool some investors used to gauge the financial health of a company, with a lower OR implying improved health. Meanwhile, the surcharges that UP placed upon certain intermodal services on the West Coast were in order for UP to protect some of their network capacity, according to Hamann. We have programs with some of our domestic intermodal customers where they commit to giving us so much volumes over the course of the year and we commit to giving them box availability. And that's really what the surcharges are about, helping protect those customer commitments, Hamann said. I think they achieved what we wanted them to achieve. It's really about better control of the flows. And I think that they were successful in that and we'll keep them in place as long as we think we need to relative to the rail environment.

2020-11-25,Class I Railroads Grapple With COVID-19 As Unions Seek Safety Assurances,"With coronavirus cases rising sharply in the U.S. and Canada in recent weeks, the Class I railroads have also been grappling with managing increased COVID-19 exposure on their networks. Meanwhile, some rail union members contend that the railroads have been inconsistent with how safety precautions have been applied throughout the rail network (see below). A CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) executive recently said his company has been seeing a lot of cases within the U.S. rail network, particularly in the Midwest. Indeed, in the past seven days, coronavirus cases have shot up in the Upper Midwest, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For instance, the CDC determined that there have been 9,656 cases per 100,000 residents in North Dakota over the past seven days. In contrast, New York City, an early COVID-19 hotbed, has seen about 3,598 cases per 100,000 residents. We've seen some hot spots of employees that are having to go out because they've got the disease. And so we're dealing with it, said Mark Wallace, CSX executive vice president of sales and marketing, at the Baird investor conference on Nov. 12. Wallace continued, The most important thing that we've learned, and my sales and marketing team has done a remarkable job and a great job of, is really communicating with customers and keeping everybody abreast of what's going on, the challenges that we've experienced, what we're doing, the action plans that we're putting in place to monitor and to recover and to get their service back up and going. So we're all learning from this. CSX told FreightWaves it has implemented safety protocols that align with CDC guidelines. But with case numbers climbing in many states and localities, CSX has taken swift action to enhance vigilance and to best ensure we keep our employees safe and protect our operations, the railroad said. Those safeguards include rigorous sanitation practices and a mandatory face-covering requirement whenever employees are in common areas or within 6 feet of another person. Other safeguards include restricting visitor access and isolating employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus or who have been in contact with a confirmed case. We maintain ongoing communication with our customers to keep them informed and to be able to quickly address any service- or pandemic-related issues that may impact changes to their operations. In addition to the measures aimed at protecting employee health and safety, CSX has taken steps to ensure we are adequately staffed throughout the pandemic, CSX said. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) has adopted safety protocols similar to CSX, such as required facial coverings in public work areas, social distancing and increased access to hand sanitizer. The railroad also said employees are using disinfecting wipes to frequently wipe down work surfaces. Locomotive cabs have also been supplied with disinfectant spray and cloths so that train crews can wipe down throttles, arm rests and other surfaces, Union Pacific (UP) said. UP said its rail network is currently fluid and service hasn't been impacted as a result of COVID-19. We continue to ask employees to stay home if they experience symptoms consistent with COVID-19, UP said. Union Pacific's health and medical team works with employees diagnosed with the virus, conducts contact tracing to identify employees who may have been exposed and guides them during the quarantine process. We also have procedures in place to decontaminate work areas when someone tests positive. BNSF (NYSE:BRK) told FreightWaves that its two main objectives throughout the pandemic have been to protect the health of employees and to keep trains running. The railroad said it has been grounding operational decisions in CDC guidance and making adjustments as needed. Some of the actions we have taken over time ensure that we are better prepared and able to move quickly when conditions change. As we look to the future, the lessons of resilience and perseverance we learned will stay with us, BNSF said. As the economy has started to recover and volumes return, we will remain focused on delivering strong service performance across our network so we are well positioned to handle our customers' freight. We have, and continue to, work with customers to identify and closely monitor critical shipments and take action to ensure that they make it to their destination on time. Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) echoed those sentiments, saying its two primary objectives are to protect the health and well-being of employees and ensure the continuity of essential business operations. The railroad said it has seen the number of COVID-19 cases rise at KCS in the U.S. and Mexico, but despite that, it has not impacted our ability to provide crews for essential train operations. KCS has aggressively implemented important health and safety measures, like required mask wearing, social distancing, handwashing, medical management, intensified cleaning of equipment and facilities, etc. All of these efforts combined are helping KCS keep people healthy, while maintaining essential operations for our customers and the larger economy, KCS said. Railroads inconsistent in COVID-19 responses: BMWED Although the railroads have been stocking employees with sanitation equipment, rail workers see several problems with how the railroads have responded to the pandemic, according to Jed Dodd, vice president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees Division (BMWED). BMWED is affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. One concern is that the railroads have been inconsistent with how they deploy CDC's safety protocols. Dodd argues that while some industries and individual companies such as Amazon have required employees to undergo temperature tests and contact tracing, the railroads have been haphazard in deploying those measures. Since March, BMWED has determined that there have been 10 coronavirus-related fatalities, with hundreds of people out sick. It's the complete lack of direction on the use of these [cleaning] supplies and how to get them, Dodd said. There is an effort to get cleaning supplies out but it's not a major focus of the railroad company and so a lot of people fall through the cracks. Another problem is that the burden of ensuring a safe work environment falls on the employee, which is due in part to the broader industry's culture, in which injuries are the fault of the employee because the employee violated the rules, according to Dodd. But the biggest problem is that the railroads differ in their lost-time policies, with some companies offering those policies while others don't. But even if companies offer lost-time policies, it can take months for an employee to collect those benefits, Dodd said. He cited CSX as one company where members have encountered challenges with lost-time policies. As a result, we believe there are many more people who are very reluctant to report symptoms in fear that they won't be able to work, Dodd said. Dodd attributes what he considers the inconsistent response of the rail industry to the lack of direction from the federal government and the White House on how to cope with the pandemic. In the beginning, I don't think you could hold the railroads responsible. But a month later, it's time to wake up, Dodd said, adding that if the railroads require employees to come to work, they should be the ones responsible for keeping employees as safe as possible. CSX responded to Dodd's assertions about lost-time policies, saying, Our highest priority is the safety and well-being of our employees, their families and the communities where we operate. Employees unable to work due to the impacts of COVID may use paid time off entitlements provided under their respective collective bargaining agreements and sickness benefits provided by the Railroad Retirement Board. Separately, UP said it is giving union-affiliated agreement employees who have worked at least 30 days during the pandemic a one-time $1,000 gross bonus in December. The bonus applies to all current agreement employees, including those who have been furloughed, who have worked for at least 30 days between March 1 and Nov. 30. While many fellow citizens were sheltering in place, our craft professionals rolled up their sleeves and answered the nation's call during one of its greatest times of need, said UP President and CEO Lance Fritz. The pivotal role these essential employees play delivering critical supplies and keeping the economy open cannot be emphasized enough. This recognition reflects how notable their efforts are and how much their great work is appreciated. Meanwhile, the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC) said it is working with the railroads to address pandemic-related safety concerns. Coronavirus cases totaled 337,555 nationwide as of Monday, according to the Canadian government, with cases climbing sharply after Oct. 1. In collaboration with the rail companies, we enhanced cleaning and disinfecting protocols for locomotives, rest facilities and other locations. We also lobbied for paid time off for members who are asked by the company to self-isolate, said Lyndon Isaak, TCRC president. Although we found common ground for many issues, we are still attempting to address others. Outstanding challenges include safe training methods and maintaining consistent cleaning and disinfecting protocols across the various rail systems. Isaak continued, With cases rising at a dramatic rate in Canada, our goal is to protect rail workers at all costs. We will do this by maintaining pressure on the carriers to ensure that the pandemic protocols are strictly followed and continue to be effective in this fast-changing situation. The stakes are high when it comes to the health and safety of our members. If our rail systems go down, what will happen to our country? The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, SMART-Transportation Division and the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO didn't respond to requests for comment. Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP), CN (NYSE:CNI) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) also didn't return requests for comment.

2020-12-17,"Port Congestion, Delays Disrupting J.B. Hunt's Intermodal Network","Container restrictions from the railroads due to high levels of congestion at the ports are causing disruption to service for intermodal providers like J.B. Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT). The company earlier this week issued a service advisory extending through Saturday as its partners BNSF Railway -- Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) unwind the glut of boxes and trailers backed up in the key intermodal markets of Los Angeles and Chicago. Severe ramp congestion is impacting the intermodal network in Chicago and Southern California, delaying both inbound and outbound loads, according to the statement. Both railroads have implemented gate restrictions and closures for standard service level shipments in efforts to expedite the recovery. BNSF has limited the number of shipments that can be ingated for all destinations at terminals in Los Angeles and San Bernardino, California. Chicago gate restrictions include most destinations west and south, including Seattle, Portland, Oregon, Denver, Phoenix, Houston and Mexico. Norfolk Southern has closed two-way service at its 63rd Street terminal in Chicago to and from Pittsburgh, Toledo, Ohio, and Buffalo, New York. As a result of railroad restrictions and closures, J.B. Hunt's ability to pick up freight in the lanes listed above is expected to be impacted through Saturday, December 19, the statement read. The notice said a representative will communicate load-specific delays, along with alternative rail and highway routing options. The delays and service outages have been brought about by increased online spending as well as an ongoing inventory restocking effort by retailers. Container shipments should be declining this time of year as most holiday-related cargo has already been shipped. However, the traditional seasonal slowdown hasn't happened as intermodal traffic on the railroads has remained steady, at a high level, since mid-September. In fact, total intermodal units climbed 3.6% sequentially to more than 308,000 in the latest week that ended last Saturday, according to the Association of American Railroads. Intermodal traffic was up 11% year-over-year over the last four weeks. The intermodal disruption in Los Angeles and Chicago is likely to impact other intermodal carriers as well, including Knight-Swift Transportation (NYSE:KNX) and Schneider National (NYSE:SNDR).

2020-12-17,"CN, Others To Develop Plastics Resins Export Facility In Alabama","Canadian railway CN (NYSE:CNI) has partnered with others to develop a high-tech logistics near the Port of Mobile in Alabama for the export of plastics resins or pellets. CN, Mississippi Export Railroad subsidiary Alabama Export Railroad and Ray-Mont Logistics expect the first phase of the logistics park in Mobile to be open in late 2021. The facility, designed to bag and containerize plastic pellets, will have an annual capacity of 25,000 twenty-foot equivalent units. With this new project CN is committed to enabling growth and success for our partners and our customers. CN is once again using the strength of its unique tri-coastal network, and close collaboration with its supply chain partners, to help customers win in their markets, said James Cairns, CN's senior vice president for the rail-centric supply chain. Other commodities could also be shipped someday through the facility, although there is no set timeline for that to occur, CN spokesperson Mathieu Gaudreault told FreightWaves. CN and other stakeholders say the facility, which is near the Port of Mobile, will provide customers with export capacity to access Asian, Latin American and European markets without having to take on additional costs for warehousing or double handling. We believe this project represents the first step toward the establishment of a multicommodity logistics hub, which will serve producers and global markets for decades to come, said Alabama Export Railroad President and CEO Kate C. Luce. Our interest in pursuing this intermodal opportunity is due in part to the continued federal and state investments at the Port of Mobile, as well as the recent announcement of additional container capacity at APM Terminals. For its part, the Port of Mobile has several multimillion-dollar, capacity-expanding projects underway or under consideration. The Alabama Port Authority completed a 400-foot container dock extension at the APM Terminal Mobile in March, enabling the terminal to simultaneously handle two container ships. The extension was part of a wider $50 million plan to increase terminal capacity and productivity. The port authority and APM Terminals have invested $450 million in marine and rail container intermodal terminals at the port, while the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is working on improving the harbor and channel at Mobile. Meanwhile, MTC Logistics is building a nearly 300,000-square-foot refrigerated warehouse facility that is expected to open in early 2021, while automotive lift manufacturer BendPak opened a 100,000-square-foot distribution center 11 miles from the APM Terminals Mobile this year. In addition to CN, Class I railroads serving the Port of Mobile include BNSF (NYSE: BRK-B), CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC).

2021-03-01,CSX Seeks STB Approval Of Pan Am Railways Acquisition,"Eastern U.S. railroad CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) has started the regulatory process to acquire New England short line operator Pan Am Railways in a move that CSX hopes will strengthen its intermodal presence in the region. The company on Thursday submitted its application to the Surface Transportation Board. The application includes a request both to acquire the Pan Am System, which includes Pan Am Railways, and a 50% ownership of Pan Am Southern (PAS). CSX is excited to introduce our customer-centric focus, supply chain solutions and industry-leading operating model to shippers and industries served by Pan Am, CSX said in a statement Friday. The decision to acquire Pan Am reflects CSX's interest in leveraging its best-in-class service and safety to improve rail's competitiveness with other transportation modes and to reduce the number of trucks operating in New England. According to CSX's filing, the short lines and assets associated with Pan Am Railways include Pan Am Systems, Pan Am Railways, the Boston and Maine Corp., Maine Central Railroad, Northern Railroad, Portland Terminal, Springfield Terminal Railway, Stony Brook Railroad and Vermont & Massachusetts Railway. CSX also seeks to acquire partial ownership of PAS, which is also partially owned by competitor Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). CSX said Friday it had reached an agreement with Norfolk Southern (NS) over PAS' operations. NS will retain ownership of PAS, while a subsidiary of Genesee and Wyoming (G&W) will operate and maintain PAS, which was formerly operated by Springfield Terminal Railway. The selection of a G&W affiliate is based upon our desire to maintain competition and enhance rail service in the New England market, CSX said Friday. G&W's existing presence, relationships and experience will greatly assist the transition. According to CSX's filing, NS will continue to seek to operate up to one pair of intermodal and automotive trains daily to service facilities in Ayer, Massachusetts. To do this, NS will seek to obtain trackage rights over existing lines owned by four railroads: CSX, two Pan Am railroads and a G&W subsidiary. CSX also said in its filing that it considers its application requesting to acquire Pan Am as a minor transaction because it is clear that the proposed transaction … will have no adverse impact on competition. The railroad is hoping the board will consider approving the application sometime within the next six months, according to Thursday's filing. We look forward to integrating Pan Am into CSX, with substantial benefits to the rail-served industries of the Northeast, and to working in partnership with connecting railroads to provide exceptional supply chain solutions to New England and beyond, CSX said. We are likewise confident that G&W's subsidiary will bring similar benefits to PAS customers as the successful operator of PAS.

2021-03-22,3 Railroad Stocks To Watch Amid Canadian Pacific And Kansas City Southern Merger,"Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (NYSE:CP) and Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) announced on Sunday they would merge in a deal valued at about $29 billion in cash and shares. What Happened: The new company, Canadian Pacific Kansas City, will create a Canada-Mexico-U.S. railroad with a combined 20,000 miles of rail. Canadian Pacific Kansas City will be a larger competitor to other rail service providers and will ease supply chain difficulties between the three member countries of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). It will also provide the companies’ customers with an eco-friendlier alternative to truck transportation, according to Canadian Pacific's press release. Why It Matters: The Canadian Pacific Kansas City rail service will have three main competitors to keep on watch: Canadian National Railways (NYSE:CNI), headquartered in Montreal, Quebec operates 20,000 miles of rail across Canada, the Midwest and the Southern United States and through Mexico. Canadian National has a market cap of $80.89 billion and was trading down 2.25% at $113.90 at last check. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UCP), headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, boasts 32,340 miles of route track across the Midwest, West and Southwestern United States. Union Pacific has a market cap of $139.37 billion and was trading down 1.87% at $206.86 at last check. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC), headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, operates 19,500 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Norfolk Southern has a market cap of $66.24 billion and was trading up 0.96% at $262.96 at last check. (Photo: Canadian Pacific Railway)"
2021-03-24,5 Wall Street Impressions About Proposed CP-KCS Merger,"Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) announced plans to acquire Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) for $29 billion on Sunday morning. Here are five initial impressions from Wall Street transportation analysts about this proposed transaction. Wall Street likes the deal The merger of CP and Kansas City Southern (KCS) would be combining two of the smallest Class I railroads. It would also be integrating two railroads that are striving to reach an operating ratio (OR) in the mid-50s. OR, represented in a percentage such as 55%, is a tool investors use to gauge the financial health of a company, with a lower OR implying improved financial health. We believe the fit of the two rail systems and strategic logic is good. Both railroads have track records of delivering volume growth and the significant extension of CP's reach should allow meaningful revenue synergies, said a Monday note from UBS (NYSE:UBS) transportation analyst Tom Wadewitz. However, like other observers, Wall Street will also be watching how the Surface Transportation Board, the regulatory body that would approve the merger, considers CP's proposed acquisition, noting that the board has been mindful of shippers' concerns in recent and ongoing proceedings. Could the third time be a charm? CP has considered merging with two other Class I railroads — CSX (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) — in the past seven years. But this merger would be different because it would be with a much smaller railroad revenuewise. The regulatory consideration is an important one because in 2016, during CP's attempted takeover of Norfolk Southern (NSC), the attempt ended after heightened scrutiny from the Obama administration on antitrust issues, said Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) analyst Amit Mehrotra. But we note at that time NSC rejected CP's offer, whereas [this] announcement is a friendly deal, and KSU is only about one-fourth the size of NSC from a revenue standpoint — i.e., pro forma for the deal CPKC will still be the smallest Class I rail. CPKC stands for the name for the new company. Could this result in more mergers and acquisitions? Although analysts are uncertain whether the CP-KCS transaction will result in a wave of mergers and acquisitions with the freight railroad industry, the proposed acquisition points to an industry that seeks to pivot to growth after implementing precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operational tool that seeks to streamline operations and cut costs. This transaction could get other railroads thinking about the urge to merge. Aside from other mergers, CPKC is targeting nearly $800 [million] in revenue synergies by 2025. These are likely to be spread fairly evenly over the time frame and come from three main buckets: intermodal/automotive, bulk and carload, said Cowen (NASDAQ:COWN) analyst Jason Seidl in a Monday note. Some of these wins will undoubtedly be taken off the highway as a complete interline service should make for a more reliable rail product. On its deal call, management mentioned that it plans to offer new services as well due to the increased reach and specifically mentioned some routes east of Chicago. Some of these could be taken from other rail operators in our view. Bascome Majors, analyst for Susquehanna Financial Group (OTC:SQCF), said, To be clear, we wouldn't expect other Class I deals to be announced near term, with executives, boards and advisers of other rails closely watching the CP-KSU litmus test for the STB's current merger appetite before diving in. But if CP-KSU were to show signs of regulatory traction, a full-fledged final round of Class I consolidation could follow in 2022-2025. Which railroads would be affected by this? Competing Canadian railway CN (NYSE:CNI) is likely to be affected by the merger since it has a T-shaped network consisting of the two Canadian coasts and the U.S. Gulf Coast. The CP-KCS combination would also have a T-shaped network. But Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) could face a potential share shift, particularly for automotive and intermodal traffic, because of its cross-border network with Mexico. BNSF (NYSE:BRK) could also be exposed as well to potential competition for grain transport in the Upper Midwest. The potential combination of CP and KSU would create a stronger north-south railroad competitor to UNP and CNI, Wadewitz said. UNP has an efficient route structure from Chicago to Texas and the border at Laredo and CP/KSU would also become a stronger competitor on traffic running north-south in the U.S. We would expect CP and KSU to move a portion of their interchange traffic with other railroads onto the new combined system if the deal is approved. But there is still a lot of regulatory uncertainty Despite initial expectations that STB would likely approve the deal, industry consolidation in the 1980s and 1990s has led to a field consisting of seven Class I railroads. Regulators — and shippers especially — are wary of additional consolidation. To be clear, we do believe the STB will ultimately approve the CP-KSU merger. But we're also prepared for the process to drag on beyond the mid-2022 approval timeline management laid out today, with an approval potentially including conditions offering modest concessions to customers and competitors, Majors said.

2021-04-26,"Rail Roundup: OmniTRAX, G&W Develop, Expand Partnerships","Shortline operator OmniTRAX is working with the River Ridge Development Authority of southern Indiana to develop the River Ridge Commerce Center. The center, located near Louisville, Kentucky, where it has access to several transportation modes. It connects directly with CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and is in close proximity to I-64, I-65, I-71, the Louisville International Airport, the Ohio River and the Port of Indiana-Jeffersonville. Manufacturing and distribution companies already at the center include Amazon, A&R Logistics, GE Appliances, Medline and BOSE. The center also is uniquely positioned to support the region's auto industry sector, OmniTRAX said. OmniTRAX is a well-respected and well-resourced transportation company that brings a unique combination of rail, supply chain and logistics expertise, decades of real estate development success and a national network that can serve the growing community needs and help River Ridge realize its full potential, said Jerry Acy, the River Ridge Development Authority's executive director. OmniTRAX said the River Ridge agreement connects existing customers and new prospects with a strategic centralized hub that offers excellent supply chain efficiencies to serve the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast markets. CSX is focused on delivering efficient and reliable rail service across our far-reaching network to help customers cultivate and grow their businesses, said CSX Senior Vice President of Marketing Farrukh Bezar. We look forward to the opportunities the new partnership will present for existing and prospective rail customers to connect to a larger network and new markets. OmniTRAX is a part of The Broe Group, an infrastructure investment firm based in Denver. Genesee & Wyoming Expans Rail Services Agreement With Georgia Ports Authority The Savannah Port Terminal Railroad (SAPT), an affiliate of short line operator Genesee & Wyoming (G&W), will include service to the Georgia Ports Authority's Mason Mega Rail Terminal serving the Port of Savannah. The service will be folded into the long-term rail services agreement that SAPT has with the port authority. Rail container capacity at the Port of Savannah is expected to double to 2 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) once the Mason Mega Rail project is completed this year. SAPT was founded by G&W in 1998 and provides rail intermodal and merchandise service, railcar switching and yardmaster services to the port. It operates over 18 track miles inside the port. An additional 15 track miles will serve the Mega Rail Terminal, which G&W says will have the ability to build and service six 10,000-foot trains simultaneously and cut transit times to the Midwest by 24 hours. SAPT interchanges with CSX and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). G&W owns or leases 116 freight railroads. The company serves 42 states and four Canadian provinces, and it has operations in the U.K. and in continental Europe.

2021-04-28,Norfolk Southern Achieves All-Time Quarterly Operating Ratio Record,"Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) reached an all-time quarterly record operating ratio (OR) in the first quarter amid a 7% increase in operating income. Norfolk Southern's (NS) OR was 61.5% in the first quarter of 2021, compared with an adjusted OR of 63.7% in the first quarter of 2020. On an unadjusted basis, first-quarter 2021 OR was 78.4%. The adjusted figure accounts for NS' sale of 703 locomotives that it deemed that it no longer needed. The sale resulted in a $385 million loss, which was the estimated value of the locomotives. Investors sometimes use OR to gauge the financial health of a company, with a lower OR implying improved health. The year-over-year also affected NS' earnings per share (EPS). First-quarter EPS was $2.66 per diluted share, compared with an adjusted EPS of $2.58 in the first quarter of 2020 and an unadjusted EPS of $1.47. Meanwhile, first-quarter net income was $673 million, compared with adjusted net income of $669 million a year ago. Operating revenues were $2.64 billion, compared with nearly $2.63 billion a year ago, amid a 3% increase in rail volumes. Operating expenses were $1.62 billion in the first quarter of 2021, compared to adjusted operating expenses of $1.67 billion and unadjusted operating expenses of $2.06 billion year-over-year. Operating income was nearly $1.02 billion in the first quarter of 2021, compared with adjusted operating income of $953 million for the first quarter of 2020. On an unadjusted basis, operating income in the first quarter of 2020 was $568 million. Our steadfast commitment to improving productivity and executing our precision scheduled railroading strategy has propelled us to another record operating ratio performance while we grew revenues and earnings in the quarter, said NS President and CEO Jim Squires. Our first-quarter results demonstrate our team's ability to deliver strong performance in the face of significant supply chain disruptions. The reopening of the economy provides meaningful tailwinds for continued strength in both the consumer and manufacturing sectors, and our long history of delivering sustainable transportation solutions for customers will continue to drive long-term value for our shareholders, customers and the communities we serve, Squires said.

2021-04-28,Expert Ratings for Norfolk Southern,"Analysts have provided the following ratings for Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) within the last quarter: Last 30 Days 1 Month Ago 2 Months Ago 3 Months Ago Bullish 0 0 0 1 Somewhat Bullish 0 0 0 1 Indifferent 0 0 1 0 Somewhat Bearish 0 1 0 2 Bearish 0 0 0 0 In the last 3 months, 8 analysts have offered 12-month price targets for Norfolk Southern. The company has an average price target of $221.5 with a high of $286.00 and a low of $135.00. This current average has increased by 12.84% from the previous average price target of $196.29. Analyst Ratings: What Are They? Ratings come from analysts, or specialists within banking and financial systems that report for specific stocks or defined sectors (typically once per quarter for each stock). Analysts usually derive their information from company conference calls and meetings, financial statements, and conversations with important insiders to reach their decisions. Analysts also give out recommendations like buy, sell, hold, or similar verbage for each stock based on their overall evaluations of the corres ponding company. A buy indicates that an analyst is optimistic about a stock's short-term or mid-term growth, recommending traders to purchase the stock. Contrastingly, a sell means that an analyst believes the stock will trend downwards in that same time frame. A hold suggests that investors should not buy more of or sell any of the specified stock due to that analyst's prediction of stagnation. Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders."
2021-05-12,DOT Seeks 'Careful And Prompt Consideration' Of Amtrak Service To Gulf Coast,"The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is supporting efforts to bring Amtrak service to the Gulf Coast, acknowledging the challenges that stakeholders have had in reaching a consensus over infrastructure and operational needs. A Monday letter from DOT, representing the interests of the agency as well as the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), asks the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to give careful and prompt consideration to Amtrak's request to provide daily service in 2022 between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Mobile, Alabama. Amtrak had asked STB in March to require CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) to permit Amtrak's proposed service. Amtrak's trains would run on track owned by CSX. We ask the board to give careful and prompt consideration to Amtrak's petition, and we will be glad to provide any additional information or resources that would aid in the board's decision-making process, said the letter written by John E. Putnam, DOT's acting general counsel. FRA looks forward to the opportunity to participate in any proceeding that the board initiates, to ensure that passenger rail service may expand consistent with the law, while robust freight rail service, essential to the nation's economy, is preserved. The letter said numerous federal studies have examined the prospect of providing Amtrak service on the Gulf Coast, and it said that one of the reasons why Amtrak service hasn't been restored is because of disagreements over how much investment would need to be made to enable Amtrak and freight rail service. Despite an extended period of examination and the investment of significant funds, Amtrak has been unable to obtain the agreement of the host freight railroads, and there is no clear or imminent path to the restoration of this service, absent the board's intercession, the letter said. According to DOT, FRA has previously estimated that $118 million would be needed to restore service, while CSX estimates that $2.3 billion would be needed. DOT also says there hasn't been enough data available to reach a conclusion about how best to restore service. FRA has been involved with a working group since 2015 to restore intercity passenger rail service to the Gulf Coast, although efforts stalled and were not brought to a successful resolution, according to the letter. The group's purpose was to examine potential options for service, including frequencies and trip times, and identify capital improvements needed for service restoration. The working group also consisted of representatives from Amtrak; the state DOT of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida; municipalities and communities along the route; regional transportation planning organizations; metropolitan planning organizations; the Southern Rail Commission; and rail carriers that would be affected, including CSX, Norfolk Southern (NS) and Florida DOT/SunRail. Furthermore, the lack of adequate data in a 2020 study convened by Amtrak, CSX and NS has also hampered efforts to restore service, according to DOT. That study, which DOT said would have served as the basis for what capital improvements would be needed, also received federal funding and involved FRA. Unfortunately, the Gulf Coast simulation study efforts failed to yield a consensus agreement on the sharing of relevant data inputs and model outputs, let alone the necessary scope of capital improvements, DOT said. FRA and Amtrak have repeatedly attempted to address concerns with CSX and Norfolk Southern about the conduct and completion of the study, but were unable to do so by the study's originally scheduled end date in January 2021. The letter continued, FRA remains concerned that it has been unable to obtain access to all the data and analysis necessary for a proper review of the issues involved in restoring service. Furthermore, at present, there does not appear to be any clear path forward for resolving these questions, absent the board's involvement. Indeed, CSX, NS and other stakeholders in Alabama, such as the Alabama State Port Authority, have also said that the lack of adequate data has hampered efforts to restore service, although they disagree with Amtrak and stakeholders in Mississippi about what data is and isn't available. In a Tuesday filing, CSX said it has supplied the data needed for the 2020 study to a third-party group overseeing the study. CSX said what Amtrak objects to is that it can't see the data provided by CSX and NS. Amtrak's complaint is that Amtrak did not get to see the data provided by CSXT [CSX Transportation] and NSR [Norfolk Southern Railway]. But that is exactly what the parties agreed to. In January 2020, Amtrak, CSXT and NSR all agreed to a data-sharing agreement, which provided that no party would be required to provide confidential business information (including stringline diagrams) to anyone other than HDR Engineering, the group contracted by Amtrak to conduct the 2020 study, CSX said. Thus, CSXT, NSR and Amtrak could share confidential data with HDR, but would not be required to share it with each other. The point of the RTC [rail traffic controller] study and data-sharing agreements was to designate HDR as the neutral third-party expert that would evaluate the limitations and needs of the Gulf Coast corridor and proposed passenger service, it said. And in an April 26 letter to STB, Alabama State Port Authority John C. Driscoll disagreed with how other regional stakeholders have characterized what data is available. As an example, Driscoll said he attended a September 2020 meeting of the Southern Rail Commission (SRC), an interstate rail compact, in which he said the port authority for Mobile wasn't asked to provide operational data that would help enable adequate rail traffic or modelling assessments. The Mississippi and Louisiana delegations of the SRC want STB to expedite Amtrak's request before the board, according to an April 23 letter to STB, but SRC's Alabama delegation did not sign the letter. After Amtrak filed its petition before the STB in March asking the board to compel CSX and NS to allow passenger rail service, CSX and NS filed a motion on April 5 asking the board to dismiss the proceeding. Amtrak objected to that motion in an April 26 filing. Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.

2021-05-14,5 Takeaways From Class I Railroads' Earnings Season,"The first-quarter 2021 earnings season for the Class I railroads is over. An optimistic volume outlook, especially for the second half of 2021, plans to improve operational efficiency and take market share away from trucks, and a proposed Class I Canadian railway merger with Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) were among the key themes expressed by railroad executives. The underlying message is there are expectations that the efficiency improvements are going to continue and they'll be able to leverage the improvements in volumes throughout the course of the year and be able to look at opportunities to grow their business, said Jeff Windau, an equities analyst with Edward Jones. As they're able to improve their efficiencies, it potentially gives them opportunities to look at other types of business to gain more volumes, like trying to get some more volumes from trucks. Here are five takeaways gleaned from earnings calls over the past month. A Merger Is Still On Everyone's Minds Kansas City Southern (KCS) said late Thursday that it is leaning toward going with CN (NYSE:CNI)'s proposal to acquire KCS. CN and its rival Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP) are both seeking to acquire KCS. 2021 maritime import shipment volume coming into the ports of LA and Long Beach remain above 2020 (orange) and 2019 (green) levels. (Source: SONAR) To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, click here. KCS was still deciding between the two merger offers during the weeks that the Class I railroads held their first-quarter earnings calls, and so many investors and Wall Street analysts wanted to know what individual Class I railroads thought about the efforts to merge with KCS. While KCS and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) declined to give their thoughts about a merger, CP and CN each gave their reasons why they are the better railway to merge with KCS. Meanwhile, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) and the privately held BNSF (NYSE:BRK) said they would ensure that any merger wouldn't encroach upon their customers' cross-border service needs. A KCS-CN merger is far from a done deal, and the Surface Transportation Board must still review it. But now that KCS is leaning toward CN's offer, investors and analysts could be watching whether CP will seek to merge with another partner should the KCS-CN be approved by KCS shareholders. But first, although CP has said it will not counterbid, the company hasn't yet conceded defeat and so the story is far from over. Easing Congestion At US Coastal Ports With U.S. imports coming into ports at high levels and vessels waiting outside West Coast ports to berth earlier this spring, the railroads were asked how they've contributed to clearing up the congestion at the ports. For Union Pacific (NYSE:UP), port congestion meant working with the ports and the ocean carriers about how to clear up congestion in the first quarter. In addition to trade and labor issues, the warehouses by the ports were just full and unable to physically take the container, according to Kenny Rocker, UP executive vice president for marketing and sales. We stay very coordinated with the customers on what they plan to do and what their forecasts are. … We've got visibility just talking to our customers from that perspective, Rocker said during UP's April 22 earnings call. We've made some changes to our accessorial charges to incentivize our customer to get the equipment moving. Regardless, whether it's our equipment or their equipment, we are sitting down with our customers to talk about efficiency and turn times and dwell and things they can do to get the network moving. 2021 maritime import shipment volume coming into the ports of LA and Long Beach remain above 2020 (orange) and 2019 (green) levels. (Source: SONAR) Said CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) President and CEO Jim Foote during his company's April 20 earnings call, We're part of a chain. We're a link in the chain. … It's easier to move the chain when it's not kinked and there's no problems in it and everything is working smoothly. So I think that all of us … could move more. Listen, the port guys don't want to put boxes on the ground because they don't have a chassis, because they don't have a truck to dray it. … The railroads are backed up because the railroads don't want to deal with somebody putting the box on the ground because of this. We all would like things to be smoother. North American Intermodal Traffic Anticipated To Show Strength Through 2021 An improving economy and continued e-commerce strength are macroeconomic factors that could support intermodal traffic through much of 2021, executives said during earnings calls. There's no more news on the second-half guidance. I would also just remind you that there is some kind of very high optimism on what the second quarter is going to look like just because the comps are so easy. But then when you get in the third and fourth quarter, we're starting to lap now the real acceleration in domestic intermodal, particularly the parcel world, said UP President and CEO Lance Fritz. And we're also then starting to lap some of the real strength in grain. So it has yet to be seen exactly how that plays out. But even in that context, our guidance stands. 2021 U.S. domestic intermodal volume (blue) will begin to face a more difficult comp to 2020 (orange) in the third quarter. (Source: SONAR) Although the chip shortage hampered automotive production in the first quarter, the rail market is hopeful that production will resume to more normal levels so that the automotive sector can meet pent-up consumer demand. The automotive sector continues to see strong consumer demand and low vehicle inventories. And we believe the OEMs will look to recover production, which was lost due to the semiconductor shortage, in the second half of the year, said KCS Chief Marketing Officer Mike Naatz during his company's April 16 earnings call. Bringing Back Power And Crews To meet anticipated growth in volumes, some of the Class I railroads said they have positioned equipment and locomotives to relieve potential pressure points. They have also begun hiring and training conductors while also searching for potential employees along certain areas of their networks. We're actually hiring conductors right now, getting ready for the second half of this year. So we're prepared, we're optimistic about the second half of this year in terms of the volume and that's really where our focus is preparing to move that, said CN Chief Operating Officer Rob Reilly during CN's April 26 earnings call. Operating Ratios And Revenue Targets Are Still In Effect Severe winter weather may have dampened rail volumes in February, but Class I executives were upbeat that their companies could still meet their targets for revenue and operating ratios for 2021. If you look in the quarter, there were definitely some pressures on operating ratios, and again, the weather was an impactor. We had a pretty sharp rise in fuel prices versus last quarter, and so those types of things really did weigh on the operating ratio, Windau said. But really, the rails were all feeling that they were able to handle those types of issues and were sticking with their forecasts and being able to improve operating ratios and that's what the market is expecting. The big picture is that the market is looking at the ability of these rails to leverage those operations improvements and improvements in costs management versus those rising volumes, to leverage that to the bottom line, he continued. While anticipated volume growth will help boost revenues, efforts to reduce costs or keep them flat should help lower operating ratios, the railroads said. Our outlook is to generate strong incrementals throughout the balance of the year, and that's how we're going to … shrink our operating ratio, said Norfolk Southern CFO Mark George during his company's April 28 earnings call. Our goal here is on pretty much all line items to absorb and … absorb the volume and hold the cost as flat as possible. And that's kind of the challenge and the mandate we've given to the organization. Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox.

2021-06-06,"The Past Week's Notable Insider Buys: Dun & Bradstreet, Norfolk Southern And More","Insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, especially when markets are near all-time highs. A SPAC, a couple of retailers and a railroad operator saw notable insider buying this past week. One chief executive officer added to two different stakes last week. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and 10% owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason — they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. So insider buying can be an encouraging signal for potential investors, particularly when there is uncertainty in the markets or the markets are near all-time highs. Note that with the earnings reporting season officially over, insiders overall are no longer prohibited from buying or selling shares. Here are some of the most noteworthy insider purchases that were reported in the past week. The sponsor and 10% owner of special purpose acquisition company ARYA Sciences Acquisition III Corp (NASDAQ:ARYA) indirectly bought more than 330,000 of its shares last week. At prices ranging from $10.01 to $10.15 per share, that cost the owner more than $3.31 million. This latest transaction raised the owner's stake to almost 490,000 shares. The purchase of almost 47,000 more PennyMac Financial Services Inc (NYSE:PFSI) shares by a director (and frequent buyer) for an average of $62.67 per share totaled more than $2.94 million. Note that a beneficial owner sold almost 191,300 shares of this California-based mortgage company last week as well. An officer at Franchise Group Inc (NASDAQ:FRG) acquired 50,000 shares early in the week. At $36 per share, the transactions added up to $1.80 million, and they lifted that officer's stake to more than 400,700 shares. Note that the CEO of this operator of franchised businesses, including Liberty Tax and Vitamin Shoppe, bought a million shares back in May. A First Financial Bankshares Inc (NASDAQ:FFIN) director purchased almost 29,800 shares early in the week. That director paid $50.85 apiece for those shares, which totaled more than $1.51 million. When Friday's session ended, the stock was trading at $51.66 per share, which was 24 cents below the all-time high. In the middle of the week, 1847 Goedeker Inc (NYSE:GOED) had three directors take advantage of a secondary offering to pick up a combined 557,600 shares at $2.24 apiece. Separately, an executive bought less than 600 shares of this internet retailer for $1.91 apiece. These transactions totaled around $1.25 million altogether. Following news of an acquisition, Vishay Precision Group Inc (NYSE:VPG) had a director indirectly purchase 30,000 shares at prices ranging from $34.91 to $36.29. This added up to more than $1.05 million. But the science and technical instruments maker ended the week trading at $34.73 per share. Dun & Bradstreet Holdings Inc (NYSE:DNB) CEO Anthony Jabbour and another officer stepped up to the buy window. The 50,700 shares they acquired altogether, at prices between $20.87 and $21.05, totaled over $1.06 million. Note that Jabbour, who is also the CEO of Black Knight Inc (NYSE:BKI), scooped up 13,900 of those shares via trust last week. The share prices ranged from $71.58 to $71.92, and these purchases totaled about $997,600. The stake was listed as up to nearly 75,700 shares, and the stock closed the week at $73.24 a share. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) had a director add more than 2,300 shares early last week. That totaled more than $664,300, at share prices averaging about $282.69. This railroad operator's stock slipped fractionally last week and ended Friday trading at $279.30 per share.

2021-06-07,Q&A: New Conrail President Sees Ample Intermodal Opportunities In Northeast,"Brain E. Gorton, Conrail's president and chief operating officer since April, recently chatted with FreightWaves about his vision for Conrail, a U.S. Northeast terminal railroad jointly owned by CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). As described in an October 2019 FreightWaves piece, Conrail performs car switching and yard classification work for its two owners, Norfolk Southern and CSX. It does not bill shippers or participate in the waybill. Strictly speaking, it serves as the railway local operating agent for its two owners. Gorton began his railroad career at Conrail, serving as a conductor in 1987. He most recently served as general manager of Union Pacific's (NYSE:UNP) Houston and Gulf Coast service units. He succeeded Timothy Tierney, who retired. This question-and-answer interview was edited for clarity and length: FREIGHTWAVES: What's your vision for Conrail? GORTON: After coming back after 30 years, it's great to see the growth. What North Jersey looked like 30 years ago looks nothing like what North Jersey looks like today. The amount of intermodal business that has come to the area — not to mention the growth in the oil trains, the garbage trains — is exciting to see. The vision is really to enhance customer service. And I know that sounds tongue-in-cheek, but the reality is that we provide world-class service to the customers we serve and to the owners that we represent. We are the face of both CSX and Norfolk Southern. We want them to know that their service has been provided in a quality, efficient manner by the Conrail team supporting the owners, both Norfolk Southern and CSX. Number two, I really want to look at the quality of life for our employees. I look at where some of our extra-board employees are working the extra-board list. [Editor's note: Extra-board employees are those under special terms and usually don't qualify for benefits or entitlements.] I want to improve their quality of life. I want to level load that work so the extra boards aren't taxed the way they have been. We have a pretty aggressive hiring plan in place, and we're looking to get some good, quality people on property. And when it's all said and done, ultimately I'd like to grow the business. We're at a perfect time in rail history to do so. I look at the infrastructure, especially in the Northeast, and it's aging. It's in dire need of some infrastructure improvements. And I believe not only Conrail but the rail industry itself is poised to handle those raw materials to get to these worksites to modernize, update and improve the infrastructure that is no doubt aging over the years. The average structure in the Northeast — it's not uncommon to have bridges that are upwards of a hundred years old and it's time to renew and replace and we're poised to make that happen. FREIGHTWAVES: What are some ways that Conrail is thinking of to enhance customer service? GORTON: I call it leading measures. … What did we do to get those cars there in a timely and efficient manner? It starts with the arrival of the trains and then the components to get those cars on appropriate locals going out. The time between touch and the flat switching yard, the hump yard. How quickly can we flip the crews from the classification yard out to the departure yard back in? Modernization of some of the equipment we have. How can we be more efficient to improve the customer experience? FREIGHTWAVES: What challenges do you see for Conrail and the freight rail industry in general? GORTON: I think the biggest challenge we have right now is getting people. Quality people on property. Not to make it a political discussion, but we have to make it enticing for people to walk away from the government subsidies they're getting and get them back into the workforce. … We have to have the right people apply for these jobs and get them on board. We are interviewing 200 to 300 people to get 20. We're trying to attract the right people to fit into this industry. FREIGHTWAVES: What opportunities do you see for Conrail and for the rail industry in general? GORTON: I think the opportunities are definitely in the intermodal business. It looks to me like a huge growth engine for the country. Not only for the Class IIIs but for the Class Is. If you look at the Amazons, the Costcos of the world — as they grow, so does the intermodal demand and I think it's a great problem to have. We have to make sure we have enough equipment to support that growth and the right people in place to move it. So, as I look across the entire network, including Union Pacific, which I just left, the focus on intermodal is crucial at this time. FREIGHTWAVES: Are there any challenges to meeting intermodal growth in the Northeast? GORTON: I would say the challenge is getting the right equipment in place to move it. You'll see what our owners are doing. You'll see them repositioning equipment to make sure they're protecting the outbound loads. … So, I would say the allocation of equipment and then meeting demand. … For the trucking industry, you've got to make sure they have the ample amount of chassis to do what they need to do locally to get them to the rail yards and out. So, I would say that the equipment is critical. FREIGHTWAVES: How is port congestion now? Has it improved since earlier this year? GORTON: It actually has. There is a great dwell initiative that's been happening at not only our major production yards but also at our terminal yards. We're striving for sub-20-hour dwell. You're seeing Oak Island Terminal in Newark hitting that on a regular basis, averaging about 20 hours of dwell, which is absolutely tremendous, which just opens up capacity for the inbound trains coming from our owners. FREIGHTWAVES: In addition to intermodal, what are other opportunities? GORTON: You're seeing growth in North Jersey and Staten Island [where] you'll see the containers of trash moved from the country. You're seeing the oil moving down from the North Dakota, South Dakota area coming off the CN — you're seeing that especially with the Phillips 66s of the world. You're seeing that type of growth. Even at the smaller ports. You look at the Port of Paulsboro in South Jersey — that has a tremendous growth opportunity as well. No matter where you look in the New York, New Jersey, North Jersey, South Jersey area, there's opportunity for growth, and I think we're in a great position to handle that. FREIGHTWAVES: Anything else you'd like to add? GORTON: I had an interview earlier today asking me how I feel about coming from a Class I to a Class III railroad. You look at Conrail and I don't see it as a Class III railroad. You look at the infrastructure that we have: We have the New Jersey Transit traversing our railroad, we have major terminals, we have major flat switching yards, we have a dispatching center. Everything you would see at a Class I that is housed right here in Conrail. So, it's operating on a Class I attitude or mentality. At Conrail, I believe we already have a Class I attitude and mentality and so I don't consider us as a Class III or a short line. I look at us as just as integrated into the business as any of the Class I railroads. So, it's pretty cool. I was pleased to see that upon my arrival. I couldn't be happier to be here. It's nice to be home. Subscribe to FreightWaves' e-newsletters and get the latest insights on freight right in your inbox. Click here for more FreightWaves articles by Joanna Marsh.

2021-06-10,Chemicals Shippers Relay Rail Service Woes To Regulators,"The American Chemistry Council (ACC) wants regulators to look into why chemicals shippers are experiencing rail service challenges throughout the U.S. and particularly within the Gulf Coast and Southeast. ACC President and CEO Chris Jahn sent a letter dated Tuesday to the Surface Transportation Board (STB) asking whether widespread and persistent rail service issues have been brought about by the railroads' efforts to cut costs and modify network operations. The letter didn't name precision scheduled railroading (PSR) specifically as a potential cause, although efforts in recent years to implement PSR through means such as sharply increasing demurrage and accessorial charges have stirred shippers' ire. Current rail service challenges are harming ACC member companies, disrupting supply chains, restricting manufacturing, increasing costs and preventing companies from meeting customer expectations, Jahn said. According to a member survey conducted by ACC, 93% of respondents said they have experienced rail service challenges within the past six months, with 86% saying they have had problems with CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), 57% saying they have had problems with Kansas City Southern's (NYSE:KSU) operations in the U.S. and Mexico, and 43% saying they have problems with Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). Although the service issues are widespread and have occurred on many Class I railroads, the major issues are concentrated in the Gulf Coast and Southeast, with issues at Atlanta; Mobile, Alabama; Jacksonville, Florida; and the New Orleans interchange with western carriers, according to Jahn. There have also been dwell times as high as eight to 10 days in Laredo, Texas, with Kansas City Southern. The issues include a lack of communication about network impacts, interchange delays, congestion, bunching, dwell times of over seven days, and local service failures. The problems have affected cross-border shipments between the U.S. and Mexico and delayed product delivery to customers in Asia, Europe, and South America. ACC asked STB to conduct enhanced oversight of CSX, saying the railroad hasn't been adequately prepared to meet customer demand or uphold past commitments. The Board should utilize its oversight authority to identify the root cause of CSX's service disruptions and assess the long-term impacts of operational changes on capacity and network resiliency, Jahn said. ACC also recommended four other steps for STB to take, including: Adopting an expedited process to provide alternate service options to groups of impacted shippers when a carrier is experiencing regional or systemwide service problems. Holding rail carriers responsible for service failures by allowing customers to recover damages for the additional cost of alternative service and compensation for lost production and/or sales. Encouraging or requiring carriers to suspend minimum volume commitments when a railroad is failing to provide reasonable service. Promoting greater rail-to-rail competition by moving forward with the board's long-standing exploration of reciprocal switching. U.S. railroads in 2020 transported 2.3 million carloads of chemicals and plastics, and that number could grow annually by nearly 200,000 carloads by 2030 amid the industry's investments to grow production capacity, according to Jahn. ACC sent another letter to the board in late May to express concerns about how potential mergers between Class I railroads might affect rail service.

2021-06-14,"Kansas City Southern, Norfolk Southern Announce Retirements, Appointments","Kansas City Southern's Chief Innovation Officer To Retire Brian Hancock, Kansas City Southern's (NYSE:KSU) chief innovation officer, will retire from Kansas City Southern (KCS) effective July 2, according to a company filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing did not indicate who would replace Hancock. It says Hancock will receive payments totaling $2 million through July 2 per an agreement between KCS and Hancock made last week. The agreement also includes standard noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions. Hancock has been with KCS since July 2015, according to a June 2019 FreightWaves article. He has held executive positions at Family Dollar Stores, Martin Brower, Whirlpool and Schneider National. Jason Morris To Succeed Scott Weaver At Norfolk Southern Jason Morris will take over as Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) vice president of labor relations, the railroad said last week. Morris succeeds Scott Weaver, who is retiring after serving Norfolk Southern (NS) for 32 years. Morris will start his role on Oct. 1 and will report to Annie Adams, executive vice president and chief transformation officer. Morris currently serves as assistant vice president for safety and environmental. Jason is an innovative and collaborative leader who will forge strong partnerships between management and labor in his new role, Adams said. As head of our safety and environmental team, he built a track record of bringing management and our craft workforce together to improve safety performance and culture. Jason Morris. (Photo: Norfolk Southern) Morris graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy and the University of Virginia School of Law, and he attended the executive development program at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. He began working in NS' legal department in 2010, where he handled safety, labor and employment issues. Adams said of Weaver, who started working in 1989 as a labor relations specialist before moving up the ranks, Scott's understanding of our business and ability to build relationships earned him the respect of colleagues, labor leadership, and peers across our industry.

2021-06-15,Dwindling Dwell: How Class I Railroads Are Addressing Supply Chain Congestion,"Improving train speeds and communicating more closely with the ports are some of the ways the Class I railroads are seeking to relieve the delays plaguing the freight supply chain, according to comments made by executives at recent investor conferences. The systemwide delays brought about by labor shortages, a lack of available equipment, and persistently elevated volumes are affecting drayage and warehousing operations, which in turn slow down the pace that the railroads can deliver goods. Alan Shaw, Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) chief marketing officer, said the lack of fluidity at the warehouses and for drayage has caused Norfolk Southern's (NS) street dwell on its chassis to increase by 20%. NS is seeking to increase its train speeds and work with terminal contractors to improve terminal fluidity, and it is looking at how it loads and its intermodal trains and whether it can improve efforts to double stack, according to Shaw. As fluidity improves with the drayage and warehouse communities, that will improve chassis street dwell, which then provides better turns on equipment, Shaw said. There are a number of things everyone in the supply chain ecosystem is focused on, Shaw said at a UBS investor conference last Tuesday. We're very, very fortunate to be aligned with the best channel partners in the business. … They know what to do with the interface with us and the BCOs, and we know what we need to do. The labor force participation rate within the supply chain is also low, Shaw said. Everyone is dealing with labor issues right now. Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) acknowledged that it has been applying significant surcharges on its container pool as a means to protect customers that have committed to a company program that seeks to ensure container availability. Although recent surcharges aren't as high as they've been, the higher rates point to strong demand, according to Kenny Rocker, Union Pacific's (UP) executive vice president for marketing and sales. Still, the one thing we would change if we could is the amount of dwell that's out there in the marketplace, Rocker said at last week's UBS conference. To improve system fluidity, UP has increased the number of trains and engaged with intermodal and domestic partners so that UP can make more at its terminals for containers that might not need to move as quickly. The more reliable and the more time we are making that box available, the better chance we have of that customer thinking of that box on a timely basis, said UP CFO Jennifer Hamann at the conference. And so, to the extent that they know a box availability is 10 a.m., and I can have a driver there at 10 a.m., that's going to be efficient for them. That's going to help the whole process. The railroad has also been talking with the ports to see how UP can help to reduce dwell, according to Rocker. We work with the ports pretty closely. I would say that they have reacted and put more resources in place, Rocker said. And so, you have seen the backlog or shifts that were out there, waiting to get in, which is encouraging. Longer-term, the ports should put additional resources to develop technology aimed at improving supply chain visibility for itself and its partners, including UP, according to Rocker. As the peak season approaches for retail and grain approaches in the second half of the year, issues with supply chain fluidity could persist through the end of this year. I think you can improve over that time period — absolutely. But my guess in terms of getting back to what I'll call ‘historical fluidity,' that's probably a few months off and probably not something next year, Hamann said. CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) acknowledged that its service metrics have been struggling this year amid increased demand for transportation services, not just for rail but also for trucks, CSX CEO Jim Foote said earlier this month. CSX's lower service metrics come amid concerns from chemicals shippers that service has been lagging in the Southeast and Gulf Coast. The American Chemistry Council recently expressed those concerns to the Surface Transportation Board. An influx in COVID cases in the late fall and early winter contributed to a higher number of employees being unavailable for work, which in turn affected CSX's terminal dwell and velocity, Foote said at the Bernstein investor conference on June 3. While CSX is experiencing a much lower COVID caseload and workforce availability is more stable, CSX has been hiring more employees to ensure adequate staffing levels for 2022 and 2023, according to Foote. At the Wolfe investor conference in May, CSX CFO Kevin Boone noted that CSX is getting ready for fall peak and adding and redistributing headcount to needed areas, such as in the Gulf. We want to be there when the volume comes, Boone said in May. Even though CSX has never shut down its intermodal terminals and it has the yard and terminal capacity to handle volumes, the challenges in securing chassis and finding drivers in the dray community have exacerbated delays in the supply chain, Foote said. We have to have a better relationship with that piece of the business, said Foote, talking about CSX's relationships with its channel partners, including international partners such as vessels and BCOs. It's a cultural change and a mindset change. CSX has also been communicating with the dray community more than we ever have before, Foote said. UP noted that it has been having challenges with the eastern portion of its network because there haven't been enough chassis available, Hamann said at the Wolfe investors conference in May. It's interesting times — challenging times — for everybody in the logistics business, Foote said. FreightWaves reported last Thursday that the number of empty containers leaving Chicago is up by 62% year-over-year, indicating the strong demand for empty containers to head back to the coastal ports and out to sea. But loaded containers coming out of Chicago are down by 4% in the same time frame, according to FreightWaves SONAR data. Meanwhile, both East and West Coast ports reported record volumes in May, and those high volumes could persist through the remainder of 2021. Those expectations come as the National Retail Federation (NRF) last week upped its forecast for retail sales to total between $4.44 trillion and $4.56 trillion in 2021, compared with an earlier forecast of $4.33 trillion made in February. We are seeing clear signs of a strong and resilient economy, NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz said in a release. Incoming data suggests that U.S. economic activity continues to expand rapidly, and we have seen impressive growth. Most indicators point toward an energetic expansion over the upcoming months and through the remainder of the year. Railroads Brace For Higher Volumes In Second Half Of 2021 Class I railroad executives expect continued strength for intermodal traffic and for commodities such as lumber and metals. The slow start of the year has not dampened our expectations, Hamann said. Grain volumes could also be strong in the second half of the year, although the railroads could be facing tougher year-over-year volume comparisons, according to UP's Rocker. The semiconductor shortage looks likely to persist and affect automotive volumes until the third quarter, but that timeline could change as the third quarter nears, executives said. We believe that we should get close to normalized sometime at the beginning of the third quarter, but that's still then kind of a wait-and-see scenario, Rocker said. Meanwhile, it will take one to two years for some chemicals and plastics production facilities to return to normalized inventory levels because of February's winter storms, Boone said last month. About 75% of those plants CSX serves experienced or were affected by supply shortages. It's a long, long path for them to replenish inventories, Boone said.

2021-07-02,CSX Resubmits Application To Acquire Pan Am Railways,"CSX has resubmitted its application to acquire New England short line Pan Am Railways, saying the new filing provides a more in-depth market analysis that federal regulators were seeking. The railroad is seeking to prove to regulators and existing and potential Pan Am customers how the acquisition would provide more modal options, including shifting more shipments from truck to rail in order to take advantage of environmental benefits, according to CSX (NASDAQ:CSX). The acquisition would benefit existing Pan Am customers, such as those shipping forest products, aggregates and sand, and particularly those that need to ship their goods over 500 miles to and from the New York market, CSX said. The acquisition would expand CSX's reach in Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts while adding Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine to its existing 23-state network, CSX said in a Friday release. The Surface Transportation Board didn't approve CSX's earlier application to acquire Pan Am, saying in a May 26 ruling that more details were needed about how Pan Am and its customers would be integrated into CSX's network. CSX says this revised application takes a deeper look into potential operational opportunities and growth projections that would come from an end-to-end, single line service. Adding Pan Am to our network will extend the reach of our service to a wider customer base over an expanded territory, creating new efficiencies and market prospects for customers to capitalize on a robust pipeline of growth opportunities to move freight to, from and within New England, CSX President and CEO Jim Foote said. Meanwhile, an end-to-end network means that there would be no overlap between the areas that CSX and Pan Am serve, meaning that CSX's and Pan Am's networks wouldn't be competing against each other. They're in New England. We serve a little bit of New England but not as much as they do. We have the rest of our network that they don't touch. If you look at a map and put us together, there's no overlap. We connect in one or two places in Massachusetts, and that's it, CSX spokeswoman Cindy Schild told FreightWaves. CSX said it is working on an agreement with Vermont Rail System to address that short line's concerns about a stretch of PanAm's line operated by PanAm Southern, a subsidiary of PanAm that is jointly owned by CSX and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). Vermont Rail System is concerned how its access to Pan Am Southern would be affected since Genesee & Wyoming would be the operator of Pan Am Southern and Vermont Rail Systems sees itself as one of G&W competitors. The railroad also said it has the support of numerous stakeholders in New England, as seen by the more than 80 letters of support from shippers, local businesses and local and state elected officials sent to STB. CSX plans to deploy more fuel-efficient equipment to the Pan Am network as part of a wider goal to upgrade and modernize the Pan Am system over the next five years and improve network fluidity there. Those benefits would extend to passenger rail, including Amtrak, which has come out with concerns about the acquisition. We have a longstanding history of working cooperatively with them. If anything, we have been hosting passenger service and commuter rail successfully for certainly a long time, Schild said. CSX's operational changes have also resulted in improving Amtrak's on-time performance metric to over 90%, she said. The railroad has also worked with public partners to expand passenger rail capacity in central and southern Massachusetts and around Boston. The Pan Am network consists of nearly 1,200 miles, while the Pan Am Southern system is more than 600 miles. The network accesses multiple ports and large-scale commodity producers in New England, CSX said. Pan Am remains excited about this merger with CSX, a North American leader in rail-based freight transportation, said David A. Fink, president of the North Billerica, Massachusetts-headquartered Pan Am. We have continued to receive support from our customers about the transaction as they know that CSX's investment in the region will benefit not only New England shippers but also those who will have new access to their goods and products through the direct connection into CSX's national rail network.

2021-07-08,June Carloads Reflect An Economy In 'Much Better Shape',"U.S. railroads reported that carloads and intermodal originations reached 2.56 million during June, up 14.5% year-over-year, according to weekly data provided by the Association of American Railroads (AAR). June carloads in the U.S. increased 19.1% year-over-year to 1.18 million with intermodal container and trailer volumes climbing 10.9% to 1.39 million. The year-over-year comparisons continue to benefit from severe declines in shipments a year ago as a result of COVID-related lockdowns and protocols, which hampered the heavy industrial segments of the economy. Chart: (SONAR: RTOTC.USA). To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, click here. Nineteen of the 20 commodity categories tracked by the AAR showed year-over-year increases in June. Coal (+33.5%), chemicals (+16%) and metallic ores (+164.6%) were some of the highlights. Farm products, excluding grain, fell 10.6% year-over-year during the month. Excluding coal, carloads increased 14.1% year-over-year during June. For years now, industry participants have viewed the data without coal, which remains in a longer-term secular decline due to prior changes in environmental regulations. The fossil fuel has seen a resurgence of late as renewable energy sources have been unable to keep up with surging demand amid economic expansion in many countries. U.S. rail volumes in the second quarter of 2021 reflect an economy that is in much better shape than it was but still has room to grow, said John Gray, SVP at AAR. In the second quarter, total U.S. carloads were the highest since the fourth quarter of 2019; carloads excluding coal were the highest since the third quarter of 2019; and intermodal and chemical volumes were both the highest for any quarter in history. For the second quarter, total U.S. rail traffic increased 23% year-over-year with total intermodal volumes up 22%. Inventory restocking continues to fuel intermodal shipments as retail stock levels struggle to keep pace with lingering high demand following record holiday buying last year. The latest retailers' inventory-to-sales ratio fell to 1.07x in April, a new low and significantly below pre-pandemic levels of 1.45x. Chart: (SONAR: ORAIL.USA) Even with port congestion, container and chassis shortages, and labor issues with both drivers and facility dock workers, inbound ocean shipments remain robust. All of these issues again negatively impacted velocity (-13%) and dwell time (+8%) on the four large U.S. Class I railroads during the quarter. However, the service comps are to the second quarter of 2020 (velocity +15%, dwell -9%), which was volume-starved and during which freight moved on the rails with ease. Total merchandise carloads were up 21% year-over-year in the quarter with motor vehicles (+90%) leading the way. The auto manufacturing industry felt the brunt of the pandemic in 2020 with widespread factory shutdowns during April and May. Railroad Earnings Estimates Tweaked Slightly Even with the big year-over-year jump in volumes during the quarter, carloads still came in slightly below the expectations of some. Bascome Majors, equity analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, reduced his second-quarter earnings estimates by low- to mid-single-digit percentages due to weaker-than-expected volumes, rising fuel costs and network congestion, which he said in an earnings preview to clients is leading to decreased volumes and slightly weaker operating leverage. He raised his forecast for Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) by 5% on better-than-expected volumes. The key to the rails' show-me story remains volume growth, since revenues must carry the load as more than a decade of profit growth led by pricing and PSR reaches maturity, Majors stated. Majors maintained a positive rating on Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Union Pacific and CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) as much of the cargo the rails haul will benefit from inflation and as labor costs, which most industries are struggling to contain, are tamped down through previously negotiated multiyear labor contracts. Majors said he's willing to capitalize extended valuations to gain exposure against an inflationary backdrop (rails move commodity/industrial products that benefit from inflation, but are protected on labor costs by union contracts). For the week ended last Saturday (week 26), total traffic on the U.S. railroads was up 17.1% year-over-year and 14.3% for all of North America at 685,398 units. Through the first half of 2021, total U.S. carloads were up 9.4% year-over-year to 6 million. Total intermodal containers and trailers were 17.5% higher at 7.33 million units.

2021-07-14,"CSX, NS, And Amtrak Spar Over Gulf Coast Service","Amtrak wants the Surface Transportation Board to expedite its review of Amtrak's plans to re-establish passenger rail service in the U.S. Gulf Coast. The service was discontinued in the mid-2000s. But CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) are saying, not so fast. The two freight rail carriers still want Amtrak to complete a comprehensive survey of how the passenger service would impact regional freight shipping operations. Amtrak seeks to start operating passenger rail service between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama, by Jan. 1, saying the service is an important piece of a national vision to make intercity passenger rail service a more vital part of the nation's transportation system. The residents of the Gulf Coast have already waited many years to have their passenger rail service restored such that this vision can become a reality, Amtrak said in a July 6 filing to the board. It is asking STB to institute a proceeding and use the procedural schedule that Amtrak proposed on March 16. Amtrak's proposed passenger rail service would use track and infrastructure owned by CSX and NS. According to Amtrak's filing, Amtrak has been working with CSX to allow Amtrak to (1) conduct a survey for an interim layover track in Mobile; (2) undertake repairs to stations in Bay St. Louis, Gulfport, Biloxi, Pascagoula, and Mobile; and (3) begin the process of qualifying Amtrak crews to operate along the Gulf Coast corridor. Amtrak can already access safety and operational information on lines owned by NS in New Orleans because Amtrak already operates on those lines, according to Amtrak's filing. But CSX and NS contend that Amtrak still needs to complete a study on how passenger service would impact freight rail service, especially on CSX's network in Alabama. They say the study would not only determine what additional infrastructure is needed, but would also help the board assess the environmental impacts of Amtrak's application. To dispel any confusion, a capacity study continues to be as necessary as it always has been. It is needed to determine what infrastructure is required to support adding passenger trains to the Gulf Coast corridor without unreasonably degrading freight service, attorneys for CSX and NS said in a Friday filing. They continued, Numerous freight stakeholders in Alabama have voiced their opposition to the ‘leap before you look' request by Amtrak, where passenger trains are forced onto the track without the benefit of the longstanding practice of a cooperative Amtrak-freight rail capacity study that has been requested by CSXT [CSX Transportation] and NS. CSXT and NS are not opposed to Amtrak's desire to bring new passenger service to the Gulf Coast, but it should be done the right way. The two railroads concluded that the board should dismiss Amtrak's request to expedite a review until Amtrak, CSX and NS complete an operations modeling study. Amtrak's request to reestablish Gulf Coast service comes as the Biden administration has been keen to invest in passenger rail, according to its proposed budget for the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as DOT's comments about Amtrak's efforts to restart Gulf Coast service. Encouraging the Surface Transportation Board to protect Amtrak's rights to use freight railroad tracks and prioritize passenger trains will provide more sustainable and equitable transportation options across America, Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn said last Friday in response to Biden's executive order targeting the maritime and rail industries. We appreciate the president's continued support for Amtrak's plans to bring passenger rail service to more of America. Separately, Amtrak announced last week plans to invest billions of dollars to replace aging rolling stock.

2021-07-26,"Port Of Savannah Sets Another Record, But Growth Seen Slowing","After reporting another record fiscal year of volume growth, the Port of Savannah's near-term encore is likely to be somewhat muted. The nation's fourth-busiest container port broke the 5 million twenty-foot equivalent unit barrier in its 2021 fiscal year, according to data published Monday by the Georgia Ports Authority, the state agency that runs the container port, the Port of Brunswick, a bulk, breakbulk, and roll-on, roll-off facility for vehicles, and an inland port facility in Chatsworth, Georgia, in the state's northwest corner. Savannah handled 5.3 million TEUs in the period ending June 30, shattering the previous record set the year before by nearly 900,000 TEUs, according to GPA data. The 20% year-on-year gain at the Port of Savannah replicated the percentage increase from FY 2019 to FY 2020, GPA said. Brunswick reported its second-best year on record after FY 2015. The back-to-back volume surges mean that for now at least, the law of large numbers has caught up with the container port. We are not expecting massive growth this [fiscal] year, Griff Lynch, GPA's executive director, said in an interview on Friday. Lynch said he will be happy if Savannah maintains its current level of throughput through the rest of the year. The growth performance of the past two fiscal years can't be sustained, especially with ships and berthing terminals already full, he said. It's going to be tough to top what we just did, Lynch said. The port's success means it is bumping up against box throughput constraints. In 2018, it unveiled a 10-year plan to boost capacity to 10 million TEUs from about 5.5 million TEUs. GPA's multiple expansion projects are geared toward that goal. A $250 million project set to be finished in 2023 will transform one of Savannah's berths from one that handles small ships to one capable of servicing an 18,500-TEU vessel, Lynch said. A second terminal under construction west of GPA's bulwark Garden City terminal will add 750,000 TEUs of capacity, he said. Combined with 650,000 TEUs to be brought online by the end of 2021, GPA expects to add 1.4 million TEUs over the next two years. The multi-year effort to deepen Savannah's historically shallow harbor to 47 feet from 42 feet is expected to be finished by the end of 2021, GPA said. When completed, the harbor will have a depth of 54 feet at high tide, meaning bigger ships can take on even heavier loads without any tidal constraints, GPA said. GPA's Mason Mega Rail project, which enables CSX Corp. (NYSE:CSX) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC), the two Eastern Class I railroads serving the port, to run trains from Garden City as far west as St. Louis, is expected to be completed by mid-2022. Rail volumes in FY 2021 rose to 550,000 lifts — each lift equals one transfer between a crane and a railcar — an increase of about 12%. By the end of 2021, the port authority will commission the building of nine new tracks, it said. The project will generate 2 million lifts per year at full working capacity, the port said. A second inland port, located in Hall County northeast of Atlanta, is expected to be completed in 2024, Lynch said. Container shortages have plagued the maritime supply chain since the middle of 2020 when volumes unexpectedly began to surge following the pandemic-related lockdowns of the spring. Today, Savannah has about 30,000 available containers for export, Lynch said. The port is also handling a lot more empty containers than it has in the past, he said. Savannah is the leading U.S. port for export traffic. Because of that, it has maintained a near-equal balance of imports and exports. However, the spike in import traffic has thrown that equation out of kilter. Lynch estimated that imports account for 60% of Savannah's traffic, compared with 52% during what would be considered normal times. Image by Claudia Peters from Pixabay"
2021-07-26,Mobile Terminal Touts Import Access To Coveted Midwest Destinations,"APM Terminals Mobile in Alabama is putting a spotlight on its freight rail capacity to handle imported goods from the Gulf Coast to Chicago and other popular Midwestern destinations. The reminder comes as supply chains are grappling with congestion at Chicago as stakeholders seek to reduce the backlog of imports coming from West Coast ports into the city, long a popular distribution hub linking Western and Eastern rail networks. The terminal is part of A.P. Moller-Maersk. APM says it has access to five Class I railroads that have daily departures to the Midwest, and it has five Asia/U.S. liner services calling at the Port of Mobile. We're trying to help alleviate Midwest supply chain pressures for customers. Ocean carriers are looking for more gateway options into the Midwest market. We've got berth space available and 35 moves per hour per crane berth productivity, said APM Terminals Managing Director Brian Harold. Our rail product is a consistent performer that can handle much more volume. The near-dock rail yard allows seamless ship-to-rail transfer, he said. Among the service offerings are CN's (NYSE:CNI) 2.5-day direct doublestack service and northbound refrigerated packs for cold chain cargoes, according to the terminal. The terminal has an on-dock rail facility that consists of two operating tracks, a loop track, and a car repair track. The five Class I railroads serving the terminal are CN, CSX (NASDAQ:CSX), Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), and BNSF (NYSE:BRKB). For customers looking to transload Midwest cargo or deliver containers to local distribution centers, APM Terminals Mobile has an average waiting time to enter the terminal for truckers of seven minutes with a total turn time of 51 minutes once in the terminal. 81% of the truck moves at APM Terminals Mobile are dual moves (where a trucker is bringing in a container for drop-off and picking up a container for delivery) which generates optimal supply chain flow, the terminal said in a release on Monday. APM Terminals seeks to become a 1.5 million-TEU port, compared with 2019 volumes of 419,000 TEUs, according to its website. A container berth expansion in March 2020, a container yard expansion in November 2019 and an expanded truck gate in 2020 are all projects APM Terminals hopes will support that goal. Meanwhile, the Alabama State Port Authority plans to deepen the Mobile harbor to accommodate larger vessels.

2021-07-27,June US Class I Rail Headcount Flat Even As Volumes Grow,"June employment levels at the U.S. operations of the Class I railroads were roughly flat with May, growing 0.8% amid a 21% growth in U.S. rail volumes. Headcount at Class I U.S. rail operations totaled 115,931 employees in June, according to data submitted to the Surface Transportation Board. That's a 0.37% increase from May but a 0.17% decrease from June 2020. The slight increase between May and June comes as the U.S. Class I railroads originated 2.56 million carloads and intermodal units in June, compared with nearly 2.12 million carloads and intermodal units in May, according to the Association of American Railroads. (Surface Transportation Board) Staffing levels for the train-and-engine (T&E) category rose between May and June, reflecting the increase in volumes between the two months. The T&E category typically is more sensitive to changes in market demand, and an increase in rail volumes could translate into a greater need for T&E crews. June 2021 headcount for the T&E category was 47,444 employees, a 0.85% increase from May and an 11.54% rise from June 2020. The category with the largest percentage decline year-over-year was the maintenance of equipment and stores. That category totaled 17,659 employees, an 11.64% drop from June 2020 and a 0.42% decline between May and June 2021.

The fluctuations in employment within the U.S. Class I railroads come as the railroads are still adjusting their operations, both to better align with the principles of precision scheduled railroading (PSR) and to add more network capacity as demand for rail service increases. Indeed, in response to its long-term business plan, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) closed some shops in Pennsylvania in July. The closures included the Cresson engine house, where NS will cease mechanical operations. Seven positions will be eliminated there. NS also furloughed 86 employees from the mechanical department in the Juniata/Altoona area. We appreciate the hard work and commitment of all the men and women on the Thoroughbred Team and will work with furloughed employees on opportunities to apply for open positions elsewhere in our system, NS said. These announcements are part of our long-term business plans to evolve our operations to best serve the needs of our customers. We remain committed to the region and serving the needs of our customers, the railroad said. But the railroads are also looking to hire additional employees to match headcount with network capacity and rising demand for rail service. Plans to hire additional employees have been made for places where there is less of an available labor pool. CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) said last week that it is seeking to add more train conductors to its roster to smooth out service.

2021-08-02,Return on Capital Employed Insights for Norfolk Southern,"After pulling data from Benzinga Pro it seems like during Q2, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) earned $1.17 billion, a 14.98% increase from the preceding quarter. Norfolk Southern also posted a total of $2.80 billion in sales, a 7.65% increase since Q1. Norfolk Southern earned $1.01 billion, and sales totaled $2.60 billion in Q1. What Is Return On Capital Employed? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, Norfolk Southern posted an ROCE of 0.08%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. Return on Capital Employed is an important measurement of efficiency and a useful tool when comparing companies that operate in the same industry. A relatively high ROCE indicates a company may be generating profits that can be reinvested into more capital, leading to higher returns and growing EPS for shareholders. For Norfolk Southern, the return on capital employed ratio shows the number of assets can actually help the company achieve higher returns, an important note investors will take into account when gauging the payoff from long-term financing strategies. Upcoming Earnings Estimate Norfolk Southern reported Q2 earnings per share at $3.28/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.94/share."
2021-08-05,Norfolk Southern Train Carrying New Vehicles Derails In Missouri,"A Norfolk Southern train carrying new vehicles derailed on Monday in Huntington, Missouri, causing NS to stop train traffic there for over a day. The derailment involved an eastbound NS (NYSE:NSC) train. At just before 1:30 p.m. local time, 48 railcars derailed. No injuries were reported. NS closed that stretch of track to train traffic but reopened it early Wednesday morning after personnel and contractors made repairs to the track and cleared cars, according to NS. The cause is still under investigation. (Photo: Missouri State Highway Patrol) The train was carrying new vehicles, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's Twitter feed. Those new vehicles reportedly included Ford F-150 trucks, according to various media reports. A Ford spokesperson said the company is looking into the incident but declined to provide details.

2021-08-09,"Wabtec Modernizes 1,000th Locomotive","Wabtec has modernized its 1,000th locomotive in North and South America, the rail equipment manufacturer noted on Friday. Wabtec (NYSE:WAB) says rehabilitating older locomotives has resulted in up to a 25% increase in fuel efficiency, a more than 40% increase in reliability, up to a 55% increase in haulage ability and up to a 20% reduction in maintenance, repair and overhaul costs. By making older locomotives more fuel-efficient, the 1,000 locomotives have reduced their carbon emissions by more than 1.4 million tons since 2015. An equivalent reduction would be removing the emissions from 340,000 cars, according to Wabtec. The modernization program has been a tremendous success and has created a new segment in the market. It is now a key pillar of fleet management strategies for many railroads, said Pascal Schweitzer, president of Wabtec Freight Services. That is a tribute to our employees, suppliers and customers. From product development to industrialization, their support was essential in making this service such a success in the market. The company delivered the latest modernized locomotives to Norfolk Southern, the company said Friday. NS (NYSE:NSC) accounts for 500 of the 1,000 locomotives that Wabtec has modernized, according to Wabtec. A before and after look at Norfolk Southern locomotives at Wabtec's locomotive plant on Friday in Forth Worth, Texas. (Brandon Wade/AP Images for Wabtec) As a leading transportation provider, it is our responsibility to reduce our environmental impact, said Tom Schnautz, NS vice president for advanced train control. Our partnership with Wabtec is one way we plan to achieve our target of a 42% reduction in emissions intensity by 2034. Wabtec's program is maximizing the value of our locomotives, lowering operating costs and reducing emissions. Wabtec's modernization program entails reusing a locomotive's existing steel via requalification and remanufacturing process. This process reduces emissions. More than half of a locomotive's critical components are reused, rebuilt or remanufactured at least three times over their useful life, Wabtec said. The company conducts the modernization program at locomotive plants in Erie, Pennsylvania; Fort Worth, Texas; and Contagem, Brazil.

2021-08-09,Federal Regulators To Review Amtrak's Request To Restore Gulf Coast Service,"The Surface Transportation Board has determined that it will review Amtrak's request to restore Gulf Coast service, dismissing calls by Class I railroads CSX and Norfolk Southern to deny the request because of concerns about how the passenger rail service might affect freight rail operations. Amtrak wants to run passenger trains between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama. But the service would run on lines owned by CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) and NS (NYSE:NSC), and both railroads, along with the Port of Mobile and a number of Alabama shippers, had wanted a study completed beforehand to assess how the passenger rail service would affect freight rail and port operations. The STB's decision on Friday institutes a proceeding for evaluating Amtrak's request, as well as sets a procedural schedule. The decision also appoints an administrative law judge to resolve initially all discovery disputes. According to the procedural schedule, CSX, NS and Amtrak will be filing material to the agency by certain dates in October, November and December. By Dec. 16, the last date given, there will be a proposal on the hearing format. Amtrak thanks the Surface Transportation Board for its decision to dismiss CSX and NS' attempt to block Gulf Coast passenger rail service. This upholds Amtrak's right to petition the Board for rail access and sets a schedule for a transparent process that will produce an outcome by the end of this year, Amtrak said Friday. In the meantime, Amtrak is working with the Southern Rail Commission to take steps to begin to operate Gulf Coast Service as soon as possible next year, Amtrak said. In response to the decision, CSX said, CSX is evaluating the decision, but will plan to move forward with the schedule established by the STB. Amtrak previously ran long-distance passenger service three days a week east of New Orleans, including the stretch between New Orleans and Mobile. But Hurricane Katrina in 2005 caused significant damage to the rail infrastructure, ending the service. CSX and NS had wanted Amtrak to complete an operational impacts study that the three had started in January 2020. However, the study wasn't completed because Amtrak elected in January 2021 not to continue its involvement, contending that several past studies had already looked at the operational impacts and that public funding was at stake. STB denied CSX's and NS' wish to deny Amtrak's request for a proceeding because the proceeding is ripe for adjudication, plus Amtrak's application won't need environmental and historic reports as required by some applications seeking federal approval. For several years, Amtrak has sought to restore service in some manner on the Gulf Coast, and it is unclear how the parties will reach an agreement regarding service on the Gulf Coast without Board consideration of Amtrak's application, STB said. The agency also said that Amtrak doesn't need to finish the January 2020 study. But the board will accept into the record any studies related to how freight rail operations would be impacted by Gulf Coast service. By including more studies into the proceeding's record, as well as information from all the parties on what infrastructure might be needed to support Amtrak service, STB will be able to consider the concerns of Alabama groups and officials about how Amtrak service would affect operations at the port. The Board recognizes the importance of a study that models — in the context of the line's present and future traffic volumes and engineering design and conditions — the specific service that Amtrak proposes in its application, STB said. The Board therefore expects that evidence on the service's potential effects on freight transportation, such as an RTC [rail traffic controller] study or other study or studies, will be part of the record in this proceeding, as well as any competing studies or other competing evidence, together with all the inputs, assumptions, and methodologies underlying any study results, including all relevant traffic projections (filed under seal, if necessary). STB continued, As part of this effort, the Board also expects the parties will detail any infrastructure that they consider necessary for Amtrak to operate additional trains by its proposed start date as well as infrastructure needed in the future to factor in anticipated growth in traffic. The information described above will allow the Board to assess whether the proposed additional train service can proceed without impairing unreasonably freight transportation. The Board recognizes the concerns expressed by Alabama state leadership and some railroad and port entities, among others, regarding the potential impacts of passenger service on freight service in the New Orleans-Mobile corridor and the need for a study to assess those impacts and identify mitigation measures. However, as explained above, this proceeding, including evidence submitted by the parties, will provide a forum to assess precisely the matter of concern to Alabama state officials and others. Friday's decision follows a request by the U.S. Department of Justice to take up the issue. Also, while Alabama officials have raised concerns about the restoration of Gulf Coast service, officials in Mississippi and Louisiana have been vocal in their support of Amtrak.

2021-08-10,US Class I Railroads To Feds: Don't Blame Us,"Much of the congestion occurring at intermodal rail terminals are ultimately related to factors beyond the control of the Class I railroads, and the railroads are doing all that they can to improve terminal throughput, assert the CEOs of U.S.-based Class I railroads to the Surface Transportation Board. The board had asked the Class I railroads in July to explain what they were doing to address the congestion occurring at intermodal terminals. STB also asked the railroads to describe how and when they assess demurrage when containers aren't being picked. The railroads defended their responses, saying that although they do what they can to move containers out more quickly, the challenges facing other supply chain stakeholders — factors such as chassis and driver availability and labor shortages to support unloading at distribution centers — are affecting the railroads' ability to move containers in and out of terminals in a timely fashion. Clearing our network will take some time, and it will require the cooperation of all stakeholders of the supply chain. Clearing the congestion and keeping the network fluid will be vital non-railroad improvements to the inadequate takeaway capacity at our ramps that is the root cause of the congestion, said Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) President and CEO Lance Fritz in a Thursday response to the board. We are working hard to help our customers understand the problem and improve their operations. Fritz continued, Shippers and receivers are responsible for their decisions to overextend their capacity in shipping and receiving, which congests the supply chain. This overextension is beyond our control. CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) President and CEO Jim Foote echoed similar sentiments in his Aug. 2 letter to the board. We work hard to optimize the movement of freight over our railroad and at the terminal, but we cannot be held accountable for the informed and calibrated decisions shippers are making to ship and that receivers are making as to their capability to receive. Nor can we be held responsible for the inefficiencies that exist in other parts of the supply chain, Foote said. Rail intermodal terminals are not designed for, and are not physically capable of, long-term container storage for significant volume, Foote said. He explained that the throughput capacity of an intermodal terminal depends on the ability of receivers and steamship lines to maintain a relatively consistent flow of freight in and out of the terminal. CSX has also sought to maintain open gates at its terminals and repositioned containers to off-site container yards when possible, Foote said. The railroad also communicates with East Coast ports daily to gauge current and projected flows, and it has engaged with customers on container dwell, he said. BNSF President and CEO Katie Farmer said the backlogs at BNSF's (NYSE:BRK) intermodal terminals can also be seen on other places on BNSF's network, such as staging as many as 30 trains, holding around 7,500 containers, outside intermodal facilities because there isn't enough space in BNSF's hubs to get containers unloaded for pickup until the appropriate party coordinates the pickup of older containers for delivery to processing locations. We do believe that there is enough physical capacity present across the national supply chain to handle the current volumes, Farmer said in her response to the board last Wednesday. She noted that BNSF has moved significantly more intermodal containers and trailers in 2021 than it did during the intermodal industry peak year of 2018. The amount of chassis, port and rail terminal capacity, rail equipment and employee resources is sufficient to handle the current volumes, but only if all parts of the supply chain do their part. Operating 24/7 in all parts of the supply chain, not just rail, would generate substantial capacity immediately, Farmer continued. Like the other Class I railroads, BNSF has been applying escalating storage fees to customers that take a long time to pick up their containers. The railroads say the fees are a way to encourage customers to move out their containers more quickly. As a railroad carrying containers between points where we are not the origination or the final destination of a load, BNSF has relatively few options to maintain the fluidity of our intermodal terminals if containers are not picked up by customers on a timely basis, Farmer said. Unless BNSF can utilize the few tools we have available to incentivize timely pickup – including storage charges when containers are left in our yards beyond free time – rail operations will degrade and ultimately come to a halt. … Our collective customers benefit as well when there is accountability across all users for effective management of resource use across the supply chain. The increased demand we face makes it imperative for us and our customers that we implement those reasonable accountability measures to support fluidity and maximum utility of rail capacity. The Class I railroads also said they would rather have smoother and more efficient terminal throughputs in the first place than assess demurrage. Consistent with KCS' policy of preferring to work with customers to avoid storage, rather than collecting storage fees, we have also been flexible with the application of storage charges, where warranted, said Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) President and CEO Pat Ottensmeyer in an Aug. 3 response to the board. On assessing storage fees, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) President and CEO Jim Squires said in his Friday response: The purpose of Norfolk Southern's storage fee policies is to encourage prompt retrieval of shipments once they have arrived at one of our intermodal facilities. Our terminals are not designed or intended for extended storage or warehousing. Delays in pulling containers from our terminals results in congestion, which impacts the fluidity of our operations and the level of service we are able to provide to our intermodal customers. To ease congestion at its international intermodal terminals, NS has taken measures such as metering traffic at origin to keep the flow of containers to inland destination terminals consistent with the ability of the drayage and warehouse communities to pull from those terminals, increasing the flow of inbound containers as outgate capacity improves, Squires said. Other modifications have included making changes and upgrades to NS' Chicago terminal to increased stacked container capacity by 60% and lift capacity by 40%; working with the Western railroads to create steel-wheel interchanges in Chicago, alleviating pressure on the drayage community for cross-town interchanges; and developing an incentive program that rewards customers who achieve at least 50% ‘dual missions' (that is, bringing one container out for every container brought in) at our Chicago and Kansas City terminals, which will encourage greater efficiency and help relieve pressure on driver availability and chassis supply, Squires said. Midwest rail congestion affecting West Coast container flows: Maersk The responses by the Class I railroads to STB come as ocean carrier Maersk said Friday that rail congestion in the Midwest is affecting container flows to and from U.S. West Coast ports. In a Friday customer advisory, Maersk said the congestion in hubs such as Chicago and Memphis is causing some major disruptions, with rail import dwell at Long Beach extending beyond eight days on average because fewer trips are heading back to the West Coast from the Midwest hubs. The rail congestion is limiting customers' ability to return empty containers, compounding a broader container shortage, Maersk said.

2021-08-13,"Norfolk Southern To Reopen Intermodal Facility In Greencastle, Pennsylvania","Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) plans to reopen its intermodal facility in Greencastle, Pennsylvania. Greencastle facility, which was opened in January 2013 as part of the Crescent Corridor initiative, was idled in 2019 for business reasons. Norfolk Southern expects the added capacity at Greencastle to reduce terminal congestion and improve network fluidity across Pennsylvania. The Greencastle terminal has the capacity for an estimated 100,000 shipping container lifts annually. The first phase of traffic at Greencastle is expected to generate around 50,000 lifts. Effective Sept. 10, the railroad plans a gradual phase-in of business at the Franklin County Regional Intermodal Facility. Price Action: NSC shares are trading lower by 0.02% at $268.95 on the last check Friday."
2021-08-23,Peak Season: Let The Chaos Commence,"Freight markets have entered their second year of extreme dislocation, brought on by record consumer spending and a transportation network that doesn't have the labor or equipment to fill the need. A lack of openings on ocean sailing schedules, ships waiting longer to berth at the ports, and delays unloading the freight once it has landed are some of the front-end issues facing the transportation industry. Once freight is routed inland, a chicken-and-egg scenario is playing out between container/chassis scarcity and slow rail service, with each causing further detriment to the other. Add in labor headwinds throughout all phases of the supply chain, notably difficulties finding truck drivers and warehouse workers, and the storm for freight delivery is near perfect. Inventory Pull Forward Pushing Inbound Containers To New Highs The National Retail Federation said earlier this month inbound twenty-foot equivalent units would again break a recently established monthly record. The group is calling for August TEUs to increase 12.6% year-over-year at the nation's largest retail container ports to 2.37 million, which would surpass the record just set in May. August is the beginning of the ‘peak season,' when retailers stock up on holiday merchandise each year, the report stated. Many retailers are moving up their shipments this year as part of their risk-mitigation strategies to ensure that sufficient inventory will be available during the holidays. FreightWaves data shows inbound ocean bookings are accelerating again. Chart: (SONAR: IOTI.CHNUSA). Ocean bookings to the U.S., measured as a 10-day-moving average of volume being tendered with ocean carriers and freight forwarders, are forward-looking and provide insight into volumes before they depart a port of origin. To learn more about FreightWaves SONAR, click here. The NRF expects full-year 2021 TEUs of 25.9 million, 17.5% higher year-over-year and a new record. Monthly volumes are expected to remain above the 2 million-unit level for the rest of the year, continuously stepping lower from the August prediction to 2.02 million by December. However, loaded imports came in lower than expected in July at the Port of Los Angeles due to congestion. Loaded inbound TEUs of 469,361 were light of the port's expectation of 516,000. The port's executive director, Gene Seroka, pointed to warehouses filled beyond capacity, maxed out rail yards and difficulties finding chassis and containers as the culprits for the shortfall. Both anchorage and dwell times are trending in the wrong direction, Seroka said. Seventy-five percent of ships stopped at anchor in July [instead of heading to berth], up from 50% in June. Early data for August shows that 90% of arriving vessels are headed straight to the parking lot. Photo: Dwell time hits new record at Port of Los Angeles (Jim Allen/FreightWaves) As recently as mid-August, 125 ships were either at berth or anchor (including 37 container ships) at the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports, which was an all-time high. Seroka's update showed dwell time at container terminals was at peak levels (5.3 days), and street dwell time at the warehouses was near peak (8.3 days). Seroka estimates that for each one-day increase in dwell time, an additional 3,500 chassis are required. He is calling for the port to handle a total of 950,000 TEUs in August, compared to 890,800 in July. Total TEUs are expected to step down to 880,000 in September with the full year producing 10.5 million in total throughput, a 14% increase from 2020. The cargo forecast remains strong through the balance of this year. This year's peak [season] looks a lot like it has over the last 12 months: unrelenting consumer demand, imports competing for space and empties across the board, Seroka said. Container imports at the nation's 10 largest ports increased 14.3% year-over-year in July, according to The McCown Report. July traffic was also up 12.3% compared to July 2019, a subdued but more normal freight market. The NRF reported that retail container imports increased 35.6% year-over-year to 12.8 million TEUs during the first half of 2021. The bloated growth comp benefited from a sharp decline in freight demand at the pandemic's onset as many sectors of the economy shut down or operated at reduced output levels for months. Chart: (SONAR: CSTM.USA). The seven-day moving average of customs data shows the robust year-over-year comps recorded over the past year are flattening as the container surge that started last August is lapped. Railroads dispute claims that poor service is tied to PSR On the surface transportation side, many of the supply chain's woes have been laid at the feet of the railroads. The railroads, however, are pushing back on the narrative. At the Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) 2021 Transportation Conference, management from Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) told investors that in addition to a huge influx of containers landing on the West Coast, a lack of capacity in the terminals was the reason for service issues. Jennifer Hamann, EVP and CFO, pointed to things beyond our network like shortages of drivers and chassis as the culprits behind trains being delayed. Dray capacity is still an issue, Hamann said. That very much is an issue on the international side in particular, but to a lesser extent on the domestic side. I would say the domestic issue … is more the chassis. She pointed to roughly 2,000 containers still stuck in stacks because UP doesn't have the chassis needed to put them into service. In July, the railroad suspended international container movements from West Coast ports headed inbound to Chicago for one week to allow the network time to catch up. BNSF Railway (NYSE:BRK) also made a similar decision to limit traffic. Chart: (SONAR: IRAILINTL.CHI). Total loaded inbound international rail container volume to Chicago. At his monthly press conference, Seroka said UP had 25 miles of trains and BNSF had 22 miles of trains sitting outside of facilities near Chicago at the time of the service pauses. He also noted that rail dwell time at the Port of Los Angeles has worsened to more than 13 days, which is a record. UP's intermodal volumes are down 5% year-over-year in the third quarter and down sequentially from the second quarter as well. Hamann said declines in parcels from an e-commerce surge a year ago are hurting the comp. UP began recalling crews this year when volumes improved, but July Surface Transportation Board employment stats show the railroad's employee count was down 2.8% year-over-year in the latest month. The company ended the second quarter with just north of 30,000 full-time employees, its lowest number of FTEs in the last 15 years, and well off the 42,000 mark recorded in 2018. By comparison, average weekly volumes are down just mid-single digits compared to a 28% reduction in headcount over the same period. Chart: (SONAR: RAILSPEEDINT.UNP) In addition to volume declines, precision scheduled railroading and other efficiency initiatives have been the primary driver of the labor reduction. Management expects headcount to remain near current levels and said as volumes come back, it will add employees but not on a one-to-one basis. Hamann said the objective is to build the most efficient rail network in North America while growing volumes. She said PSR efforts are not to blame for declining service on the railroads, noting that key performance indicators like miles per car and the percentage of boxes and cars arriving on time have actually seen mid-single-digit percentage increases from two years ago. PSR is going to support our ability to do those things, not hinder them, Hamann added. The company's current guidance calls for 7% volume growth in 2021. Declines in recent weeks (total third-quarter volumes flat year-over-year but down mid-single digits sequentially) are clouding the path to the target. Improving auto production and agricultural shipments as well as improving intermodal fluidity are expected to bridge the gap in the coming weeks. Rail service issues are far from isolated to UP and the West Coast. Significant equipment and labor headwinds have been seen in the East Coast ports of New York and New Jersey as well as Savannah, Georgia, resulting in growing queues of late. Railroads have been diverting containers to inland intermodal terminals in efforts to increase capacity and address the congestion. In a separate appearance at the Deutsche conference, management from Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) said a repair program in place to address a defect on approximately 1,500 chassis has only exacerbated intermodal equipment shortages. The company will have 75% of the repair work done by the end of August and said it plans to begin taking delivery of an additional 1,100 chassis at the beginning of the year to address the shortfall. The railroad was later than others to adopt a PSR initiative. However, since the launch of its TOP21 operating plan in the third quarter of 2019, it too has leveraged headcount. Gross ton miles per employee have increased 22% in that time. Chart: (SONAR: RAILSPEEDINT.NSC) J.B. Hunt Is Hopeful For Improvement But Not Guiding To It J.B. Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT) plans to take delivery of 3,000 to 4,000 intermodal containers during the third quarter (12,000 in total over time) to ease network congestion. However, the fix is unlikely to be meaningfully impactful in the near term. Asked at the same conference if intermodal loads could be flat year-over-year during the third quarter, Brad Delco, VP of finance and investor relations, provided some caution. He said the midquarter additions would only add approximately 8,200 loads (assuming the recent monthly run rate of 1.65 loads per container) to the 500,000 it handled during the second quarter. Compare that to a year ago [530,000 loads], flat may be a little bit optimistic, Delco added. Overall intermodal volumes on the U.S. Class I railroads are flat year-over-year so far in the third quarter, down 6% sequentially. Chart: (SONAR: RTOIC.USA). Rail traffic originated by intermodal containers. Delco said J.B. Hunt had 70% of its intermodal customer contracts repriced at the end of the second quarter and that the entire book of business will be repriced by the end of the third quarter. He said the rate increases should be reflected on roughly 85% of its intermodal business this quarter, which will drive revenue per load higher again. The metric was up 15% year-over-year in the second quarter. But as intermodal pricing steps higher, so have the costs associated with operating a network stressed by overwhelming demand and prolonged delays. J.B. Hunt has been enforcing assessorial charges more strictly on customers that are turning boxes too slowly. But Delco said there has been little evidence that the fees are working, as some customers are turning containers quicker while others have fallen further behind. Earlier in the year, the company guided to sequential quarterly margin improvement in the segment as rate increases take hold. J.B. Hunt achieved that goal in the first two quarters of the year. Delco said intermodal margins should continue to improve as revenue per load increases. But cost inflation presents some headwinds as extra miles are being driven by extra drivers to reposition equipment and meet the company's commitments to customers. Congestion is still bad, still hard attracting and retaining drivers, Delco said. I could tell you pricing is going to get better, but our costs are also going to get more challenging and how that shakes out will ultimately determine where margins shake out for Q3. The market is ripe for intermodal conversion. High fuel prices, extremely tight truck capacity and sky-high truckload rates would typically have shippers fleeing truck markets in favor of rail. But the opposite is occurring as the intermodal complex remains bogged down. We're going to have more containers, we're still working with customers and we're still working with the rails to get better fluidity, Delco said. Chart: (SONAR: IMCSIF.USA).

2021-08-30,"Ida's Impact: Latest Supply Chain Updates, Monday, Aug. 30","Monday's news on Hurricane Ida and its impact on various sectors of the freight industry from reports by the FreightWaves reporters and market experts. This file will be updated throughout the day as more news comes in, so please check back. 10:22 a.m. ET: Kansas City Southern suspends operations, interchanges KCS (NYSE:KSU) suspended mainline operations and interchanges from New Orleans to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as well as Gulfport/Hattiesburg, Mississippi, because of excessive rain and wind caused by Hurricane Ida. Once KCS reopens its lines in these areas, it will send out another update. The railroad said it is continuing to monitor the storm's projected path and potential impact on the rest of KCS' network. Until the water has receded sufficiently, maintenance cannot yet begin. Crews are on location and will begin making the necessary assessments and repairs once the all-clear has been received, KCS said. Meanwhile, Norfolk Southern said Sunday that its New Orleans intermodal facility would be closed Monday. The facility is expected to resume normal operations on Tuesday, and NS will provide updates as conditions change. Customers with shipments arriving or departing from the New Orleans facility should expect delays of at least 24 hours, NS (NYSE:NSC) said. — Joanna Marsh 9:30 a.m. ET: Soybean shippers expect export impact Soybean shippers are bracing for potential export impacts stemming from Hurricane Ida. The lower Mississippi River is by far the largest export region for soybeans and corn, representing 61% of U.S. soybean exports and 58% of U.S. corn exports, according to Soy Transportation Coalition Executive Director Mike Steenhoek. As a result, any lengthy disruption to export activity in this key region warrants our attention and concern, he said Sunday. According to Steenhoek, 464,138 metric tons (18.3 million bushels) of corn, 141,859 metric tons (5.2 million bushels) of soybeans, and 71,696 metric tons (2.6 million bushels) of wheat were exported from the terminals along the lower Mississippi River for the week ending Aug. 19. Also during that timeframe, 487 barges of grain were unloaded. — Joanna Marsh 8:06 a.m. ET: Spot rates on Atlanta-New Orleans lane Spot rates on the Atlanta-New Olreans lane will surge as hurricane relief efforts tighten capacity in Atlanta, and saturate the New Orleans market. Dry van rejection rates increased to 25.14% on the ATL-MSY lane ahead of Hurricane Ida, but inbound tender rejection rates have jumped to 39.72% for the New Orleans market. Dry van outbound tender rejection rates jumped to 25.35% in New Orleans this past weekend as outbound freight volumes increased to 54.69 index points. New Orleans shippers extended tender lead times to 3.21 days as spot rates climbed in the market the last few days as capacity tightened before the impact of Hurricane Ida. – Zach Strickland 8 a.m. ET: Expect capacity to tighten across the nation The damage from a Category 4 hurricane could bring widespread destruction from winds, flooding and tornadoes, which will tighten capacity all across the nation from relief efforts on both the state and federal levels. Companies large and small will be hauling water, ice, food, medical supplies, generators, wood, roofing materials, MREs, cots, etc. into the areas in and around the New Orleans market. Thousands of loads will be picked up out of the FEMA warehouses in the Dallas and Atlanta markets, and supplies from military bases across the South and East Coast. — Zach Strickland MORE COVERAGE OF HURRICANE IDA Craig Fuller: Will Hurricane Ida cause carriers to chase FEMA relief loads?

2021-09-02,"Stakeholders Detail Worries, Support On CSX Plan To Acquire Pan Am Railways","Ensuring competitive access and fortifying passenger rail service are two of the goals that stakeholders want the Surface Transportation Board to achieve as it mulls CSX's proposed acquisition of New England short line Pan Am Railways. Opponents and skeptics about the acquisition want STB to make CSX (NASDAQ:CSX) fulfill a number of conditions as part of its approval — if the board approves the application at all — according to their recent filings. Canadian Pacific is seeking to preserve the Hoosac Tunnel, located in western Massachusetts and owned by Pan Am Southern (PAS), a subsidiary of Pan Am Railways. The tunnel route serves as a gateway to PAS' western gateways, including the Mechanicsville Gateway with CP (NYSE:CP), and it provides what CP says is the only viable competitive alternative to CSX for most New England rail traffic, according to a filing submitted by CP's attorneys and James Clements, CP SVP of strategic planning and technology transformation. CP expressed concern that CSX, which would be a part-owner of the tunnel with Norfolk Southern if the acquisition is approved, would not have an incentive to maintain the tunnel because it competes against CSX single-line routes. Furthermore, the acquisition calls for a significant portion of the Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) traffic supporting the tunnel route to be diverted to the CSX route under the CSX-NS settlement agreement over PAS, which would reduce NS' incentives to support the continued viability of the tunnel route, CP said. CP also said the appointment of Genesee & Wyoming as the third-party operator of PAS would not ensure the line's competitive viability because G&W has conflicting interests in New England as an operator of a number of short-line railroads in the region. CP wants STB to ensure that the owners of the Hoosac Tunnel and the route sufficiently invest in the upkeep of the tunnel and related infrastructure, as well as require that PAS provide service levels that would promote competition within the region. The Transaction marks a fundamental restructuring of the competitive incentives relating to the entirety of the New England rail map, CP said. The Board should proceed with great caution here, and condition the Transaction in a way that preserves the long-run incentives of the various parties to invest in and operate PAS's Hoosac Tunnel Route as a no-less viable competitive alternative than it would have been absent the Transaction. The U.S. Department of Transportation and the Federal Railroad Administration also weighed in on CSX's proposed acquisition of Pan Am Railways, saying that although DOT doesn't take a position on the transaction, it wanted to highlight issues that are of particular interest to DOT. Those issues include safety assurances, enhanced competitive options, and the upholding of access to commuter rail and Amtrak, as President Joe Biden wants many of those issues examined, per his executive order in July. DOT recognizes the efforts that the applicants have made to identify competition concerns and to propose remedies and solutions, particularly to help alleviate any potential adverse effects upon shippers and other stakeholders. These include arrangements to preserve specified rates and services at current levels, subject to certain conditions, DOT said in a filing on Friday. We also appreciate the applicants' efforts to work collaboratively with stakeholders to anticipate and address their concerns. Nonetheless, DOT urges the Board to examine these issues carefully in its review of the proposed transaction, consistent with the principles set forth in [Biden's executive order that mentions the rail industry], and should ensure that the promised public benefits of the transaction will actually be achieved if the proposal is approved, DOT said. Vermont Attorney General Thomas J. Donovan Jr. said STB should deny CSX's application unless the board can apply a condition that would allow a freight carrier besides CSX and G&W access to gateways and corridors in and out of Vermont. Vermont's Agency of Transportation respectfully requests the Board to deny the Application as proposed. CSX and its partners have presented a web of transactions that will compromise Vermont's existing position, in which it benefits from true competition among rail providers, Donovan said. In accordance with the Board's precedent, if an applicant fails to propose a means of mitigating the effects of a 2-to-1 reduction in service, the proposed merger transaction must be rejected. Alternatively, the Board should impose a condition to protect competition at gateways and corridors that are key to the movement of traffic to and from Vermont by requiring a carrier that is completely independent of both Applicants and their corporate affiliates, and of [G&W] and its numerous corporate affiliates, to have the right and ability to serve those gateways and corridors, Donovan said. Meanwhile, Amtrak said it wants assurances that CSX will maintain and upgrade the existing infrastructure. The merger is one in which passenger trains account for the majority of trains operating on many of the involved rail lines, Amtrak said, and so as a result, public funding — not private investments like those of Class I railroads to their own networks — provides the capital for the maintenance and upkeep of these lines. Since the late 1990s, there has been an enormous investment of public money in the just over 1,000 miles of rail lines owned and/or operated by Pan Am. The majority of this funding was provided to support initiation or improvement of state-supported Amtrak services, Amtrak said. Furthermore, the board should ensure that the acquisition wouldn't result in deteriorating passenger rail service, Amtrak said. Past railroad consolidations that have been approved without enforceable conditions for the protection of passenger rail have triggered service meltdowns that produced daily, multi-hour delays to Amtrak trains for extended periods, with inevitable declines in on-time performance (‘OTP') and ridership that have often taken years to recover, if at all; while deterioration in track conditions has jeopardized the continued operation of Amtrak trains, Amtrak said. As some stakeholders raised concerns over the proposed acquisition, CSX says it has received more than 100 pro-merger comments from stakeholders, including Maine Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins, the Connecticut Department of Transportation, and the Northern New England Passenger Rail Association (NNEPRA). This transaction and the physical and operational improvements CSX has indicated it will make, has the potential not only to sustain and enhance the safe operation of passenger and freight rail service in Maine and New Hampshire but also to preserve and protect the substantial financial investments which have enabled NNEPRA and its partners to achieve success to date and set the stage for even greater economic opportunities and public benefits in the future, CSX quoted NNEPRA Executive Director Patricia Quinn as saying.

2021-09-22,"STB Keeps Busy With Mergers, Last-Mile Data, Reciprocal Switching","As the Surface Transportation Board considers the proposed merger between Kansas City Southern and Canadian Pacific, on the forefront of stakeholders' minds will be how the two will transition their operations to serve one network, according to two transportation attorneys speaking at FTR's virtual conference last week. The KCS-CP merger is one of many issues that could keep board members busy through the end of this year and into the next. Stakeholders will be watching how KCS (NYSE:KSU) and CP (NYSE:CP) plan to keep the gateways open on commercially reasonable terms, how labor will react to the merger and how the railroads will adjust their tariff or rail rate structures, said Michael F. McBride, a partner at Van Ness Feldman who has represented rail shippers such as The Chlorine Institute. Fellow panelist William Mullins, who is a partner at Baker & Muller and provides legal counsel to KCS and Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), said there are pledges put already in place by STB that require KCS not to use its market power in Laredo, Texas, a gateway that competitor Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) also services. These pledges are there following KCS' merger with Texas Mexican Railway. Although STB has granted CP and KCS to apply for a merger under less strict pre-2001 rules governing Class I railroad mergers, CP and KCS are mindful of today's market environment and, as a result, are preparing to submit an application in mid-late October that would reflect the old rules on steroids, Mullins said. Another deal that stakeholders will be watching for operational impacts will be CSX's proposed acquisition of New England short line railroad Pan Am Railways. The board's decision to convert the proposed merger from a minor transaction to a significant one shows rail observers that the current board makeup is one that is comfortable with ruling with a regulatory hand, according to Mullins. McBride countered that the board may have been right in assessing the CSX-Pan Am merger as significant because STB is perceiving some broader operations implications regionally and to Amtrak service. How heavy-handed should the board be? As STB grapples with a number of long-standing issues, the board should maintain its reluctance to order other rail carriers to take over another rail carrier's service, Mullins said. As a whole, the board should avoid issuing specific orders about rail service and instead should suggest mediation or more disclosure of service metrics, Mullins said. When it comes to whether STB should require the Class I railroads to supply additional data on first-mile and last-mile movements, one question that should be addressed is the usefulness of the data and whether it would be worth the railroads' time and effort to collect that data, Mullins said. Shippers also should be careful what they ask for because the data could reveal situations in which shippers might have problems with loading and unloading or holding railcars for storage, he said. It will be incumbent upon shippers to show how first-mile and last-mile data can be useful in forming appropriate service remedies, McBride said. Reciprocal switching is another contentious issue within the rail industry. The railroads suggest the measure would result in creating operational problems, while shippers contend that the procedure could encourage more competition. Reciprocal switching is when a captive shipper requests service from a competing railroad at an interchange. You won't see dramatic changes in how the railroads would operate … but [it could result in] a more level playing field as shippers negotiate for better rates or service at the interchange, McBride said. Mullins said, To all of a sudden impose [reciprocal switching] without any commitments in investing in infrastructure … would be a disaster for the shippers. Meanwhile, STB must also grapple with how to respond to President Joe Biden's executive order asking the STB chairman to consider how the board's actions might encourage freight rail competition. Since STB is not a member of the executive branch, it has no legal obligation to comply with an executive order, Mullins said. While STB Chairman Marty Oberman has said he's supportive of the executive order, the board still must issue orders upon facts and the law, he said. But while the board is not required to comply with the executive order, the chairman of the board serves at the pleasure of the president, and Oberman may do what he can to address long-standing issues, McBride said.

2021-10-05,Unions Allege Norfolk Southern Job Cuts Saddled Engineers With Other Duties,"Two rail unions are alleging that Norfolk Southern has trimmed its workforce so deeply as a result of precision scheduled railroading (PSR) that it is now forcing some locomotive engineers to perform duties as conductors and brakemen. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) and the Transportation Division of the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, and Transportation Workers (SMART-TD) have filed lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, claiming NS violated the Railway Labor Act. The lawsuits, filed Thursday, contend that NS (NYSE:NSC) has been forcing engineers represented by BLET to work in conductor assignments. BLET says NS is unfairly taking advantage of a clause in the 2015 collective bargaining agreement related to workforce scheduling, according to a court filing. Conductors and brakemen are represented by SMART-TD. In announcing the lawsuits, SMART-TD and BLET said NS has been willfully depleting its workforce and using locomotive engineers to fill the responsibilities left open by departing conductors and brakemen. The shortage of conductors and brakemen is so severe that NS started ordering locomotive engineers — under threat of termination for insubordination — to work conductor positions even though both the BLET Agreement and the SMART-TD Agreement prohibit the use of locomotive engineers in train service positions, said SMART-TD President Jeremy Ferguson and BLET National President Daniel Pierce in a joint statement. Today, our unions have initiated legal actions that are intended to compel NS to follow our contracts and obey the laws of our land, they continued. NS cannot lawfully lay off roughly 4,000 conductors and brakemen, and then give their work to another craft. Nor can NS lawfully deprive locomotive engineers of the jobs, wages, and working conditions to which they are contractually entitled by forcing them to perform the work of other crafts. The unions said NS' deployment of PSR, an operational model that seeks to streamline operations, contributed to NS' efforts to eliminate jobs. Because of PSR, NS has eliminated the jobs of over 35% of its operating crew members since December 2018. NS also has been fighting since the summer of 2019 to cut the size of operating crews by half, Ferguson and Pierce said. In response to a request for a statement, NS said it doesn't comment on pending and ongoing lawsuits. According to employee headcount data that NS has supplied to the Surface Transportation Board, the number of employees who belong to the train and engine category has fallen 33% over the past five years, from 11,186 in September 2016 to 7,461 in August 2021. The train and engine category includes locomotive engineers, train conductors, and brakemen, according to the Federal Railroad Administration.

2021-10-06,Norfolk Southern Reopens Kentucky Intermodal Terminal,"Norfolk Southern has reopened an intermodal terminal serving Louisville, Kentucky, in light of strong growth in the intermodal market there. NS (NYSE:NSC) reopened the terminal in Buechel, Kentucky, on Monday. The terminal will be open only for inbound traffic coming from the Norfolk International Terminals in Virginia and the Portsmouth APM Terminals at the Virginia International Gateway in Norfolk. The reopening will add terminal capacity to the growing Louisville market, NS said Sept. 29. The reopening of the terminal follows other recent efforts to reopen terminals in the Midwest. In August, NS reopened a South Central intermodal facility, while BNSF (NYSE: BRK-B) reopened a terminal serving the Memphis, Tennessee, area.

2021-10-13,September Container Volumes Near 2021 Highs at Port of Virginia,"The Port of Virginia in Norfolk handled more than 306,000 twenty-foot equivalent units in September, the third month in 2021 that volumes exceeded 300,000. September volumes rose 19% year-over-year and were just under the more than 307,000 TEUs handled in August, the Virginia Port Authority said Tuesday. The highest total for 2021 so far occurred in May, when the port handled 315,000 TEUs. Notably, loaded imports grew 26% to more than 152,000 TEUs year-over-year, while exports of empty containers rose nearly 23% to more than 70,900 TEUs. August and September's increases come as three-vessel services — Maersk's TP20, Hapag-Lloyd and CMA CGM's Indamex 2, and MSC's Indus 2, made their first U.S. East Coast port calls, according to the port. The growth we're seeing is not artificial, and the movement of loaded and empty containers is up, for both exports and imports, said Stephen A. Edwards, Virginia Port Authority CEO and executive director. Last September is when volumes began coming back, and since then we have posted growth each month. The operation is fluid and the Virginia Model of being an operating port, where we own, lease and operate all of the assets, allows us to be agile in meeting the needs of our customers and cargo owners. Edwards continued: There is no congestion here and ocean carriers and cargo owners are taking notice of our track record and what we are doing to ensure consistency in our operation. We are maintaining our efficiency and service levels because we are monitoring the operation so closely and continuing to add modern assets. The result is that they are choosing Virginia because they see value here. All transport modes experienced year-over-year volume increases in September. The number of truck containers handled rose 25% to 110,452 TEUs, while barge containers rose over 9% to 7,141, although barge containers handled at the Richmond Marine Terminal fell nearly 41% year-over-year and 15% since August, to 2,495 TEUs. The terminal handles containers, temperature-controlled containers, break-bulk, bulk and neo-bulk cargo. The number of rail containers handled rose 16% to 53,405 TEUs, although containers handled at the Virginia Inland Port at Front Royal fell 31% year-over-year and 18% since August, to 2,297 TEUs. The Virginia Inland Port, which is served by Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC), is 60 miles west of Washington and enhances service to Washington and Baltimore. The port also handled 13% fewer vehicle units in September, with a volume totaling 318 units. The port expects volumes to remain elevated through the end of the year, with year-to-date volumes in September up 30% to 2.58 million TEUs. We may see a dip as the retail season comes to its end, but this is normal and any fall-off in volumes will be small, Edwards said. Looking into 2022 we see nothing that leads us to believe that there is going to be a drop in volumes. It is going to take some time before the supply chain returns to normal.

2021-10-15,The Perils of Precision Scheduled Railroading,"Although almost all of the Class I railroads have been deploying precision scheduled railroading (PSR), an operational model that seeks to streamline operations, for several years already, a number of issues keep the debate over its value alive. The railroads have argued that PSR provides shippers with consistent and reliable service. Proponents of PSR contend that shippers previously had to wait until a train was long enough in order for them to receive service, making service more erratic. Having that stability helps freight rail become more trucklike, they say. Implementing PSR has also helped the railroads lower their operating ratio, a gauge derived by a formula that helps investors determine the financial health of a company. But the unions representing craft employees and train and engine crews — the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, SMART-TD, Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO, the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes, among others — generally have been skeptical of PSR, in large part because the operational model also seeks to cut costs, and one way to cut costs is to reduce employee headcount. Since 2016, the yearly average of those employed by the U.S. operations of the Class I railroads has fallen roughly 25%, according to data submitted to the Surface Transportation Board. The yearly average of the total number of employees working for the U.S. operations of the Class I railroads. The 2021 average is through June. The rail unions argue that PSR's emphasis on adhering to a strict train schedule jeopardizes the ability of workers such as signal maintainers and carmen from doing a thorough inspection. They also argue that the job cuts have been too deep, resulting in a freight rail industry that doesn't have enough network capacity for when rail volumes grow or when congestion issues arise in the supply chain. They want to run the leanest railroad they could possibly run to produce historic operating revenues to entice investors, said a freight rail policy expert with one of the unions. But the railroads are running themselves so lean that they are only capable of the railroad of today. They are not capable of running railroads when there are economic shocks or changes in shipping patterns. Union members also believe that rail derailments, such as the September fatal derailment involving an Amtrak train running on track owned by BNSF (NYSE: BRK-B), have increased in recent years. According to the Federal Railroad Administration, most derailments occur within the confines of rail yards and not on mainline track.

The agreement will address wages, benefits and health care, and workplace safety and operating rules, according to the Association of American Railroads, the trade group representing the Class I railroads. Below are some thoughts about PSR from two union members who argue that PSR is squeezing employees' abilities to perform their roles fully. ‘We all know that things aren't getting done' Randy has been working as a signal maintainer for a Class I railroad for nine years. His full name hasn't been disclosed in order to protect his identity. As a signal maintainer, Randy conducts monthly and quarterly inspections of the signals at railroad crossings and at other areas within his assigned territory. The inspections involve adhering to standards developed by the FRA. When Randy first started, the railroad treated him and his colleagues well. Everything was great. I really can't say enough good things about how they treated us in the beginning, Randy said. Things started to change when his railroad implemented PSR, according to Randy. One of the biggest changes has been the declining number of employees working for the railroad, coupled with greater responsibilities for each remaining worker. The territory that each signal maintainer was responsible for grew, while the managers overseeing the work of the signal maintainers are also responsible for ensuring that a greater amount of territory is being properly inspected, according to Randy. Another change is PSR's impact on the timing of the inspections, according to Randy. Because the trains run on a fixed schedule, the dispatchers are reluctant to give the signal maintainers the time they need to conduct a thorough inspection because they don't want to delay the trains. Meanwhile, the signal maintainers feel pressure to get all their inspections completed, Randy said. When you stretch them thin, in my eyes … a lot of those maintainers are going up to those gates and saying, ‘It was working fine the last time. Let me just write the paperwork up.' Because you just ain't got time to get it all done, Randy said. We all know that things aren't getting done. Randy believes that the railroads will start to hire more employees again because they need more crews to ensure that tracks and the network are functioning well. I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt, railroads that are running PSR — it's just a matter of time before the track is in such disrepair that they just don't have a choice but to hire more people and start going back. … Me personally, I just see PSR as a temporary thing because it just can't work, Randy said. When a train that weighs 20,000 tons is running across the rail, it's going to break stuff eventually. ‘Many things go undetected and it's starting to show' Jason Cox says he sees a lot of deferred maintenance occurring among the Class I railroads as a result of PSR. Cox, who has 25 years of railroad experience, started his career with Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) in 1998. After being furloughed there, he worked for CSX (NASDAQ:CSX). Now he works full time for the union as a general chairman for the Brotherhood of Railway Carmen. Carmen are those who inspect and repair railcars. Cox says the deferred maintenance comes from the railroads' decision to shutter multiple inspection points in order to streamline their operations and gain efficiencies. But closing those inspection points means that railcars are running longer miles between inspections. Furthermore, some railcars are being inspected by train crews besides carmen, and those crews aren't trained to inspect to the standard that a carman has been trained, according to Cox. Many things go undetected and it's starting to show, Cox said. Cox argues that carmen aren't given enough time to inspect the railcars because of the drive to keep the trains' schedule. Inspectors used to take up to three minutes per freight car but have now been encouraged to take one minute per car, according to Cox. That time includes the amount of time to walk around the equipment, he said. Cox also says there is a growing emphasis on focusing on certain elements of the inspection, such as inspecting the couplers that connect railcars together. While inspectors should examine that, the time constraints prevent them from thoroughly examining safety appliances such as ladders and crosswalks. This practice endangers railroad workers, he says. I think they need [to give] their employees the time to safely inspect this equipment. I believe that the inspections that they're relying on from train crews who are not trained to the standard of the carman [should] be returned back to the carman because they're the ones who are highly trained and highly specialized, and they're able to make the determination on the condition of these cars, Cox said. The condensed inspection time frame is resulting in employee burnout, Cox said. Furthermore, since there are fewer workers inspecting the cars, that means that the remaining carmen have more work to do and more overtime to complete. And as the need for network capacity grows, so does the workload, Cox said. The volunteers for overtime are completely burnt out that they cannot work any more overtime, and now the railroads are forcing overtime, Cox said. Members have submitted reports to me that they're so tired that they worry [about] getting killed or missing a major defect. What could help carmen and help the railroads improve safety practices is to reactivate inspection points so that they can go back to the repair shops soon, according to Cox. He believes that allowing time for a quality inspection to find defects will result in people wanting to come back after they've been furloughed. The utilization of technology should also enhance inspectors' safety practices, not replace the efforts of inspectors, according to Cox. The evolution of technology in large part has been good for the railroads [but] they want to use the technology to keep the status quo. … Technology should not supplant — it should work with [people] to allow it to do what it was designed to do, [which is] make the railroad safer, Cox said.

2021-10-18,"Earnings Season Continues with State Street, Albertsons, and Sandvik Announcing on Monday Morning","Stocks appear to be pausing as rates start to rise. Before the U.S. markets opened, short-term U.S. Treasury yields were rising. The five-year yields rose to their highest levels in 20 months per Reuters. The rise appears to be driven by hedge funds increasing their bearish positions on two- and five-year Treasuries while increasing their bullish positions on the 10-year Treasuries. The Financial Times reported that the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned that the BoE may have to start raising rates to curb inflation. While he gave no indication when rate hikes could happen, the English bond markets appear to be pricing in a hike in early 2022. Crude oil (/CL) is testing the $83 level as it looks to add to its streak of eight straight weeks of gains. The commodity ended last week 3% higher. Rising oil price may pull interest rates even higher. Looking at the stock market news, online real estate company Zillow (NASDAQ:ZG) is trading 6.1% lower in premarket trading. The company told Bloomberg that it won’t purchase homes for the rest of the year because it’s “beyond operational capacity”. In the previous few years, the company moved beyond reporting housing prices and started buying and selling or “flipping” homes. The company claimed “overwhelming” demand is prompting the stoppage. In other negative news, Disney (NYSE:DIS) fell 1.74% in premarket trading after Barclays cut its rating on the stock. Barclays analyst cited significant slowing as the reason for the downgrade. French biotech company Valneva (EPA: VLA) shot up 39% before the open on its claim that their COVID-19 vaccine candidate outperformed AstraZeneca’s (NASDAQ:AZN) in its Phase 3 study. Meanwhile, Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA) is trading lower after the FDA delayed a decision to make their vaccine available to adolescents. In earnings news, State Street (NYSE:STT) picked up where some of the other Financial stocks left off last week, by announcing better than expected earnings and revenue. Grocery chain Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) rose 5% in premarket trading after beating analysts’ estimates on revenue and earnings. The company also increased its dividend by two cents per share. Industrials stock Sandvik (OTC:SDVKY) also beat analysts’ estimates on both top and bottom line numbers. Sandvik is up more than 2% before the open. Retailing the Story On Friday, the September U.S. Retail Sales report was much stronger than expected. However, the stock futures reaction to the number was muted. On the other hand, the bond market did react, and the 10-year Treasury Yield (TNX) rallied more than 2.8%. Stronger sales are a good sign for economic growth, but part of the gains can be attributed to inflation. The report focuses on nominal numbers and didn’t adjust for inflation, so using the report as a measure of demand is a little distorted. Many economists would like to see weaker retail sales and a consumer shift to services. Weaker retail sales could alleviate some of the pressure on cramped supply chain and labor shortages. Stores could then restock their shelves, and manufacturers could replenish their inventories. A more fluid supply chain could provide a clearer picture on what inflation is transitory and what is more permanent. Either way, inflation continues to be an important factor driving the markets, which is one reason that Energy, Materials, and Financials sectors have performed so well. These groups may continue to do well if supply chains, worker shortages, and energy crises in Europe and China fester. CHART OF THE DAY: UPSIDE DOWN. The S&P 500 (SPX—candlesticks) appears to have completed the final shoulder of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. The pattern is considered by technical analysts to be bullish. Data source: ICE, S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Head Over Heels: I’m not much of a technical analyst, and I don’t even try to play one when I’m on TV. What I do have are friends that like to analyze charts, and some see an inverse head and shoulders forming in the S&P 500 (SPX). With a little imagination you can see it in the chart. The first shoulder formed near the end of September. Then the head formed around the first of October with the lower low. The last shoulder just recently completed when a higher low formed on October 13, and the price broke the 4450 “neckline” a couple of days later. Many technicians will use the distance from the bottom of the head to the neckline and then add that number to the neckline to create a short-term price target. There are a couple of issues with this and with every pattern. First, not every pattern breakout works. The security doesn’t always reach its target, or it just consolidates. In this specific case, the SPX must clear resistance at the 4530 level before it can reach its target. Also, price patterns are open to interpretation. You could ask several technicians about a pattern and likely get several answers on where to draw the lines or set the target. But many people find value in these patterns when trying to project future growth. Personally, I just feel bad for the guy hanging upside down. Industrial Strength: One sector that keeps hanging around is Industrials. The strength in the Energy and Materials sectors means more drilling, mining, and hauling of natural resources. That is hard work that is easier and faster when done with heavy equipment. The Industrial Select Sector Index ($IXI) has rallied more than 5.6% off its September low and is gaining in relative strength against the S&P 500. On next week’s earnings calendar, some of the larger industrial stocks that are scheduled to report include Sandvik (OTC:SDVKY), Vinci (OTC:VCISY), and Atlas (OTC:ATLCY). You may not recognize these names because each of these are based outside of the U.S. Industrial stocks that may have more name recognition include Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), which is scheduled to report October 28; Terex Corporation (NYSE:TEX), which reports October 29, and Deere (NYSE:DE), which reports November 24. Keep on Trucking: The Dow Jones Transportation Average ($DJT) traded above the 15,000 level to reach June 2021 prices. The group appears to have rallied on better-than-expected earnings from JB Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT) last Friday. Hunt rallied to a new 52-week high after climbing more than 10% on the day. A convoy of trucking stocks fell in behind Hunt including Old Dominion Freight (NASDAQ:ODFL), PAM Transportation (NASDAQ:PTSI), SAIA (NASDAQ:SAIA), Daseke (NASDAQ:DSKE), and Covenant (NASDAQ:CVLG). It wasn’t just trucking that benefited from Hunt’s success—railroads like CSX (NYSE:CSX), GATX (NYSE:GATX), Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU), Norfolk (NYSE:NSC), and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) all rallied on the day. As earning season progresses and the focus moves on from the Financials, the companies that can help solve the supply chain issues will likely attract more attention. As Charles Dow observed many years ago, a strong Transportation sector is usually a sign of strong economy. TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only. Member SIPC.

2021-10-28,BofA Upgrades Norfolk Southern On Prospects Of Sustainable Margins,"While Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) is continuing with its strategic overhaul, which it initiated in 2018, the improvements are “now palpable and are accelerating,” according to BofA Securities. The Norfolk Southern Analyst: Ken Hoexter upgraded the rating for Norfolk Southern from Neutral to Buy, while raising the price target from $287.02 to $325. The Norfolk Southern Thesis: The company’s premier intermodal franchise is likely to allow it to gain share in the tight truck market, Hoexter said in the upgrade note. “Chief Marketing Officer Alan Shaw has driven the Yield Up strategy mantra into sustained market-based pricing while operating efficiency continues to improve rail performance,” he mentioned. “Norfolk Southern posted 3Q21 EPS of $3.06, up 22% year-year, above our $2.77 target and Street’s $2.91. The company’s Yield Up strategy (market pricing) led to average revenue per car gains of +14%, above our 10% target, on flat carloads. Those gains enabled it to post a 60.2% operating ratio, 200 bps better than our target and a 230 bps improvement year-over-year,” the analyst wrote. “We believe NS is set to move operation ratio into the ’50s (we target 59% in 2022 and 58% in 2023), which should drive sustainable double-digit EPS growth despite current soft volumes,” he added.

2022-01-21,A Look Into Norfolk Southern's Price Over Earnings,"Looking into the current session, Norfolk Southern Inc. (NYSE:NSC) is trading at $274.17, after a 1.81% decrease. Over the past month, the stock decreased by 5.95%, but over the past year, it actually went up by 11.47%. With questionable short-term performance like this, and great long-term performance, long-term shareholders might want to start looking into the company's price-to-earnings ratio. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for shareholders trying to capitalize on the higher share price. The stock is currently below from its 52 week high by 8.36%. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Compared to the aggregate P/E ratio of 20.89 in the Road & Rail industry, Norfolk Southern Inc. has a higher P/E ratio of 24.03. Shareholders might be inclined to think that Norfolk Southern Inc. might perform better than its industry group. It's also possible that the stock is overvalued. There are many limitations to price to earnings ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings."

2022-03-30,"6 Best Transportation Stocks To Buy Right Now: FedEx, UPS And More","Airlines and cruise line stocks have had an extremely volatile couple of years since the pandemic completely shut down global travel back in 2020. Travel industries still haven't recovered to their pre-pandemic levels. In addition, ongoing supply chain issues have created extreme volatility in transportation prices among railroad, trucking and freight stocks. As the economic recovery continues, some transportation and logistics companies are perfectly-positioned to benefit, while others may continue to struggle to gain back lost business. Now is an excellent time for investors to bet on the return of transportation, but they need to be selective. Here are six of the best transportation stocks to buy, according to Bank of America. United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) United Parcel Service is a global package delivery company that also provides air and ocean forwarding, customs brokerage, and truck freight services. Analyst Ken Hoexter says UPS provides investors access to the massive global e-commerce market and has a growing 2.7% dividend yield. The company is focused on pricing, e-commerce and global sourcing, and Hoexter says its network transformation should help it improve its cost structure and mitigate margin compression from e-commerce growth over time. Hoexter projects 5.5% EPS growth in 2022. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $243 price target for UPS stock, according to Benzinga Pro. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) Union Pacific operates the second largest U.S. railroad network, with approximately 32,000 miles of track in the western U.S. In the past decade, Union Pacific has improved its operating ratio from the mid-80s to the upper 50s, Hoexter says. As a result, the company has generated sustained earnings growth in the upper teens percentage range. The company has adopted precision scheduled railroading, which has significantly improved its efficiency. Union Pacific hopes to reach a 55.5% operating ratio in 2022, down from 58.5% in 2020. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $277 price target for UNP stock. CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) CSX operates a U.S. network of about 20,000 railroad route miles in the eastern U.S., transporting raw materials, intermediate and finished goods, and intermodal containers. Hoexter says CSX continues to refine its precision scheduled railroading model implemented by former CEO Hunter Harrison and advanced by current CEO Jim Foote. As it continues to cut costs, Hoexter says CSX should experience earnings multiple expansion and transition to volume growth.

Bank of America has a Buy rating and $55 price target for LUV stock."
2022-04-14,Will Chart Analysts Notice Bad Omen on Norfolk Southern's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Norfolk Southern, which is trading around $263.87 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at Norfolk Southern's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q4 2021 Q3 2021 Q2 2021 Q1 2021 EPS Estimate 3.04 2.91 2.94 2.54 EPS Actual 3.12 3.06 3.28 2.66 Revenue Estimate 2.83B 2.75B 2.74B 2.62B Revenue Actual 2.85B 2.85B 2.80B 2.60B Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2022-04-28,Norfolk Southern's Return On Capital Employed Overview,"Pulled from Benzinga Pro data, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) showed a loss in earnings since Q4, totaling $703.00 million. Sales, on the other hand, increased by 1.68% to $2.90 billion during Q1. In Q4, Norfolk Southern earned $760.00 million and total sales reached $2.85 billion. What Is ROCE? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q1, Norfolk Southern posted an ROCE of 0.05%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Norfolk Southern is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. For Norfolk Southern, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.05% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Analyst Predictions Norfolk Southern reported Q1 earnings per share at $2.93/share, which beat analyst predictions of $2.92/share.

2022-07-16,Why Stifel Analysts Upgraded These Rail Stocks To A Buy: 'It Shouldn't Be As Bad As 2006-2009',"CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) traded higher on Friday after Stifel upgraded the two companies from a Hold rating to a Buy rating. In the recent industry report, Benjamin Nolan analyzed the current state of American railways and offered insight on recessionary trends as compared to the 2008-2009 Great Recession. CSX shed 9.19% of its value in June, and 18.74% in the last six months; while NSC lost 6.06% in June, and 17.54% in the last six months — vs. the S&P 500 which shed 7.19%, and 16.03% respectively — Nolan still finds value in the current context. Rail stocks have been re-rated and are now trading at significantly more attractive multiples in comparison to previously predicted earnings power, Nolan said. “However, moving into a softer macroeconomic environment and perhaps a recession, the volumes, prices, and ultimately earnings and cash flows of the rails could be impacted,” Nolan writes, “However, relative to previous cycles, we believe rails should be better insulated as persistently higher fuel prices should enable share gains over trucking. In addition, rails should capture share on currently underutilized carload business being impacted by supply chain congestion.” Also Read: Mark Cuban Reveals Why Bill Gates Hasn't Talked to Him Since This Moment However, insulated is not immune. Even while rails are now dealing with rising wages and regulatory costs, Nolan thinks that if the U.S. enters a recession, the effects on the railways will be relatively minor. “It shouldn't be as bad as 2006-2009,” he said. When carloads ceded to trucking as part of the PSR process were taken into account, the real impact of the crisis of 2008–2009 was more like an 11–12% fall in rail traffic from 2006 levels. Additionally, P/E multiples decreased to 9x from an average of 19x over the previous 10 years. During the global financial crisis of 2006–2009, the agricultural and energy/coal sectors experienced the least decline, and Stifel has noticed a similar pattern. Automotive and industrial products are two economically delicate areas that historically experience the greatest compression during recessions. “While we believe this cycle could be similar to the last recession, there are differences which we believe should work in favor of the rails,” Nolan said. According to Stifel, supply chain congestion is leaving at least 4% of freight demand unmet (current volume vs. 2019 levels), but more likely closer to 8-10%. This means that even if demand declines, volumes should stay high as supply channels unclog. When rail capacity is available, higher fuel prices should encourage freight (especially intermodal) to move from trucking to rail. Only industrial categories (metals, timber, autos, etc.) are at risk due to low domestic oil and gas/coal activity and high global grain prices. Stifel predicts less than a 1% drop in volumes and, in certain cases (CP), volume growth due to typical harvest circumstances, making any recessionary impact on rail volumes much less severe than it was during the previous cycle. Upgrading The East Coast Rails To A Buy “Given current multiples and our view that volume compression is likely to be muted, we expect much better multiple support than in the previous cycle particularly given the structurally improved cash flow generation of the companies,” Nolan wrote, “while all the names are cheaper than they were six months ago, we believe the most upside is likely in the East Coast rails which have seen the greatest negative impact to share price and thus we are upgrading CSX shares with a $37 target price (down from $39) assuming 19x our '23 EPS estimate, and NSC shares with a $275 target price (down from $289) also assuming 19x our '23 EPS estimate.”"

2022-07-28,Norfolk Southern's Return On Capital Employed Insights,"According to Benzinga Pro, during Q2, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) earned $819.00 million, a 16.5% increase from the preceding quarter. Norfolk Southern also posted a total of $3.25 billion in sales, a 11.49% increase since Q1. In Q1, Norfolk Southern earned $703.00 million, and total sales reached $2.92 billion. What Is ROCE? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q2, Norfolk Southern posted an ROCE of 0.06%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Norfolk Southern is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. For Norfolk Southern, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.06% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Analyst Predictions Norfolk Southern reported Q2 earnings per share at $3.45/share, which did not meet analyst predictions of $3.47/share.

2022-09-15,"US Railway Companies, Unions Reach Tentative Agreement Averting Catastrophic Strike","Today morning, the rail companies and union negotiators came to a tentative agreement that balances the needs of workers, businesses, and the economy, after 20 hours of talks. The tentative deal averts a freight railroad strike that had threatened to cripple the U.S. supply chains and push prices higher for many goods. Bloomberg reported that a potential strike by the U.S. rail workers threatens to delay consumer goods sailing from China, affecting global supply chains trying to recover from disruptions due to the pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war. The U.S. imported about $47 billion of goods from China in July. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) has warned that losses would be massive in case of the strike, approximately more than $2 billion per day. American freight-rail companies and unions were in talks to avert a walkout of workers on Friday. Containers have already been stuck at railway yards in the U.S. due to workforce and equipment shortages. Freight rates have dropped steadily from a record last year as consumer demand has waned. Inflation is hitting personal spending, and retailers are running out of warehouse space to store inventory. The White House was reportedly considering emergency measures to keep vital goods and supplies flowing while pushing rail companies and unions to agree ahead of a Friday deadline. The deal gives the union members an immediate 14% raise with back pay dating back to 2020 and raises totaling 24% during the five-year life of the contract, which runs from 2020 through 2024. It also gives them cash bonuses of $1,000 a year. Labor groups have insisted that employees be able to take unpaid time off for physician appointments. There is no mention of sick time, the critical issue for workers in the dispute. The agreement does not mean the strike threat has gone away entirely.

2022-10-27,Norfolk Southern Earnings Perspective: Return On Invested Capital,"According to Benzinga Pro, during Q3, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) earned $958.00 million, a 16.97% increase from the preceding quarter. Norfolk Southern also posted a total of $3.34 billion in sales, a 2.86% increase since Q2. In Q2, Norfolk Southern earned $819.00 million, and total sales reached $3.25 billion. What Is Return On Invested Capital? Return on Invested Capital is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital invested by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROIC. A higher ROIC is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROIC suggests the opposite. In Q3, Norfolk Southern posted an ROIC of 4.73%. Keep in mind, while ROIC is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. ROIC is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROIC shows Norfolk Southern is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of invested capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. For Norfolk Southern, the positive return on invested capital ratio of 4.73% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Upcoming Earnings Estimate Norfolk Southern reported Q3 earnings per share at $3.8/share, which beat analyst predictions of $3.64/share.

We note that persistent network issues are also driving volume underperformance versus expectations. “Our view is that network issues will cause EPS growth to lag peers in the medium-term,” the analyst further mentioned.

2022-11-28,"A Railroad Stoppage Before Christmas Could Cause Over $2 Billion In Economic Damage, Driving Inflation Even Higher","In September, the nation's largest rail unions began negotiating with rail companies to establish better schedules, more pay and paid sick time for its track maintenance workers. Now, four out of the 12 rail unions are yet to ratify the tentative agreements, as SMART - Transportation Division (SMART-TD), one of the largest railroad labor unions, rejected ratification on Nov. 21. What Happened: SMART-TD, Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees (BMWED) and the Brotherhood of Railroad Signalmen (BRS) represent more than 50% of all rail labor. The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers (IBB), BRS and BMWED are set to vote to ratify the tentative agreement on Dec. 4, with a strike deadline that could start on Dec. 9. According to the Association of American Railroads, a nationwide rail shutdown could cost more than $2 billion every day in lost economic output. If the strike does in fact take place, a nearly 140,000-mile network of rails in 49 states and more than 7,000 long-distance Class I trains per day would be idled, which could be devastating to the transportation industry and the U.S. economy during the holiday season. Also Read: Andrew Carnegie Is Born On This Day In Market History Why It Matters: If a railway strike does take place, the U.S. would need an additional 467,000 long-haul trucks per day to move all the railroad freight and roughly 80,000 more truck drivers, according to the report. The American Chemistry Council stated the chemical industry is a $517 billion enterprise that supports more than 25% of U.S. GDP and creates more than half a million American jobs, which would be deeply affected by a railroad shutdown. A letter sent on Sept. 7 from the Fertilizer Institute (TFI) to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader Mitchell McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated, “Over half of all fertilizer moves by rail year-round throughout the United States and the timeliness and reliability of fertilizer shipments is absolutely critical,” adding that, “If farmers do not receive fertilizer, it results in lower crop yields, higher food prices, and more inflation for consumers.” Firms such as United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) and FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) also rely on railroads to ship freight and could also experience slowdowns and price hikes. The Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) CEO Lance Fritz said on CNBC that its BMWED employees were not completely aware of the terms of the agreement in the first vote and he is confident a new agreement can be made. Fritz said this does not mean a strike was not possible, but he does think a strike is less probable. In August, President Joe Biden released the framework for the tentative deal formed in September between major carriers such as Union Pacific and a dozen unions representing 115,000 workers, reported Reuters. On Monday, more than 400 groups called on the U.S. Congress to intervene in the railroad labor strike that could drive inflation higher and cause significant economic damage to the economy. A railroad labor stoppage would also negatively impact Norfolk Southern Corp (NYSE:NSC) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX), which rely on domestic transportation. Photo: Unsplash"
2022-12-01,Biden Asks Senate To 'Act Urgently' As Country-Wide Railroad Strike Could Inflict $2B A Day In Economic Damage,"The possibility of a $2 billion a day cost to the American economy is on the line as President Joe Biden pushes for a government-led negotiation between railroad companies and rail unions. What Happened: On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a piece of legislation that would make rail companies agree to demands posed by the unions in an effort to avoid a country-wide railroad shutdown. According to the Association of American Railroads, a nationwide rail shutdown could cost more than $2 billion every day in lost economic output. The Biden administration was using The Railway Labor Act of 1926, which gave the U.S. government unusually strong powers to regulate collective bargaining for the rail sector. Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NYSE:NSC) are some of the largest railroad companies by market cap. The bill passed the House 290 to 137 with bipartisan support of 211 Democrats and 79 Republicans approving it, reported CNBC. The bill established new contracts for railroad workers which added an extra paid day off, new 24% pay increases from 2020 through 2024 and immediate payouts for an average of $11,000. Paid sick leave — the main bone of contention between railroad workers and rail companies — was covered in a separate bill, which pushed for seven days of paid sick leave a year, instead of only one. It was passed by a closer vote, 221 to 207. Both bills are now headed to the Senate. See Also: Americans Lost Trust In Religion And Congress, But Showed Trust In This Institution Elon Musk Doesn't Like As it stands today (Dec. 1), railroad workers have no guaranteed sick days or the ability to access vacation time in the case of doctor checkups and emergency medical leave. According to New York Magazine, an operational strategy adopted country-wide by the major railroad companies called “precision-scheduled railroading,” was the reason behind the lack of certain rights for railroad workers. The strategy looked to optimize resources by transporting “more freight using fewer workers and railcars.” The strategy led the industry to reduce its workforce by 30% in the past six years, pushing companies to tighten their grips on employee attendance. Four of the largest railroad unions, representing more than 50% of the railroad workforce, have yet to ratify the new agreements with the companies they are employed by and have threatened to strike, freezing a 140,000-mile network of rails in 49 states. Why It Matters: “This overwhelming bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives makes clear that Democrats and Republicans agree that a rail shutdown would be devastating to our economy and families across the country,” said Biden after the passage of the bills. The president urged the Senate to act quickly, as a railroad strike would not only inflict vast damage to the economy but also affect the daily lives of many Americans. The country relies on the railway system for 40% of its annual freight. Key commodities such as fertilizer used in food production and chemicals used to clean drinking water rely on trains for transportation. “Without action this week, disruptions to our auto supply chains, our ability to move food to tables, and our ability to remove hazardous waste from gasoline refineries will begin,” said the president. Railroad unions promised a strike if a deal is not met by Dec. 9. Both bills will be voted on separately by the Senate, meaning that the paid sick leave issue could miss approval if the Republican party were to adopt a filibuster strategy.

2023-01-22,"Tesla, Microsoft, IBM, Intel, TI Among Companies Reporting This Week: Can Netflix's Optimism Spill Over To Rest Of Tech Space?","Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares jumped nearly 8.5% on Friday before settling at their highest level since April 19, 2022, when shares plunged after the company reported its first loss in net paid subscriber adds in a decade. Although the streaming giant delighted Wall Street with strong paid subscriber growth, earnings expectations for S&P 500 companies, in general, have tempered in the past week. How Earnings Season Is Shaping Up: Profit Trends: Earnings of S&P 500 companies are expected to decline 4.6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, down from the 3.9% forecast in the week ended Jan. 13, financial data provider FactSet said in its weekly “Earnings Insight” report. This would mark the first earnings drop since the third quarter of 2020 when profit fell 5.7%. That said, a majority of companies reported upside surprises to both top and bottom-line expectations. About 67% of S&P 500 companies reported better-than-expected earnings per share and 64% announced above-consensus revenue, FactSet said. The average EPS upside is 3.3%, below the 5-year average of 8.6% and the 10-year average of 6.4%. Consumer discretionary, industrial and material sectors reported the largest positive earnings surprises, while the communication services sector chimed in with the largest negative surprises. Netflix, despite its roughly in-line revenue and better-than-expected net paid adds, reported a gross EPS miss. As opposed to expectations of $0.55 per share, the company earned $0.12 per share. Margin Contraction Continues: The blended net profit margin for the S&P 500 companies is 11.4%, lower than the 11.9% reported for the third quarter and 12.4% for the year-ago quarter, FactSet said. This would mark the sixth straight quarter of sequential declines in net profit margin. The margin contraction should not come as a surprise as consumer price inflation, although showing a deceleration, ruled high through the December quarter. The annual rate of core consumer price inflation was at 7.7% in October, 7.1% in November and 6.5% in December, according to data from the Bureau Of Labor Statistics. Outlook Muted: Out of the seven S&P 500 companies issuing EPS guidance for the first quarter, five guided EPS above consensus, while the remaining two announced below-consensus guidance. Looking ahead, 93 S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results in the unfolding week, including 12 Dow Jones companies, FactSet said.

Following the fourth-quarter deliveries report, Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney reduced his 2022 EPS estimate from $3.60 to $3.48, blaming the action on the deliveries miss, and lower ASPs and gross margin assumption.

2023-01-25,Nasdaq Futures Slump As Microsoft's Outlook Dampens Tech Recovery Hopes — Analyst Warns Of More Bumpiness By Mid-February,"U.S. stocks look set to start Wednesday’s session on the back foot as traders digest mixed earnings news flow and continued pouring in of weak economic data points. Cues From Tuesday’s Trading: The major averages closed Tuesday’s session on a mixed note as profit-taking following two straight sessions of strong advances triggered weakness in the market. Lackluster nationwide business activity data provided the impetus to unwind some of the bets. See Also: Best Option Trading Strategies Preliminary estimates released by S&P Global on Tuesday showed that both the manufacturing and services sectors continued to remain in contraction territory. Industrial, real estate, utility and consumer staple stocks saw moderate strength, while communication services, healthcare and IT services stocks move to the downside. The start of trading on Tuesday was marred by a technical glitch on the NYSE that halted trading in many blue-chip stocks. U.S. Indices' Performance On Tuesday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite -0.27% 11,334.27 S&P 500 Index -0.07% 4,016.95 Dow Industrials +0.31% 33,733.96 Analyst Color: “We are in the trough of the S&P 500’s earnings slowdown,” fund manager Louis Navellier said in an exclusive comment to Benzinga. Positive guidance is now more important than actual quarterly results due to the lingering uncertainty, he added. The market held up remarkably well amid lackluster sales and earnings from companies such as 3M Co. (NYSE:MMM), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Union Pacific Corp. (NYSE:UNP) and the technical glitch, he noted. Navellier sees a bumpy mid-February from the earnings perspective and flagged the Federal Open Market Committee meeting’s policy statement due on Feb. 1 as the most important forthcoming event. “The Fed is anticipated to raise the federal funds rate 0.25%, but everyone is hoping for dovish comments in the FOMC statement, like 'data dependent' or 'inflation is moderating' that might imply that the Fed will be done raising key interest rates sooner than later,” he added. Until Feb. 1, bad economic news is good news for the market, Navellier said. Futures Today: U.S. Futures' Performance On Wednesday Index Performance (+/-) Nasdaq 100 Futures -1.18% S&P 500 Futures -0.72% Dow Futures -0.51% R2K Futures -0.55% In premarket trading on Wednesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) slipped 0.67%, to $397.53, and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) slumped 1.13%, to $285.10, according to Benzinga Pro data. Upcoming Economic Data: The Mortgage Bankers Association is due to release the weekly mortgage application volume data at 7 a.m. EST. The metric climbed 27.9 week-over-week in the week ended Jan. 13, with both refinance and purchase activity increasing by double-digit percentages. The Energy Information Administration is scheduled to release its petroleum inventory report for the week ended Jan. 20 at 10:30 a.m. EST. Stocks In Focus: Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares slipped over 2% following the sub-par forecast the company issued on the earnings call. Intuitive Surgical Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) tumbled about 9% after the surgical robot manufacturer reported a fourth-quarter earnings miss. Notable Companies reporting earnings: Before the open: Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE:GD) Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE:NSC) Abbott Labs Inc. (NYSE:ABT) Freeport McMoRan, Inc. (NYSE:FCX) After the close: Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) CSX Corp. (NYSE:CSX) Lam Research Corp. (NYSE:LRCX) Seagate Technology Holding plc (NASDAQ:STX) Top Analysts’ Calls: JPMorgan cuts Tesla price target from $125 to $120 ahead of its quarterly results. Cowen raises price target for Texas Instruments Inc. (NASDAQ:TXN) from $160 to $175. JPMorgan cuts price target for Rivian Automotive Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) from $32 to $28. DA Davidson raises price target for Microsoft from $270 to $280, while JPMorgan and Jefferies reduced their respective price targets. Commodities, Bonds, Other Global Equity Markets: Crude oil futures rose 0.09% to $80.20 on Wednesday, recovering from the previous session’s 1.76% plunge. The benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note held below the 3.5% level and traded down 0.031% points at 3.436%. Asia-Pacific stocks closed Wednesday’s session on a mixed note, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 average extending its gain for the fifth straight session. The South Korean and Singaporean markets, which opened after the Lunar New Year holidays, rose notably, as they played catchup with the gains in the other regional markets. The Chinese, Hong Kong and Taiwanese markets remained closed for trading. India’s Sensex fell over 1.27% after short-seller Hindenburg called out Adani Group, the conglomerate run by the world’s fourth-richest man Gautam Adani, as a con business. European stocks opened Wednesday’s session higher but have reversed course since then.

2023-02-13,Norfolk Train Derailed In Ohio: Company Shares Show Resilience To Liability Claims Over Carcinogenic Chemicals Released Into Environment,"Ten days after a Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) train carrying hazardous materials derailed in Ohio, the more than 1,500 residents forced to evacuate the area continue to wonder if it's safe to come back home. Norfolk stock opened Monday trading with a 2% drop in price after news of the derailment continued to flood news outlets during the weekend. The stock price quickly recovered throughout the morning to reach $241, a hair’s breadth away from Friday's closing price of $242. A notice of potential liability was issued to Norfolk Southern by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Saturday, stated Norfolk may be required to perform cleanup actions to protect the public health, welfare, or the environment, and also be responsible for costs incurred by EPA in cleaning up the site. EPA has spent, or is considering spending, public funds to investigate and control releases of hazardous substances or potential releases of hazardous substances at the site, the letter stated. On Sunday, the EPA released a detailed list of the chemicals carried in the 20 derailed boxcars, via information provided by Norfolk. Many of these chemicals were dispersed into the atmosphere after the derailment caused a massive explosion. Several of the derailed cars were loaded with vinyl chloride, a petroleum-derived compound used in the production of PVC, a normal form of plastic. Vinyl chloride has been proven to produce cancer after long-term or high-volume exposure, according to the National Cancer Institute. Additional fumes were released as five railcar tankers of vinyl chloride were intentionally punctured in order to avoid a second blast. The chemical was diverted into a ditch and then burned. Upon air monitoring operations, the EPA said it has not detected any levels of concern in the community that can be attributed to the incident at this time, in an effort to reassure members of the East Palestine town, who continue to report unsettling odors although they've been allowed to return home since Wednesday, according to the Washington Post. The EPA's official report recognized that odors might still be smelled around the town. At least four lawsuits from East Palestine residents have been issued to Norfolk Southern. The company has independently established a family assistance center and is reimbursing residents who were forced to leave their homes. Following over 400 requests to analyze indoor toxicity, the EPA stated that as of Saturday evening, 210 screened homes showed no detection of vinyl chloride or hydrogen chloride; 218 remain unchecked."
2023-02-15,"Norfolk Southern Under Lens After Ohio Train Derailment; Air, Water & Soil Tests Look For Chemicals","Norfolk Southern Corp (NYSE:NSC) is reportedly under scrutiny as cleanup and environmental-monitoring efforts continue in an Ohio town after the derailment of a train carrying hazardous chemicals. Around 50 cars of a 150-car Norfolk Southern train derailed earlier this month in East Palestine, causing a chemical fire and prompting the evacuation of residents. Officials had to drain vinyl chloride from five tanker cars to prevent an explosion. Some derailed, breached, or burned railcars carried other chemicals that can present health hazards, such as isobutylene, a flammable gas, and butyl acrylate, used to make coatings and sealants, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Though the accident remains under investigation, federal transportation safety officials note a train car wheel bearing overheated and failed before the derailment. State environmental and health officials said the controlled release of chemicals affected local waterways, causing the death of about 3,500 fish. Several lawsuits have been filed against Norfolk Southern, alleging negligence and exposure to toxic substances. Norfolk said it had distributed more than $1.2 million directly to families to cover evacuation costs and has helped more than 700 families and some businesses, Wall Street Journal reported. Price Action: NSC shares are up 1.88% at $239.71 premarket on the last check Wednesday."

2023-03-15,Norfolk Southern Should Be Held Financially Responsible For Fatal Rail Accidents: Ohio Attorney General Sues,"Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost filed a complaint against Norfolk Southern Corp (NYSE:NSC) seeking civil penalties, damages, court costs, and other relief related to the rail derailment on February 3. The company is under scrutiny as cleanup and environmental-monitoring efforts continue in an Ohio town after the derailment of a train carrying hazardous chemicals. The lawsuit asked the court to order the company to pay for damages to natural resources, property, and economic harm done to the state and its residents. The attorney general's office cited Norfolk Southern for 58 alleged violations of state and federal laws. The derailment in East Palestine, Ohio was both foreseeable and preventable, the lawsuit said. Norfolk Southern's record demonstrates that it knew—and should have taken appropriate steps to prevent—the significant harm the derailment would cause the state. Norfolk Southern Chief Executive Alan Shaw apologized for the derailment, which spilled toxic chemicals near the Pennsylvania border, Wall Street Journal reported. It has recovered and transported more than 3.5 million gallons of potentially affected water from the site and more than 2,300 tons of affected soil, Mr. Shaw said last week. The National Transportation Safety Board has launched a special investigation of Norfolk Southern's organization and safety culture concerning recent derailments and fatal railroad operations accidents.

2023-03-16,Ominous Death Cross Forms On Norfolk Southern's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Norfolk Southern, which is trading around $205.22 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at Norfolk Southern's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q4 2022 Q3 2022 Q2 2022 Q1 2022 EPS Estimate 3.44 3.64 3.47 2.92 EPS Actual 3.42 3.80 3.45 2.93 Revenue Estimate 3.20B 3.23B 3.13B 2.84B Revenue Actual 3.24B 3.34B 3.25B 2.92B Also consider this overview of Norfolk Southern analyst ratings: Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2023-03-21,How Is The Market Feeling About Norfolk Southern?,"Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) short percent of float has risen 22.92% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.68 million shares sold short, which is 1.18% of all regular shares that are available for trading.

2023-04-04,"US Stocks Stumble, Treasuries And Gold Rally On Rising Recession Fears – Traders Anticipate Fed Pause In May","Markets swung on Tuesday after further data indications signaled an impending slowdown in economic activity. Job postings decreased more than expected in February, showing the first signs of labor market softening, while declining factory orders reinforced the lackluster ISM Manufacturing PMI print on Monday. Recent economic data have prompted investors to discount increasing odds of a recession, thus further trimming Fed hike expectations, liquidating stocks, and flocking to safe-haven assets such as treasuries and gold. Cues From Tuesday's Trading: U.S. equity indices fell into the red after the weaker-than-expected job openings data. Small-cap and cyclical sectors sold off, while large-cap and defensive names fared relatively better. The S&P 500 index fell below 4,100 points, down 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index lost 200 points, or 0.5%, to 33,400. The Russell 2000 index was the underperformer, down 2% on the day. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite eased 0.4%. U.S. Indices' Performance On Tuesday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq Composite -0.4% 12,141.74 S&P 500 Index -0.6% 4,096.45 Dow Industrials -0.5% 33,409.34 Analyst Color: Given the mixed economic data, Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, sees the next Fed rate decision in May being a “near-tossup.” “We have a hold lightly penciled into our forecast but another quarter-point hike wouldn’t be a surprise,” he added. Tuesday's Trading In Major U.S. Equity ETFs: In midday trading Tuesday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) lost 0.6% to $408.72, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was 0.7% lower to $333.68 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) edged 0.2% down to $319.56, according to Benzinga Pro data.

The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLI) was also in deep red, down 2.4%. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU) was the best performer of the day, up by 0.6%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLV) also rose 0.4%. Latest Economic Data: The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the number of job openings fell by 632,000 to 9.9 million in February 2023, the lowest level since May 2021 and below market estimates of 10.4 million, suggesting that the labor market may have begun to weaken. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, new orders for U.S. manufactured goods decreased 0.7% month-on-month in February 2023, following a revised 2.1% loss in January and falling short of market estimates of a 0.5% contraction. The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index increased for the third month in a row to 47.4 in April 2023, the highest level since December 2021, up from 46.9 in March.

2023-04-27,Looking Into Norfolk Southern's Return On Capital Employed,"Pulled from Benzinga Pro data, Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) posted Q1 earnings of $466.00 million, an increase from Q4 of 41.01%. Sales dropped to $3.10 billion, a 4.23% decrease between quarters. In Q4, Norfolk Southern earned $790.00 million, and total sales reached $3.24 billion. What Is Return On Capital Employed? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q1, Norfolk Southern posted an ROCE of 0.04%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows Norfolk Southern is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth. For Norfolk Southern, the positive return on capital employed ratio of 0.04% suggests that management is allocating their capital effectively. Effective capital allocation is a positive indicator that a company will achieve more durable success and favorable long-term returns. Upcoming Earnings Estimate Norfolk Southern reported Q1 earnings per share at $3.32/share, which beat analyst predictions of $3.12/share.

2023-05-17,Chugging Through Challenges: NSC And ODFL Earn Upgrades Amid Freight Frenzy,"Evercore ISI analyst Jonathan Chappell upgraded the ratings of Norfolk Southern Corp (NYSE:NSC) and Old Dominion Freight Line Inc (NASDAQ:ODFL) from In Line to Outperform. Industry-specific freight demand amid ongoing retail destocking, shaky consumer confidence, and a mix of still-elevated inflation and an uplift in jobless claims has been unpacked for much of the last three months, said the analyst. The analyst believes a material uplift in fundamental volume or pricing factors could outweigh the legacy macro correlations, but a catalyst for the drivers seems unlikely in the coming quarter. The analyst said transport stocks may be rangebound, at best, through the summer. Barring a quick and unexpected reversal in underlying volume or pricing fundamentals, the analyst expects unfavorable macro factors to weigh on share prices across the group through the summer. The analyst commented that the absence of any volume or pricing recovery would then still warrant material downward estimate revisions, and potential multiple contraction as well. NSC has underperformed other U.S. rails and every other transport stock under coverage year to date for many obvious reasons associated with the derailment of hazardous train cars in East Palestine, Ohio, in early February, said the analyst. The headlines and political scrutiny have been intense, and the impact on volumes and costs has been material, weighing on 1Q23 revenue and margins, likely to continue into early 3Q23. When operations resume and many one-time costs are in the rearview mirror, there is a large top - and bottom -line reversion opportunity for NSC, added the analyst. The analyst stated that ODFL’s national blue-chip LTL network is not immune to macro headwinds, as seen in the 1Q23 earnings and April-to-date volume figures. In the macro backdrop required for the others to post volume and margin expansion, ODFL will also return to material top - and bottom-line growth, said the analyst. Choppy markets alone could result in a flight to quality, and the reversion opportunity for ODFL is robust through yearend, but when investors begin to consider an eventual freight and economic recovery, old faithful will provide significant operating leverage again, the analyst concluded."

2023-09-18,Looking Into Norfolk Southern's Recent Short Interest,"Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) short percent of float has risen 3.57% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 2.63 million shares sold short, which is 1.16% of all regular shares that are available for trading.

Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

2023-10-02,Norfolk Southern Stock Downgraded: BofA Flags Increasing Concerns Over Data Integrity and Operational Setbacks,"BofA Securities analyst Ken Hoexter downgraded the shares of Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) from Buy to Neutral and lowered the price target from $266 to $215. NSC’s multiple external impacts to its operations are of increasing concern over its data integrity, along with suspension in customer moves, which can lead to potential share loss to peers, said the analyst. The analyst lowered FY 23/’24/’25 EPS estimate 6%/7%/6%, to $11.90/$13.00 /$14.50, from $12.60/$14.00/$15.45. The analyst noted that the company experienced a data center outage Friday (Sept 29) evening, which suspended its dispatching, train starts, and terminal operating systems until Sept 30 morning, which is expected to impact operations over the next two weeks. This follows a similar outage on Aug 28 when a failure in its IT infrastructure led to a 12-hour outage, stopping it from launching new trains or in-gating arriving trains, added the analyst. The analyst believes this is an increasing risk to future earnings as a lack of service consistency could lead to share loss and challenged pricing gains. Although service improved in July after Norfolk’s February East Palestine derailment, its performance stalled, with velocity down 4% since early July. The analyst expects the slowing service gains and higher added headcount to result in suspended cost mitigation, given its inability to generate capacity through asset turns. Also, the analyst expects negative leverage as well as increased fuel costs to lead to lower margins. Price Action: NSC shares are trading lower by 3.51% at $190.02 on the last check Monday."
