Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) is a buy, Cramer said, if it pulls back to $46-$47. In the last three months the stock has gained over 23%. Yesterday it closed at $53.90. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) is a Buy by Cramer. So far, during the current year Shares of Coca-Cola Company have surged over 16%. The stock closed at $52.34, very near to its 52-week high of $55.00. PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP) is also a stock to buy. . In the last three months the stock has gained over 10%. Yesterday it closed at $58.54."
2009-12-09,Goldman Sachs Launches Coverage of MLM And VMC,"Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) initiated coverage of construction materials firms Martin Marietta (NYSE: MLM) and Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC). The bank rates the former a buy, and the latter a neutral. The bank is generally bullish on the industry, believing that “consensus drastically underestimates the impact of accelerating residential construction on aggregates demand.” As a result, Goldman’s 2011 estimates for the sector are around 20% above consensus. The bank favors Martin Marietta over Vulcan due to a more attractive valuation and better balance sheet capacity for mergers and acquisitions. MLM was up $2.56 in trading today to close at $85.06; VMC traded down 35 cents to $47.69."

2010-01-15,"Demand For Construction Materials Down, But Prices Stable (MLM, VMC)","The demand for construction materials was down 27% y/y. However aggregate prices have demonstrated signs of greater stability over prior months, although concerns remain about discounting on large highway projects that will lead to flat-to-down pricing in 1H10 and ~1% pricing for 2010. Analyst Garik Shmois from LONGBOW Research has revised his estimates for Martin Marietta Materials, Inc (NYSE: MLM) and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) to incorporate weaker volume in 4Q09E from wet weather and weaker than anticipated near-term demand, particularly in Texas. For Martin Marietta Materials, Inc, the analyst forecasts 4Q09E EPS of $0.33 (-$0.09), FY09E EPS of $2.30 (-$0.09) and FY10E EPS of $2.80 (-$0.75). The current FY09E EPS is at the low-to-mid end of management’s $2.20-2.45 guidance range. For Vulcan Materials Company, 4Q09E EPS has been reduced to ($0.05) vs. +$0.08 prior."
2010-01-29,Vulcan Materials to Revisit Lows?,"Producer of crushed stone, sand, and gravel for construction, Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC), is seeing a very bearish trade this morning with the May $40 puts bought for $1.85. The trade occurred very near the asking price and is significantly above open interest, indicating new, bearish positioning. Vulcan Materials has been selling off since April 2007 with little rallies along the way. The technicals look very bearish for the stock; if it were to break down from the $45 level, then the stock would bee-line for $40, where it would find support. $35-40 is the range of the March low and it appears that this trader is betting that the company revisits that valuation."
2010-02-06,Vulcan Materials Company (VMC) Still Struggling,"Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) will do well to break even when it reports last quarter's earnings after the market closes on Monday, February 8th. Analysts expect an EPS of $0.00 - a breakeven - versus the $0.14 per share earned in the same quarter a year earlier. Revenue is expected to have fallen from $799.2 million to $651.9 million for the quarter. The building materials company, if analysts are right, will have earned $0.27 per share for the year, on revenue of $2.73 billion. For 2010, analysts expect Vulcan Materials Company to earn $0.83 per share, and generate revenue of $2.92 billion. Vulcan topped earnings estimates by a penny last quarter, but fell short in the three before that one."

While expressing his opinion on FLIR Systems (NASDAQ: FLIR), Jim said that the dip in the value of the company’s shares has offered a buying opportunity. Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC) has not as yet disclosed whether it has received federal stimulus money and, hence, Jim advices investors to refrain from buying this company’s shares.

2010-03-15,Bookkeeping: 2 New Shorts,"I have a bunch of limit short orders outstanding now, but most stocks targeted will need to jump 4-7% for me to hit. I found a handful of candidates but most of the names I really would like to short are down quite strongly today - that doesn't mean they cannot continue to tail spin but if this market reverses and heads over S&P 1150, I don't want to take the chance. Instead I went for some secondary choices to replace the short exposure I let go today, simply to keep my allocations consistent. First, Cemex (CX) - one of the world's largest cement producers; which was on the brink of default if memory serves me, a year or so ago. I have shorted a 3% allocation at $10.20. Any move over last week's highs, i.e. $10.60ish will have me out of the stock. Dream scenario is a move down to $9.25 but I'd probably be content with $9.50 - which would be a 7% gain. Technically the stock has run into the 50 day moving average and hopefully it stalls there. Second, Vulcan Materials (VMC) - which is almost the same sector as Cemex... construction aggregrates. I don't expect huge profits on this one, 4-5% would be fine and it's mostly a market hedge for downside... but the entry point is so low risk I had to take it. I am shorting with a 3% allocation around $45.30 and have a clear exit point just over $46.00 which is less than a 2% loss if it triggers. I also considered Shanda Interactive (SNDA) - a Chinese video game operator. One could make a play here at shorting at the 20 day moving average... trying to be greedy I instead placed my stop order near to the 50 day moving average. Not sure if it will have the juice to reach it, but if so it will provide more of a margin of safety. In the real world, I'd probably place a short here (20 day moving average) with a very tiny stop loss (within 1%) - but I don't want to bother writing the transactions out on the website (I'm short! but 20 minutes later I'm stopped out!), so I'm skipping it at this level, but it's one of my outstanding short limit orders and worthwhile for the nimble... First Solar (FSLR) was another option - but a very volatile stock in which a news announcement can move it 10% overnight. Love the pattern though. Short Cemex, Vulcan Materials in fund; no personal position"
2010-03-16,Bookkeeping: Stopped Out of Vulcan Materials (VMC) Short,"Not surprisingly the never ending melt up is taking away some short exposure... as noted yesterday the advantage in shorting Vulcan Materials (VMC) was it was just below a very close by stop out point, in this case $46.00. I gave it an extra 10 cents to provide me some leeway, and that kept us in for most of the morning, but the breakout in the S&P 500 has launched this stock, among many others I am sure. Student body left trading. The entry yesterday was $45.30, stop loss $46.10. Hence we lost 1.75% on 3% of the portfolio - no big deal. The only question is how much longer the other 2 shorts entered yesterday will stay alive. I doubt much longer. One of these days we are going to get the mother of all head fakes as everyone seems to be doing the exact same trade on the indexes, and they just are far too textbook. But I've been saying that for about 9 months in a row, incorrectly. As I thought about the state of affairs last night, I think this market is discounting a census filled, make up for February snowstorm jobs number that is coming in a few weeks (early April). It could be +250,000 jobs (+100-125K census, +75K to make up for February snowstorms) and since no one in the markets other than economists read anything other than the headline number, the euphoria should be extreme. This could be part of the explanation for the non stop move here the past month. It will also make for a very interesting fall 2010 when the census jobs go away. No position x"
2010-03-17,"You Can Still Make Money on the Short Side, but It's Tough","When I added Cemex (CX) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) as shorts Monday, to create some downside hedges - I offered my third choice would have been Shanda Interactive (SNDA) ... indeed if I was not writing down all my material moves on the website, I offered in the real world I would have done this transaction. In the real world, I'd probably place a short here (20 day moving average) with a very tiny stop loss (within 1%) - but I don't want to bother writing the transactions out on the website (I'm short! but 20 minutes later I'm stopped out!), so I'm skipping it at this level, but it's one of my outstanding short limit orders and worthwhile for the nimble... In retrospect that one actually would of worked, to the tune of 7%! Which in this type of market is akin to 25% considering how strong the market is. That gain actually would of offset the 2 losses in CX and VMC nicely and kept us flat among the 3 short positions - which is a victory in this sort of circumstance. So a bit of misfortune as I did not take the trade that did work, and instead went with two that the market melt up helped carry up. But it sure isn't easy to have anything on the short side of the ledger. As Jim Cramer says .. there is always a bear market somewhere. Err... No position x"
2010-03-17,"Fast Money Lightening Round: Jim Trounces VIP, VMC, AVP; Favors CL, PL Instead","In his “Mad Money Lightening Round,” Jim Cramer warned investors to not buy Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC). VMC gained 2.22% yesterday. Jim also thinks that it is time to get out of VimpelCom (NYSE: VIP). VIP added 1.36% in yesterday’s trading. According to Jim, Avon Products (NYSE: AVP) does not have good growth prospects and it is better to invest in Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) instead. While AVP rose 1.25%, CL added 0.30% and PG lost 0.27% in yesterday’s trading. When asked about ArcSight (NASDAQ: ARST), Jim said that investors should hold the stock only till the mid-$30s. ARST fell 1.42% yesterday. Cramer expressed his disappointment with Transocean’s (NYSE: RIG) results for the latest quarter. However, he admitted that RIG was the only big company in the sector. RIG added 1.96%. Read more on Jim Cramer."
2010-03-22,"Bookkeeping: Weekly Changes to Fund Positions Year 3, Week 33","Year 3, Week 33 Major Position Changes To see historic weekly fund changes click here OR the label at the bottom of this entry entitled 'fund positions'. Cash: 71.6% (v 73.1% last week) 18 long bias: 19.3% (v 22.1% last week) 5 short bias: 9.1% (v 7.4% last week) [Includes 1 'long dollar' position] 23 positions (vs 22 last week) Weekly thoughts Last week? Almost a repeat of the previous week. A slow grind up, relentless in nature. Any minor intraday dips bought greedily. Complacency overwashing all. I was wrong yet again in calling for at least a minor (2-3%!) selloff at some point during the week; that makes it 2 weeks in a row made the fool. As I said last week, I'll keep repeating it will happen -- until it happens. Sooner or later I have to be correct. Amazingly Friday was the first down day over 0.2%ish in the ENTIRE month of March. And only the second since mid February. Effectively that is 2 down days in 6 weeks; and both those were minor affairs. Strangely a lot of the stocks I own have been doing nothing for 2+ weeks, as the market grinds higher using the strength of other sectors we don't have much exposure too. Like scouts in 1400 AD I've sent forth some candidates on the short side, only to be slaughtered for the most part. But with very tight stop losses, I've kept the damage at a minimum... ironically when this correction comes I expect some of the most damage to be in the names that have run the most, because there is such glee and carefree attitude around them, but anyone early has been sent out on a stretcher trying to bet against these names. So with that let me bring out my broken record and say we are overdue for a pullback. Even the bushiest of bulls, Jim Cramer has been plaintively calling for one the last 3 sessions. Let's take a look at the S&P 500 chart: [click to enlarge] After breaking over January 2010 highs, and clearing S&P 1153 this index immediately raced to 1170. Then one day of stalling, and a slight pullback Friday. I though the move down Friday would be stronger because (see broken record above), but instead - after falling through 1160 a swoon in the last hours was met by those dip buyers in the closing 30 minutes. So we sit half way between 2 key points - recent support (breakout point) at 1150, and recent highs of 1170. These are areas I call white noise ranges, and those 20 S&P points mean nothing to me... like any good supercomputer I will be a buyer over new highs and make an *attempt* again at shorting more aggressively is 1150 can be broken with conviction. In between those 2 lines, the market tells me nothing. We see an identical pattern in the NASDAQ; just replace 1150 with 2325, and 1170 with 2400. The Russell 2000 is on a warpath of it's own, and the strongest of the major indexes. Rather than looking at that chart which is not that interesting let's continue to look at the 3 sectors leading this charge off the February lows - we see very little weakness in any but again... they are massively overextended. But that is all bad you can really say about them. If S&P 500 level 1150 is broken, my forecast might actually come to fruition [What's the Potential End Game for this Move] and I'd look to be targeting S&P 1124. But anticipating such things has been like a solo salmon swimming against a massive tide in the stream. ------------------------------------------------------------ Economic news remains fixed and this market seems to be anticipating what I forecast to be a quite positive jobs figure (which will combine census jobs, February jobs lost to snowstorm and the 100K jobs the birth death model seems to plug in almost every month). Quite rarely, this report will be released on a market holiday (Good Friday) which will leave the market a full 3 days to digest it; that is going to make for a very interesting situation for traders and the 'fast money' types who now dominate trading. If the report was this Friday I'd say the market was creating a classic sell the news reaction since it has run up so much in anticipation to the news, but in 2 weeks anything can happen so we'll have to reassess how things look a week from Wednesday or so. Quarter end mark up games also await us in that time frame. Economic data has been shrugged off most of the past few weeks so not sure how much it matters as long as every central bank and government pledges to bailout / backstop every other entity on Earth, but on the docket: Tuesday: Existing Home Sales Wednesday: (the always volatile) Durable Goods, New Home Sales Thursday: Jobless Claims - weekly Friday: the 3rd! revision to Q4 09 GDP (yawn), and Consumer Sentiment As for home sales, existing homes are always far more important than new home sales as they make up about 90% of transactions in America. As happens EVERY spring, we shall see each month get progressively better as home transactions are a seasonal event. Last year, this fact was ignored as the great house recovery was announced as March was better than January, May was better than March, and July was better than May. I will be curious if the market will be shocked by the same thing happening this year. I do believe a lot of first time home buyers were drawn in to the government handout last year, and short of new and bigger incentives by government we'll only see the normal seasonal growth. Thus far the homebuilders have not surged more than the market as a whole, and much of their great earnings results have been less from operations and much more to do with the grandest of taxpayer giveaways - effectively 75% of the taxes we collected from these firms from the bubble times is being handed right back as Congress is a very generous bunch. The other wildcard are potential rate increases especially in Asia. Brazil surprisingly decided to hold rates steady this week, while India did a rate increase. China is the other, and while America's market is celebrating, China's continues to stall. ------------------------------------------------------------ For the fund, net positions (long v short v cash) did not change must although the names did. On the long side, after throwing so many sacrificial lambs out to be eaten, I am now trying to do it with a few long names (most prominently ANR) to try to bring this market down. I sent ANR up the volcano, and perhaps my knuckling in to chase after a market darling will be the straw that breaks the camel's back. ;) 3 different of our stocks were actually downgraded on valuation this week - as if anyone care's about such things, right Baidu? Early in the week a limit purchase order hit for TriQuint Semiconductor (TQNT) after it pulled back to the 50 day moving average; that position was sold right back out after a 8% gain within days as TQNT raised guidance. The stock immediately fell after I sold, so I got the position back - this company gets no respect despite a steady stream of good news, so I have to trade it. The big move of the week was an index play where after thinking I might get 16 points on the downside Monday (if S&P 1140 was to break), instead I grabbed 16 points on the upside with a move from 1154 to 1170ish. Half my index positions (SPY calls, and TNA ETF) were sold just under 1170, and another half sold once 1165 was broken. Late in the week I restarted coal player Alpha Natural Resources (ANR) [sacrifice to the gods so that they would bring us a real selloff] with a 1% position, and healthcare e-records name Quality Systems (QSII) as a potential breakout candidate - which it was doing Friday, but the down market slowed it. Friday, I closed lagging Seagate Technologies (STX). On the short side, I attempted to short True Religion (TRLG) - still holding this one. I had less than 24 hours in shorts of Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Cemex (CX) - they stopped out very quickly. My other candidate of the week - Shanda Interactive (SNDA) actually turned out to be an excellent short, but I did not take it. For the sport of it, I shorted the stock which went 1 full month without 1 down session - Maidenform Brands (MFB). As mentioned above I thought a break of S&P 1160 Friday would lead to more damage so attempted some downside index plays (SPY puts, short TNA) but only squeezed out a few measly points as the market smashed shorts who attempted this breakdown play with a quick rally to finish off the week. One has had to be so agile to make even a few sheckles on the short side the past 6 weeks. To finish of this week's summary let me show you some stocks of concern - and potential things I will be punting. First, Google (GOOG) which was breaking out nicely until news broke they will be pulling out of China... I bought this as a technical breakout, and now it appears ready to fail. I cut a little of the position late in the week, but if it breaks down the rest will go. Brazilian chemical maker Braskem (BAK) was also looking like a breakout - but then it stalled. Frustrating, when if it was Braskem the women's apparel company it would be running day after day. I'm a little frustrated with these names, and in fact my entire long portfolio the past few weeks since other than Las Vegas Sands (LVS) nothing has really broken out to the upside and made a strong run. So to join the playbook I need to start to deploy to retail, industrials, and financials. So I can go chase a name like Harley Davidson (HOG) which has shown almost no uptick in business but due to vague market rumors of a buyout bid by private equity ... is flying. Plus its consumer discretionary - so HAL9000 is buying it hand over fist. Riverbed Technology (RVBD) reports this week, so hopefully something that disappoints the Street, even if it's not really bad - to get some air out of the stock. The stock has been weak of late, after a downgrade on valuation - and while still at support, looks like it could face more downside. The last 2 positions are TriQuint and Alpha Natural Resources - which at this point I plan to buy even if they break support, and build up positions. The former can't win despite constant good news, and the latter could start posting some -6 to -8% days if the market EVER pulls back. I will be looking to add other coal and iron ore names even if they fall through some support levels because once the market turns back up, these are the go to names (seemingly replacing Freeport McMoran) for this recent leg of the all good news is good news market. So I'll take some losses in the near term to build up the position, not knowing where they bottom."
2010-03-25,"Cramer Gives His Advice On CX,  VMC, CHU, CTL, WIN, TEVA, THC, AIG, S, Q, AINV, FSLR, EQT  ","Jim Cramer said on CNBC's Mad Money Lightning Round that he doesn't like Cemex SAB de CV (ADR) (NYSE: CX). He would rather buy Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) which is making a comeback. Cemex (CX) dropped 3.92% today, and Vulcan Materials (VMC) closed 2.96% down. China Unicom (Hong Kong) Limited (ADR) (NYSE: CHU) is too low to sell, but Cramer is extremely disappointed with this company. He owns this stock for his charitable trust, but believes that Chinese stock market should be avoided. China Unicom (CHU) dropped 5.02% today. CenturyTel, Inc. (NYSE: CTL) has a good yield, good growth and Cramer thinks it is a buy. CTL dropped 0.62% today. Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (ADR) (NASDAQ: TEVA) is a best generic company in the world and Cramer is a buyer. TEVA added 0.16% today. Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE: THC) is in good situation and Cramer sees it at $7. Tenet Healthcare (THC) fell 2.51% today. Cramer doesn't like American International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) and thinks it is a sell. AIG gained 4.04% on Thursday. Sprint Nextel Corporation (NYSE: S) needs a takeover, thinks Cramer, and he can't recommend a stock that has bad fundamentals just on the takeover basis. If you want to speculate with a low price stock you should go with Qwest Communications International Inc. (NYSE: Q). Sprint (S) fell 4.31% today and Qwest (Q) lost 0.95%. Apollo Investment Corp. (NASDAQ: AINV) pays a good dividend, but Cramer thinks you should not buy it. AINV fell 1.36% today. Jim Cramer took an advice from WSJ journalist and didn't buy First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR). He thinks you shouldn't buy it either. First Solar (FSLR) added 2.38% today. Mad Money host recommended EQT Corporation (NYSE: EQT) at $44, but natural gas dropped and so did natural gas companies. He didn't see it coming, but he still likes EQT as a long term play and thinks it is a buy. EQT fell 1.69% today."

(Data is through last Friday's closing prices) (click to enlarge) Period 3 was simple to describe - up or sideways.... but mostly up. A remarkable period with no pullbacks of any sort; as the period ended the S&P 500 had gone 7 weeks without a 1% correction. The Russell 2000 at one point had been up 15 of 17 sessions, with shorter but similar streaks in NYSE and S&P 500. The negative days were almost all of the -0.2% variety. All news was good news as Greece was finally backstopped by the EU/IMF and investors looked ahead to a census laden jobs report at the beginning of April. Housing data was weak but ignored. Consumer discretionary, financials, and industrials dominated as did niche sectors like insurance, restaurants, airliner production, and autos. Major emerging markets did not do as well with China and Brazil in particular struggling. I was unable to pull another +8.7% period which would of been nice, as I was trying to put together 13 in a row - Bernie style. For the third four week period of 2010 the fund returned +8.3%, versus the market's +5.7%, so an outperformance of +2.6%.On a cumulative basis the return is +27.9%, versus the Russell 1000's+4.9%, so an outperformance of +23.0% for the year to date. (thus far 12 weeks) Period 3 achieved both absolute performance (making money) and relative performance (outperforming the market). The yearly goal of beating the index by 15% has been achieved. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *** Long/Short Fund Discussion below Overview: The chart for period 3 says it all - rally, followed by rally, followed by rally. Much of it came (yet again) in premarket as many days were full of almost no movement between 10 AM and 3:30 PM as the computers churned the market. It feels very emotionless and aside from a few breakouts in the indexes there were not many trading opportunities since so much of the movement came overnight. The only weakness of any sort came in the last week and even that was minor. This is the hardest type of market to keep up with with our sort of strategy, versus the easiest for the typical mutual fund crowd. Week 1: The market was just finishing 2 weeks of a bounce off the 200 day moving average and was running into resistance (a funny word in retrospect) around the 50 day on the S&P 500 the previous week. After breaking over that level this week, there was no turning back for the entire period. Of course we did not know that in advance so we were heavily hedged at 12% long, 7% short, and the remainder in cash (much of the short was simply long US dollars). We sold the last of our month long (held) dollar calls early in the week for a sizeable gain which helped us keep pace with the frantic market. I was looking for a stock that was near support but had not joined the party early in the week so I expanded our position in Rackspace Hosting (RAX)... unfortunately the stock did nothing all week despite a market going ballistic. Assured Guaranty (AGO) was sold completely out as it was not participating in the rally; it also did nothing the rest of the week. Added some Ultra Silver (AGQ) as the precious metals charts started to shape up... this one did pan out (would of been funnier if I had bought gold). I cut back DragonWave (DRWI) mid week as the stock not only was a non participant in the festitivies but broke support; in retrospect that worked out in the near term. F5 Networks (FFIV) has gone up 20% in a short amount of time, so I took 70% off the table. Then I did the unthinkable - I shorted some stocks... using Greenhill & Co (GHL), American Superconductor (AMSC) and AthenaHealth (ATHN). Week 2: With the market bouncing smartly off the 50 day moving average I went much more heavy to the long side - including some index positions. Cash was drawn down to 66%, longs up to 22% and shorts up to 12%. The largest positions Profits were taken in Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both early in the week, and later as the stock shot up. (consumer discretionary) This was the best stock of the period by a mile. I restarted positions in Google (GOOG), Braskem (BAK) & Riverbed Technology (RVBD) DragonWave (DRWI) was also closed out, (but surely must be due for a dead cat bounce) and Seagate Technology (STX) after breaking support (50 day moving average), was cut back by 40%. My largest short at the time Greenhill & Co (GHL) was stopped out. Week 3: At this point with yet another V shaped bounce, I began thinking the market was overdue for at least a moderate pullback (2%? 4%?) Not so much. I did not add to any shorts however as the strength of the market was too powerful - long exposure was 19%, short 8% (as always some of this being long US dollar), and cash 73%. This was not much different from the previous week but I did a lot of adjusting to new names. The largest % gain for the fund happened this week when we caught a 16 point S&P move with SPY calls and levered index ETFs On the long side we had a trade in TQNT: Early in the week a limit purchase order hit for TriQuint Semiconductor (TQNT) after it pulled back to the 50 day moving average; that position was sold right back out after a 8% gain within days as TQNT raised guidance. The stock immediately fell after I sold, so I got the position back - this company gets no respect despite a steady stream of good news, so I have to trade it. The big move of the week was an index play where after thinking I might get 16 points on the downside Monday (if S&P 1140 was to break), instead I grabbed 16 points on the upside with a move from 1154 to 1170ish. Half my index positions (SPY calls, and TNA ETF) were sold just under 1170, and another half sold once 1165 was broken. Late in the week I restarted coal player Alpha Natural Resources (ANR) [sacrifice to the gods so that they would bring us a real selloff] with a 1% position, and healthcare e-records name Quality Systems (QSII) as a potential breakout candidate - which it was doing Friday, but the down market slowed it. Friday, I closed lagging Seagate Technologies (STX). On the short side: I attempted to short True Religion (TRLG). I had less than 24 hours in shorts of Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Cemex (CX) - they stopped out very quickly. For the sport of it, I shorted the stock which went 1 full month without 1 down session - Maidenform Brands (MFB). I thought a break of S&P 1160 Friday would lead to more damage so attempted some downside index plays (SPY puts, short TNA) but only squeezed out a few measly points as the market smashed shorts who attempted this breakdown play with a quick rally to finish off the week. Week 4: The relentless move up, as the S&P was over 1150 and not looking back. Entered the week 19% long, 9% short and 72% cash. It was difficult to apply cash at this point to the long side because most of the names I like were up tremendously since the Feb lows with almost no pullback. Index plays this week were losers as most of the market move was in premarket and some choppy action had us constantly stopping out. On the long side I began a position in NetLogic Microsystems (NETL) simply due to error - the stock split 2:1 and the simulator I run my portfolio in did not compensate so my long standing limit buy order executed - it was a small order so no big deal. Within 48 hours after splitting the company did an offering, at which point I bought more shares, to make the position a moderate size. I started a position in Massey Energy (MEE) - within hours the company announced a stock offering (notice a theme?), which hurt the stock - but in the George Costanza market, stocks now rally when they company diluted shareholders. I closed a large position in Google (GOOG) for a smallish loss as it broke support and continued to sell off on the same news from China.... which appears to have set the bottom in the stock. EnerNOC (ENOC) a position held since last fall was closed out, as it has been unable to move for many weeks on end. On the short side - I reshorted Athenahealth (ATHN) which has been good to us; we won again as I quickly covered for a 3% gain. That might sound like peanuts but 3% down in this market is like 15% down in a normal market. AsiaInfo Holdings (ASIA) was shorted as it broke support and eyed a large gap in its chart. I covered a multi week short in True Religion (TRLG) for only a 1% loss and consider it a major victory as the stock went nowhere for 2-3 weeks as its sector was the hottest in the market. Exact same logic in Maidenform Brands (MFB) - the strength of the market simply hit my stop loss and I could not stay in. I covered our modest allocation in iShares Barclays 20+ Year Bond (TLT) as bonds swooned mid week.

2010-04-05,Stephens Inc. Reiterates Equal Weight Rating On Vulcan Materials (VMC),"In a research report released today, Stephens Inc. reiterated their Equal Weight rating and $45.00 price target on shares of Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC). The analysts wrote that we expect that highway funding uncertainty coupled with wet weather across much of the Southeast, particularly in January, kept what little construction activity there was in the quarter at bay. With that said, due to the recent signing of the Jobs Bill, or HIRE Act as it has become known, we expect that highway funding should begin to flow again with increased funding visibility since the legislature insured that federal highway funding will continue until December 2010. The firm believes, however, that this is already baked into 2010 guidance and Street expectations. The firm's $45.00 price target is based on 13X 2011 estimated EBITDA. The stock is currently trading at around 14X 2011 estimated EBITDA, and Stephens believes that this valuation is rather full. During today's trading session, VMC is 0.92% higher to $49.54."

2010-05-03,"Jim’s Game Plan For This Week (SMG, CLNE, CPNO, JDSU, APA, DVN, RIG, MRK, PFE, SHOO, SBA, AMT, VMC, SYY)","According to an article on CNBC, Jim Cramer said that while the last week was tough, this week is going to be much better. I think when the Federal government reports how many people were hired in April ... we are going to see a significant decline in unemployment, Cramer said. You're going to hear about this number of jobs created or that number — here's what we watch on Mad Money. We don't care about that creation number, we're looking at the households report. It's a much better indicator, and if we see a number that indicates we're headed lower to 9.5, 9.2, 9.1 percent on unemployment, I suspect you'll see a substantial rally in the markets and most importantly, the banks. Yup, the very banks that were taken down so wrongly today due to ill-conceived chatter stemming from financial regulatory reform, he elaborated. Jim said that although details will say it all, he had not heard anything bad about this legislation and was excited to get some clarity this month. He did not think that traders need to wait for the numbers to be reported on Friday to buy stocks. After the beating the stocks took last Friday, the bank stocks are likely to rally of their own accord. However, if I am right and the household number shows a big downtick in unemployment, and if a consensus on financial reform begins to develop next week, as I believe it will, you could have the beginning of a monster rally in the financials, Cramer added. Jim believes that one should look for restaurant supplier Sysco (NYSE: SYY) and from aggregate giant Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC) today. Cramer said these stocks were important as, First, we've had an incredible bull market going on in restaurants ... and Sysco will give us a heads up... on if it will continue.” As for Vulcan, this company has been saying there are no stimulus dollars. They haven't filtered down to where crushed rocks are being bought... I think that’s starting to change and we’ll be impressed with the quarter, although the stock has run already in all fairness. Jim advised traders to watch out for Steve Madden (NASDAQ: SHOO) on Tuesday. We think the Shoobie’s going to show why we believe the shoe bull market is not only alive and well but scorching, Cramer said. Speaking of scorching, we know that we need more cell towers... as our telco infrastructure morphs from a network that was built to handle terrestrial voice traffic to a wireless data and video world, and if we are right then we could hear great things from cell tower companies American Tower (NYSE: AMT) and SBA Communications (NYSE: SBA).” Jim mentioned that the drug sector seemed to have bottomed last Thursday. He expects Merck (NYSE: MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), both of which are set to report tomorrow, to confirm “what I think may be a nascent bull market. Transocean (NYSE: RIG), which is due to report Wednesday, will defend itself for not being responsible for spewing barrels of crude. Although Cramer doubted that anyone will listen to the company’s excuses, he tells traders, When this mess gets cleaned up you need to buy Transocean, you gotta buy it before it's cleaned up, so let’s listen in to hear how much of the business is non-gulf. Speaking of the gulf, Cramer noted that the market’s been hating Devon (NYSE: DVN) ever since it sold its Gulf properties to Apache (NYSE: APA). All I can say... is it's better to be lucky than good, and I think Devon’s going to surprise us on Wednesday with how much natural gas it has found, and how cheaply it has found it, Cramer added. Although JDS Uniphase (NASDAQ: JDSU) is stuck at $13, Jim thinks it is ready to bust out to the upside. Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ: CLNE), Copano Energy (NASDAQ: CPNO) and Scotts Miracle-Gro Co (NYSE: SMG) are the stocks to look for on Thursday. While CLNE is set to soar if the legislation passes, SMG could be one of the biggest upside surprises of all when it reports Thursday. Cramer said. Jim thinks that every stock is at risk until the unemployment report comes out on Friday. Cramer was bullish and said, “If I'm right, we’ll be headed toward Dow 12,500 after this cleansing sell-off... If I am wrong, I still think that these trades I describe will work, but the upside will be muted so, please, do not be greedy. Read more on Jim Cramer."

2010-08-03,Vulcan Misses Expectations - Analyst Blog,"Vulcan Materials Co. (VMC) posted a profit of $20.5 million or 15 cents per share (excluding charges related to settlement of a lawsuit in Illinois and to flooding in Nashville, Tennessee) in its second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at 24 cents per share. In the year-ago period, the company's profit stood at $15.6 million or 14 cents per share. Although the company witnessed higher Aggregates volume, it was adversely affected by higher unit costs for liquid asphalt and diesel fuel as well as lower product pricing during the quarter. Average price for aggregates fell 2% while unit cost for diesel fuel and liquid asphalt increased 38% and 26%, respectively during the quarter. Total revenues in the quarter rose marginally by 2% to $736.2 million. Operating profit declined to $41.2 million (excluding charges related to settlement of a lawsuit in Illinois) from $65.7 million in the prior-year period. Revenues in the Aggregates segment inched up 4% to $471.5 million. Earnings in the segment was negatively affected by a 2% decrease in aggregates prices and a 38% increase in the unit cost for diesel fuel, which more than offset the positive impact from a 6% rise in shipments. Revenues in the Concrete segment dipped 8% to $105 million due to an 11% fall in average selling price. Earnings in the segment was positively affected by higher shipments of ready-mixed concrete and lower costs, which were more than offset by a decrease in the average selling price. Revenues in the Asphalt Mix segment were almost flat at $103.5 million due to 5% decrease in selling prices, offset by a 2% rise in unit shipments. Earnings in the segment were lower than the year-ago level due to a 26% rise in the unit cost for liquid asphalt and lower selling prices. Revenues in Cement segment slashed 53% to $12.7 million due to a 22% fall in selling prices. However, earnings in the segment were slightly lower than the prior-year level as lower average selling prices offset higher sales volumes. Vulcan had cash and cash equivalents of $42.2 million as of June 30, 2010, flat compared to the year-ago level of $43.7 million. Long-term debt amounted to $2.43 billion as on that date. The long-term debt to capitalization ratio stood at 37.5%, down from the year-ago level of 39%. In the first half of the year, Vulcan’s net cash flow from operating activities decreased significantly to $18.7 million from $169.4 million in the year-ago period due to a decline in net income. Meanwhile, capital expenditures reduced to $42.2 million from $60.1 million a year ago. In the second half of 2010, Vulcan expects Aggregates shipments to be flat to up 5% from the prior year. In the Asphalt segment, the company expects sales volumes and segment earnings to be almost the same as that of the last year. In the Concrete segment, the company expects sales volumes to increase from the prior year period but pricing to decline due to competitive pressures. In the cement segment, the company expects to incur a loss compared to the breakeven results reported in the prior year. Vulcan Materials, a Zacks #3 Rank (Hold) stock, is engaged in the production, distribution and sale of construction aggregates, and other construction materials and related services in the U.S. and Mexico. It is the nation’s largest producer of construction aggregates and a leading producer of other construction materials. VULCAN MATLS CO (VMC): Free Stock Analysis Report Zacks Investment Research"
2010-08-03,"Citi Rates Vulcan Hold, Has $47 Price Target (VMC)","Citi Investment Research is rating shares of Vulcan Materials Co (NYSE: VMC) a Hold and has a $47 price target after the industrial company reported weak earnings yesterday. In the report Citi Investment Research writes, We rate Vulcan Hold/High Risk (2H). While we continue to believe that the favourable long-term pricing story for aggregates remains in place, near-term trading conditions remain weak. Fiscal stimulus money and better residential markets will help this year, but private non-res and state work will continue to be a drag. In the medium to longer term, Vulcan's strategically positioned quarries provide it with a valuable and attractive asset from which to deliver value over the coming years. A stronger balance sheet reduces the financial risks within the group and puts more emphasis on the trading outlook for volumes and pricing. Near-term trading newsflow is expected to remain poor, but volumes and pricing may start to recover more meaningfully into 2011 and then the expected, significant leverage should be enjoyed. Shares of Vulcan Materials are down $3.66 to 43.19."
2010-08-03,Vulcan Materials Rated Hold At Jefferies After Disappointing Quarter (VMC),"Jefferies & Co. is keeping its Hold rating and $56 price target on Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC) after the industrial company reported disappointing earnings yesterday. In the report Jefferies writes, Yesterday evening (Monday 2 August) after markets closed, Vulcan reported Q2-2010 EPS of a loss of $0.19. This was well below our forecast ($0.24) and Bloomberg's estimate of consensus ($0.245). It goes on to say, Cautious on outlook. For its aggregates business, Vulcan is predicting that volumes in the second half will only be between flat and 5% higher on the same period last year and it expects prices to be similar to last year. In Asphalt, after a poor first-half, Vulcan expects its second-half volumes and profitability to be similar to last year. Shares of Vulcan are being hit hard, down $2.99 to $43.86."

2010-08-04,Citi Lowers Price On Vulcan Materials (VMC),"Citi Investment Research is lowering its price target on Vulcan Materials Co (NYSE: VMC) after the company missed earnings estimates.

In a note to clients, Citi writes, With EPS at a loss per share of $0.19 compared to consensus profit per share of $0.23 and our estimates of +$0.26. EBIT was down 41% to $39m and sales came in at $736m, up 2%. This compared to consensus of $84m and $759m respectively, while our estimates were slightly higher at $97m and $762m. A lawsuit settlement reduced EPS by $0.21, also. Further down in the research report, Citi goes on to say, We have reduced our profit estimates on the back of the weaker than expected Q2 results. Our EPS estimates are cut to -$0.74, -$0.06and $0.81 for 2010E, 11E and 12E. Aggregates pricing is a key swing factor for the actual outcome in profits from here, we have +2% for 2011E. On a 2011E EV/EBITDA of 15x we maintain our Buy rating but reduce our target price to $45 to reflect our lower estimates. We continue to like the business long term but short term pressure on earnings continues. Shares of Vulcan Materials are under pressure, down 99 cents to $41.57."

2010-08-06,"Bookkeeping: Short Whirlpool (WHR), Global Payments (GPN), Gentiva Health Services (GTIV), Covering TNA","It could go either way in the intermediate term so without a clear signal I am going to add a few more hedges to the short side. It looks like that 1106.44 gap won't fill today unless we get our patented HFT bum rush in the last 10-20 minutes, so I am going to cover my TNA. I made a quick 3.5% down from about 4.5% I had at the worst of the selloff.The shorts here are completely technical, unlike the longs which are a hybrid of fundamental and technical. Whirlpool (WHR) was a stock I attempted to short last year as I tried to fight Ben Bernanke's QE1, so perhaps this is ironic I am trying again. I am starting small with only a 0.9% exposure as the stock breaks below the 200 day moving average for the third major break in the past 45 days. It has been trending down for a few months, and the 20 day moving average has been a good place to short the past 6 weeks. That is currently up in the $87s, so while I am establishing a foothold I want to short more either on (a) a rally back to the 20 day or (b) a new low below $82. For now I am only allocating 0.9% this way - the stop out would be a break over the 20 day. Global Payments (GPN) miffed on earnings, but unlike most stocks I've been following rebounded immediately. It has now rallied back to its 20 day moving average, where it has been hanging around this week. That level is currently $38.14, and just a dollar higher we have the 50 day moving average which should provide another level of resistance. While familiar with the company this is the first time trading it long or short, so always a bit hesitant to go hog wild until you 'feel' how the stock acts day to day while owning it. I will begin with a 2% exposure, and a stop loss will trigger if the stock jumps over the 50 day moving average by a decent amount. Say $39.40ish. Gentiva Health Services (GTIV) - quite a similar chart to GPN, so I'll short with a 2% exposure here as well, and cover with maybe a 3.5% stop loss. In the scratch my head category I have had a limit order to short Vulcan Materials (VMC) at $48.00 for many weeks, and it did not hit back in late July despite touching that level. Perhaps there was not enough volume to trigger the trade, but this would have been an excellent hedge. Unfortunate. In the darn it category, I had a short on Ross Stores (ROST) out about a month ago, and it turned against me, stopping me out. Once I covered I did not look back until today. Unfortunate.

2010-08-09,Vulcan Faces Credit Rating Cut - Analyst Blog,"Vulcan Material Co.’s (VMC ) corporate credit rating has been pruned to “BBB-” from “BBB” by the Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P). S&P assesses that the company’s performance will not match the expectations for the upcoming quarters. Its rating outlook, however, stays “stable”. The rating agency pointed out that the company’s second quarter operating earnings and EBIDTA underperformed expectations. The miss was largely due to lower aggregate pricing, higher fuel costs and higher cost of liquid asphalt. Aggregate shipments failed to mitigate the negative impacts. However, the stable outlook is maintained as the second half of 2010 is expected to show some improvement. Increased highway and infrastructure spending may add substantially to the company’s volume and hence, profitability. The high interdependence between the currently unstable housing and the construction industries has caused the latter to suffer. The housing markets of Florida and California are among the worst affected, which constitute Vulcan’s biggest markets. Moreover, increased competition from companies such as Cemex (CX), Cement Roadstone Holdings (CRH), Lafarge Coppee SA (LFRGY) and Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (MLM) will also pose serious problems for Vulcan’s business in the near future. The company has recently started shifting its focus from private projects to public ones such as highways, roads and bridges. Such projects deliver both certainty and consistency in terms of business and income even in the case of economic fluctuations. Vulcan recorded a net profit of $20.5 million or 15 cents per share in the second quarter ended on June 30, 2010 compared with the year-ago profit of $15.6 million or 14 cents per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents per share.

2010-09-08,3 Sectors That Would Benefit From Another Stimulus Bill,"Congress is currently discussing another stimulus package. This one would not be like the first package which was loaded with tax cuts and spending on healthcare, information technology, and education. This package would go directly to improving our bridges, highways, dams, and tunnels. If Congress does pass a $50 billion dollar infrastructure stimulus bill, these are the sectors that would benefit the most. Industrial stocks Chicago Bridge & Iron (CBI), Jacobs Engineering (JEG), Foster Wheeler (FWLT), and Manitowoc (MTW) are a few of my favorite companies in this sector. These companies have their hands in every stage of the construction and engineering process. Both firms would benefit substantially from an infrastructure stimulus package. Materials Manufacturer Stocks Vulcan Materials(VMC), Eagles Materials (EXP), Martin Marietta (MLM), and Astex Industries (ASTE) all produce the materials that are used for industrial and commercial construction. These materials are used to cementing and asphalting roads and highways. Metals Producer Stocks The federal government may issue the money but they can’t complete their projects without basic materials. Steel will be needed from the nation’s largest steel producers. That includes companies like U.S. Steel (X), AK Steel (AKS), Nuecor (NUE) and Mittal Steel (MT). The first stimulus plan should have had more spending in the infrastructure arena. Although this plan is only for $50 billion dollars, it should help tp boost the revenues of many of these companies. It may be abit late but I suppose that something is better than nothing at all.

2010-10-15,Stocks Going Ex Dividend the First Week of November,"Here is our latest update on the stock trading technique called 'Buying Dividends'. This is the process of buying stocks before the ex dividend date and selling the stock shortly after the ex date at about the same price, yet still being entitled to the dividend. This technique generally works only in bull markets. In flat or choppy markets, your have to be extremely careful. In order to be entitled to the dividend, you have to buy the stock before the ex-dividend date, and you can't sell the stock until after the ex date. The actual dividend may not be paid for another few weeks. WallStreetNewsNetwork.com has compiled a downloadable and sortable Excel list of the stocks going ex dividend during the next week or two. The list contains many dividend paying companies, all with market caps over $500 million, and yields over 2%. Here are a few examples showing the stock symbol, the ex-dividend date and the yield.Vulcan Materials Company (VMC) market cap: $4.7B ex div date: 11/2/2010 yield: 2.7%KB Home (KBH) market cap: $985.3M ex div date: 11/2/2010 yield: 2.3%Intel Corporation (INTC) market cap: $107.6B ex div date: 11/3/2010 yield: 3.3%FirstEnergy Corp.

The ex-dividend date is normally set for stocks two business days before the record date. Payment date: the day on which the dividend payment is actually made, which can be as long at two months after the ex date.Don't forget to reconfirm the ex-dividend date with the company before implementing this technique.Disclosure: Author does not own any of the above at the time article was written.

2010-11-01,Vulcan Materials Falls 6% After Hours (VMC),"Shares of Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) were down 6% at $34.01 per share, after the company released financial results on Monday after the market closed that missed Wall Street earnings estimates.

In asphalt, trailing twelve month shipments have been relatively stable for the last 4 months. Vulcan Materials Company (VMC) finished the trading day at $36.20 per share.

2010-11-02,OEX Put/Call Ratio Spiked in Morning  11-02-2010,"Cusick's Corner The market will be watching the early polls, but I do not anticipate much action before the final exit polls start rolling in tonight. One interesting sentiment piece, the OEX Put/Call ratio (OEX is an index at the CBOE that tracks the S&P 100) spiked to 1.44. This is interesting because the OEX is typically where larger institutional clients trade and early this morning there seemed to be an influx of put purchases. It has pulled back into the midday to .72, but it was an interesting move on the open, especially in front of some potentially bullish election results in the wings. See you After Hours. Major averages are holding gains, but the underlying tone of trading remains somewhat cautious ahead of mid-term election results and a Fed meeting on interest rates. With no economic news to guide the morning action, some of the early focus was on a weakening dollar, which in turn helped lift crude oil and gold. Crude added $1.07 to $84.02 and gold gained $1 to $1,351.60 an ounce. Investor appetite for riskier assets is also driving gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which added 75 points, and the NASDAQ, now up 21. However, uncertainty about results from the mid-term elections and the Fed's stimulus plans seems to be keeping the rally in check. The Federal Reserve will wrap up its meeting tomorrow afternoon and perhaps offer greater clarity about its efforts to stimulate economic activity. While the market is falling into wait-and-see mode, there seems to be optimism that neither the Fed nor the elections will hold any unpleasant surprises. Not only are stocks up, but the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) has eased .43 to 21.40. Options volume is respectable. 3.5 million calls and 2.5 million puts traded by 12:15 ET. Bullish Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) is up amid relative strength in the sector Tuesday morning. The SPDR Homebuilder ETF (XHB) is up .42 to 15.94. Lennar is leading the way. Shares are up $1.07 to $15.93 and options volume is 3.5X the average daily, with about 27,000 calls and 4,550 puts traded on the ticker. The action is mostly across November, December and January 16 and 17 calls. The relative strength in the stock and the increased call activity appears to be related to speculation of a possibly buyout of the homebuilder. It's unsubstantiated, but seems to be the catalyst for the unusual action. ADP shares have added five cents to $44.77 and options volume is at 6X the average daily, with one investor apparently buying the November 44 – December 46 call spread at 70 cents, 5000X. This looks like a rolling of a position opened on September 30 when 5000 November 44 calls traded at the 44-cent ask price. The stock is up 6.5 percent since then and the calls are in-the-money. The investor is exiting the position and opening a new bullish trade in the December 46 calls. Bearish Retailer Kohl's (KSS) is off 7 cents to $51.57 and options volume is double the usual levels, with 3,710 puts and 2,610 calls trade in the name so far. November 50 puts are the most actives. 2,780 traded so far. November 55 and January 60 calls are seeing interest as well. It looks like players are taking positions in anticipation of volatility in the shares. It might be a play on monthly same store sales results, normally released on the first Thursday of the new month. Sara Lee (SLE) was the subject of a sizeable put spread Tuesday morning. Shares added 39 cents to $14.64 and one investor apparently sells 10,000 November 14 puts to buy 10,000 December 14 puts. This time spread looks like a new position and one that does well if shares hold above $14 through November (two and half weeks) and then fall from that point forward. Earnings will be a factor. The company is due to report on November 10 and before the November expiration. Unusual Volume Movers ADM options volume is running 5X the usual, with 35,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 52 percent of the activity, according to data from website WhatsTrading.com. Crown Castle (CCI) options activity is running 12X the usual, with 31,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 95 percent of the volume. TEVA options volume is 2.5X the typical levels, with 26,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 57 percent of the activity. Increasing volume is also being seen in Rackspace (RAX), Electronic Arts (ERTS), and Vulcan Materials (VMC). Implied Volatility Movers Rackspace (RAX) has seen a day of heavy trading and increasing implied volatility. Shares rallied at the open after CEO Michael Dell said his company is looking to buy a company in the cloud computing space, which raised speculation that DELL might bid for RAX. However, RAX came off its best levels after DELL announced plans to buy privately held Boomi instead. Nevertheless, trading in Rackspace remains brisk. 16,000 calls and 7,835 puts traded. Shares are now up 75 cents to $26.11 and implied volatility up 14 percent to 66."
2010-11-02,Vulcan Profits Plummet - Analyst Blog,"Vulcan Materials Company (VMC) showed a 78% fall in profit to $10.59 million in the third quarter of 2010 from $47.92 million in the corresponding quarter of the prior year. On earnings per share basis, profits of 8 cents were significantly down from 38 cents in the third quarter of 2009 and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. Total revenues in the quarter slid 4.5% to $743.2 million, which was higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $733 million. Operating profit declined to $50.43 million from $82.7 million in the prior-year period. The decline in sales and earnings were attributable to an industry-wide strike by construction workers at Illinois in the month of July, which led to a year-over-year decline in shipments as well as a dip in average unit price of the company's products. Segment Details Revenues in the Aggregates segment slipped 3% to $469.54 million as shipments declined 2.6% to 43,393 tons due to industry-wide strike in July and average price fell $2 to $10.18. Consequently, earnings decreased by $8.1 million to $125.13 million. Revenues in the Concrete segment dipped 12% to $105.05 million due to a 4.5% fall in shipments to 1,137 tons and 9% drop in average selling price to $87.62. The segment reported a wider loss of $10.07 million in the quarter compared with $604,000 a year ago. Revenues in the Asphalt Mix segment shrank 7% to $115.79 million due to a 3% decrease in both shipments to 2,258 tons and in average selling price to $50.62. Earnings in the segment were $13.44 million, which was lower than the year-ago level by $7.89 million. Revenues in the Cement segment slashed 11% to $9.42 million due to a fall in shipments by 40 tons to 218 tons and a decline in average selling price by 15% to $79.56. The segment reported a loss of $1.75 million in contrast to a profit of $521,000 in the year-ago quarter. Financials Vulcan had cash and cash equivalents of $82.5 million as of September 30, 2010, an increase from $46.55 million in the corresponding quarter-end of the previous year. Long-term debt amounted to $2.76 billion as of the above date, reflecting a long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 41%. This was higher than the year ago level of $2.57 billion and 39%. The company aims to reduce total debt by $120 million by the end of 2010. In the first nine months of the year, Vulcan's net cash flow from operating activities decreased significantly to $127.83 million from $354.82 million in the year-ago period due to a decline in profit. Meanwhile, capital expenditures reduced to $62.1 million from $94.17 million a year ago. The company expects capital spending to be less than $100 million for full year 2010, down from the previous outlook of $125 million. Vulcan Materials, a Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) stock, is engaged in the production, distribution and sale of construction aggregates, and other construction materials and related services in the U.S. and Mexico. It is the nation's largest producer of construction aggregates and a leading producer of other construction materials. VULCAN MATLS CO (VMC): Free Stock Analysis Report Zacks Investment Research"

2010-11-18,Homebuilding Demolished! - Zacks Industry Rank Analysis,"Industry Rank Analysis 11-18-10 The Construction industry has been demolished over the last few years, and it does not look like it will be rebuilt anytime soon. Housing starts are down about 75% from peak levels and are below year-ago levels, and a year ago things were pretty depressed. Historically, residential investment is the locomotive that pulls the economy out of recessions. The fact that the locomotive is derailed is the primary reason this recovery has been so sluggish. Several of the firms related to homebuilding -- either the homebuilders or the suppliers of building materials -- are showing up as among the very worst, based on the Zacks Rank. The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 256 different industries tracked. It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well -- a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts. What is interesting is when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list. The same holds true for the bottom of the list. Four “industries” in the overall Home Construction industry are showing up very poorly based on the Zacks Rank. The worst of the bunch are the cement makers, coming in 245th place (tie) out of the 256 industries tracked, a deterioration of 30 spots from last week. The average Zacks Rank for the seven firms in the group rose (rising is bad) to 3.71 from 3.29. Right behind them are the miscellaneous building products in 244th place, slipping 3 spots from last week with an average score of 3.68 vs. 3.63 last week. The Heating and Air Conditioning industry is in 230th place, an improvement of one slot from last week with an average score of 3.50 (unchanged). Finally are the Homebuilders themselves, in 212th place, a deterioration of 28 spots from last week as the average score rose to 3.31 from 3.15. The first table below shows the Homebuilding and related stocks that hold the dreaded Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell). The second table shows the Zacks #4 Ranked (Sell) firms. There is a range of market capitalizations to choose from between the two lists, although most are in the small- to mid-cap area. That might make it difficult to short these firms, and they might not have options available which would make the “buy a put” strategy impossible to implement, but that is not true for all of these firms. In addition to the weak estimate momentum, the valuations on these firms are not particularly appealing (a NA indicates and expected loss for the period). There will be a time to own these names, but now is not the time.

It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks Industry Rank is. The Zacks Industry Rank is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800 lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank. Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list. After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank of #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 255 industries tracked. The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Thus, I do not always focus on the very highest rated industries, but on the highest rated ones in which there are a large number of firms.

Just six weeks ago, Vulcan Materials was trading in a beautiful sideways base in the $36.00 range at 52 week lows. You can see this base in the chart below. As the material, commodity plays blasted higher, finally Vulcan Materials took off. Since that base bottom level, it has jumped to a high of $46.52. While it is extremely extended, the chart is just now coming into the first major resistance area. This level is at a price of $46.85. If the stock pushes through this point, look for the mega point of resistance to be the double top at $48.00. Gareth Soloway Chief Market Strategist www.InTheMoneyStocks.com"

2010-12-17,Vulcan Materials Co. (VMC) - Bear of the Day,"Despite being the largest producer of construction aggregates and a leading producer of other construction materials, Vulcan Materials (VMC) faces intense competition and a challenging environment. The nearly stalled construction business has yet to show positive signs of recovery, jeopardizing the prospects of the building materials and other related products markets. In the most recent quarter, Vulcan failed to live up to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19 per share by posting a profit of only $0.08. In addition, its cash position has also deteriorated. Based on the above conditions, we continue with our Underperform recommendation on the stock and set a target price of $36.00.

2011-01-05,Crumbling Cement - Zacks Industry Rank Analysis,"Industry Rank Analysis 1-5-11 The spending from the Stimulus Bill (ARRA) is rapidly running out, and in the current environment it is highly unlikely to be renewed. A fairly significant part of the ARRA was spending on public construction projects such as roads and bridges. Construction in the private side of the economy is also far from robust. Not surprisingly, then, the Zacks Ranks of several building related industries are currently very weak. In this article I will focus on two of the industries that are among the worst -- Cement and Miscellaneous Building Products. I would point out that there are other related industries, such as the Building Products Retailers, Lighting Fixtures and the Home Builders themselves are not looking too good either. Also, the several of the steel-related industries look weak, and construction, particularly public and commercial, tend to also use a lot of steel. Cement demand is closely tied to public construction activity. Almost by definition, the Miscellaneous group is harder to characterize, but it appears that many of them are also sensitive to public construction, though they are often more tied to residential construction. Not that it really matters; both areas look pretty dicey for 2011. The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 255 different industries tracked. It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well -- a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts. It is interesting, however, when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list...or at the bottom. The Cement industry is about average size with 7 firms, although none of them are exactly mega caps. The industry is in 254th place of the 255 industries we track -- an unusually poor showing for an average-sized industry. It deteriorated by five spots over the last week. Its average Zacks Rank is 4.14, up (bad) from 3.71 last week. The Miscellaneous building products industry is bigger than with 17 firms in it. It is currently in the 229th spot on the list of industries with an average Zacks Rank of 3.35, although that is an improvement of 15 spots from last week when the average rank was 3.65. The first table below shows the Cement and Miscellaneous Building Products stocks that hold the dreaded Zacks #5 Rank (Strong Sell). The second table shows the Zacks #4 Rank (Sell) firms. Most of the firms are on the small side, and thus might be difficult to short, or not have options available to buy puts on them. There are a few larger firms on the #4 list, even if they are based abroad. In addition to looking ugly based on estimate momentum and surprises, none of these firms look particularly compelling on a P/E basis, even using 2011 earnings. An N/A in the P/E column means that the company is expected to be in the red that year. Expectations are falling fast, and an estimate in motion tends to remain in motion. In other words, the actual earnings could be much lower, and thus the true P/Es much higher. People buying these stocks have to be doing so on the hope of a turnaround. A Zacks score of #4 or #5 means that the turnaround is not likely to happen anytime soon. Turnaround situations that don't turn are the best stocks to avoid. In general, it is still to early to bet on a rebound in the construction sector, unless you have a very strong contrarian bent and a long investment time horizon.

It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks Industry Rank is. The Zacks Industry Rank is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800 lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank. Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list. After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank of #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 255 industries tracked. The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Thus, I do not always focus on the very highest rated industries, but on the highest rated ones in which there are a large number of firms.

2011-01-25,"Stock Market News for Jan 25, 2011  - Market News","A strong rally led by natural resources and tech shares helped markets to close in the green with the Dow nearing its psychological 12000 mark for the first time since June 2008. Tech stocks zoomed after chip maker Intel announced increased dividends and possible buy back of shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.92% to end at 11,980.52. The S&P 500 was up 0.58%, or 7.49 points, to close at 1,290.84 and, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.04% to 2,717.55. On the New York Stock Exchange, breadth of the market was on the positive side as for every 2,114 stocks that rose, 882 stocks ended in the red. Volumes were on the lighter side with only 7.02 billion shares traded, the lowest level recorded this year. Coming to the economic front, there were no releases on Monday that could have swayed the markets. However, the Treasury Department announced its plans to sell 465 million warrants in a order to purchase Citigroup shares, a move aimed at ending its $45 billion investment in Citigroup. A report from the National Association of Business Economics had helped natural resources and materials companies share prices rise after the report showed economists are more optimistic in their outlook about the job market and the economy. Consumer Confidence is later lined up for the day. Coming to earnings news, American Express (NYSE:AXP) announced earning reports after market hours. The company posted earnings of 94 cents on revenues of $7.32 billion slightly missing the Street's estimates. Share prices of bio-tech giant Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) fell 0.50% after the company reported their earning figures which slightly missed the Street's expectations. Shares of Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) rose by 0.92% after the company reported better than expected earnings results. Mc Donald's (NYSE:MCD) earnings figures was at par with expectations. Share prices of Mc Donald's rose 0.5%. Share prices of Texas Instruments (NYSE:TXN) fell 2.2% although the company posted better than expected results. On a sectoral basis, tech and natural resources stocks were the primary gainers in Monday's trade as chip maker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) raised its dividend by 15% and announced it was buying back shares worth $10 billion as a move to reward investors. Shares of Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) gained 2% after this development. Share prices of Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) rocketed up 11.4% to end at $24.76 after Barron's reported significant increase in the price of the stock, that could well be doubled in this year. Alcoa Inc's (NYSE:AA) share prices increased 4%, after the company's chief executive reported continued increased demand for aluminum in 2011. Share prices of Vulcan Materials Co.

2011-02-01,Jefferies Increases Its PT on Vulcan Materials to $52 (VMC),"Jefferies is out with its report today on Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC), raising its price target from $47 to $52. In a note to clients, Jefferies writes, Rolling our estimate of mid-cycle profitability to what it would be if it occurred in 2011, rather than in 2010, increases our price target to $52/share from $47. As the latter is 25% above the current share price, we maintain a Buy rating on the shares. Our 12-month price target of $52/share is based on our estimate of Vulcan's mid-cycle EBITDA of $1,117m, multiplied by our estimate of its future long-term EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.5. The main risks, in our view, are that real price increases may be difficult to sustain and volumes may recover at a different rate than we have assumed. At the time of posting, shares of VMC were trading at $43.61, up 2.47% from Monday's close."

2011-02-07,Notable Weakness in Small Caps  02-07-2011,"Cusick's Corner This market continued to hold up into the close with most of the major averages closing near the highs. However, there was some notable weakness in the Small Caps, IWM, which is a development to keep an eye on. I have referred to these high beta Small Caps as the proverbial canary in the coalmine, if they become weak could be a signal that potential pressure is emerging on an already extended market. This is not a signal of a complete reversal; we would need settlements below the Jan lows for me to be concerned about a deeper pullback. The EU is also flush with headlines out of Greece and Germany, a court ruling on IR swaps due out, potentially creating some implications for the Finance segment. See you Midday. Stock market averages finished with gains following a round of merger news Monday. Some of the media names saw increasing interest after AOL made a bid for web news site Huffington Post. Oil driller Pride International (PDE) rallied after Ensco (ESV) made a bid for the company. Meanwhile, Danaher (DHR) said it was buying medical equipment maker Beckman Coulter (BEC). The day's earnings news included better than expected results from Loewe's (L) and Lorillard (LO), and an earnings miss from Humana (HUM). The only economic data of the day showed Consumer Credit up $6.09 billion in December. Economists were expecting $2.5 billion. The data didn't move the market much. Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average opened higher on the merger news and spent the remainder of the session chopping sideways. At the closing bell, the Dow was up 70 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ had added 14.7. Bullish There was interesting action in homebuilder Pulte Homes (PHM) today. Shares finished the session up 7 cents to $7.61. Options volume was 9,050 calls and 1,005 puts. The action included several lots of January 7.5 calls traded at the $1.45, $1.46 and $1.47 asking price. It looks like one or more investors were accumulating positions during Monday's session and, at the end of the day, 5,508 contracts traded. March and July 8 calls saw interest. The January 2013 $15 calls even saw some interest. The homebuilder reported earnings Friday and, although the stock didn't really react and finished the day flat Friday, it appears that some investors now expect the stock to move higher in the months and years ahead. Bullish trading was also seen in Vulcan Materials (VMC), Gannett (GCI), and Calpine (CPN). Bearish Texas Instruments (TXN) sees a second day of increasing put volume. February 35 puts, March 34 puts and February 32 puts were active late Friday. Shares touched a new 52-week high Monday, but then gave up early gains to finish down 18 cents to $35.26. Meanwhile, 21,000 puts and 4,680 calls traded on the chipmaker. February 34 and 35 puts were the most actives. April 34 puts and calls were busy as well. It's not clear what is driving the heightened volume in TXN options. The company reported earnings on January 25 and the stock has been grinding steadily to new highs ever since. Bearish flow also surfaced in Seagate Technology (STX), Dean Foods (DF), and Mako Surgical (MAKO). Index Trading Trading volume picked up in the index market Monday, after several days of relatively slow trading the week before. 537,000 calls and 638,000 puts traded across the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) and other cash indexes, which is about the normal average daily volume, according to Trade Alert data. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) edged up .37 to 16.30, even as the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) added 8.2 points to 1,319.05. VIX normally moves lower when the S&P 500 tacks on a few points. Yet, the volatility index fell 20.5 percent last week. So, today's uptick in the VIX might be a bit technical in nature. Meanwhile, the top options trade in the VIX was interesting, after a block of 36,000 Feb 22.5 calls traded at 17 cents, which might be a buyer bracing for a short-term pop in market volatility. ETF Action An interesting spread traded in the iShares Small Cap Fund (IWM) this afternoon. Shares touched a new 52-week high Monday morning and finished the day up 79 cents to $80.66. In options action, one investor sold 40,000 March 75 puts at 76 cents, bought 20,000 March 78 puts at $1.35 and bought 20,000 March 72 puts at 43 cents. The position is a 1X2X1 March 78 – 75 – 72 put butterfly spread for a net debit of 26 cents. It's a bearish play, or maybe a hedge, as the spread offers its max pay-off if shares of the small cap fund fall to $75 through the March expiration, which is 7 percent over the next 39 days."

Excluding these the loss of $0.62 was double Jefferies estimate of $0.31, and $0.12 worse than the Bloomberg consensus of a loss of $0.50. The company has maintained the majority of its full year guidance, but has reduced its forecasts for its small cement business. Jefferies goes on to say, Vulcan has retained its forecasts for its aggregates business in 2011 of around a 2% increase in volumes and price increases of 1-3%. It continues to expect its asphalt earnings to increase, and the loss in its concrete business to be lower this year. However, Vulcan has reduced its expectations for its cement business, where it now expects its loss to be worse this year than in 2010, whereas three months ago it had expected a reduction in the loss.

2011-05-05,J.P. Morgan Comments On VMC Q1 Results,"J.P. Morgan is providing its initial take on Vulcan Materials Company's (NYSE: VMC) Q1 results. “Q1 EPS was -$0.50, in line with consensus, and below our -$0.38, due to a ~$15mm shortfall on the top line (vs. our estimate), as well as slightly lower EBIT margin (-670bps) than we forecast, reflecting an increase in energy and liquid asphalt prices,” J.P. Morgan writes. “Q1 EPS included a pre-announced $0.12/share gain from a favorable arbitration ruling that was factored into our forecast (a $0.08 gain was also included in discontinued ops). Free cash flow topped our forecast by $35mm, due in part to a favorable working capital swing.” Vulcan Materials Company closed Wednesday at $44.20."

As previously announced on June 14, 2011, the Company issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes due 2016 and $600 million of senior unsecured notes due 2021. Also, on June 14, 2011, consistent with the previously communicated intended use of proceeds from the Issuance, the Company purchased $275 million of senior unsecured notes in the Tender Offer. The total cash used for the Tender Offer, including the purchase price above par value of the notes, accrued interest, and fees & expenses, was approximately $298.3 million. Additionally, net proceeds from the Issuance will be used to prepay the Company's $450 million term loan due 2015 and reduce the outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. On June 14, 2011, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a consortium of banks to exchange the fixed rate on the $500 million notes due 2016 to floating rates in order to rebalance the fixed rate and floating rate interest mix toward the interest mix that existed prior to the Issuance and the resulting use of proceeds."

In its report, KeyBanc writes, We think VMC has a good overall portfolio of construction material businesses, albeit cyclically depressed, led by its aggregate operations. The Company's focus on reducing costs should provide solid operating leverage on incremental volume, but investor patience is warranted as we do not believe a strong recovery in demand will be a near-term catalyst, and higher debt leverage than in the past will also likely delay earnings for now.

2011-10-03,Bear Trend Still in Place  09-30-2011,"Cusick's Corner The swing in the market has led to a lot of frustration with traders and investors. This is like watching a fight between two kids, a lot of kicking and scratching but no punches thrown. This is one whippy consolidation and the downside is still in play until we can get over resistance, 1225 on the S&Ps, this would signal some relinquishment of the bears. So the take away this week is the bear trend is still in place, the velocity to the upside is the true risk due to the under investment in the market. The data this week has shown that the Consumer is still alive but the Discretionary names look to be under more pressure, XLY/XRT, and if this sector breaks this will take the equities down with them. The market is in a red mode so we need to tread lightly. See you next week. The European Debt Crisis was the primary driver for bearish action in the third quarter and that theme echoed on the final day of trading in September. Again, equity market losses across the Eurozone and a drip in the euro/US dollar currency pair set the table for weakness on Wall Street. Disagreement among EU officials about plans to resolve the debt crisis rekindled worries about potential mounting banking problems across the Atlantic. Germany's DAX paced the decline with a loss of 2.5 percent. The day's domestic economic news was not so bleak. Personal incomes fell .1 percent and spending rose .2 percent in August. Economists were expecting gains of .1 percent and .2 percent, respectively. However, the latest Chicago Purchasing Manager's Index [PMI] unexpectedly jumped to 60.4 in September, from 56.5 the month before and better than the 54.0 that was expected. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index finished September at 59.4, from 57.8 mid-month and better than the 57.5 that was expected. Yet, stocks were broadly lower on worries about Europe at midday and the decline gathered some additional momentum in the final hour. At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 241 points on the day and 12.1 percent for the quarter. Bullish Research In Motion (RIMM) lost 86 cents to $20.30 and fell to new 52-week lows on the final trading day of the third quarter. It has been a rough three months for the equity market as a whole and shares of many individual names, including RIMM. Shares of the Blackberry-maker are down almost 30 percent since June. RIM fetched more than $70 in February of this year. However, amid concerns about competition from iPhone and Android-based devices, the stock has come under fire in recent months. Yet, despite the bearish trend, at least one large player seems to be bracing for a bounce back in the months ahead. A 22,000-contract block of March 30 calls was bought on RIM today at $1.05 per contract. The trade looks opening because volume exceeds the existing open interest in the contract. If so, the strategist is making a statement that they want the right to buy the stock at $30 through March 2012. They're paying $105 per contract for the right, but not the obligation, to call 100 shares of stock at $30. If shares hold below that level and the position is held through the expiration, the contract expires worthless and the premium is lost. However, the call can be offset or sold at any time prior to the expiration. With many stocks falling to new 52-week and multi-month lows, some investors are taking positions in upside calls as a way to participate in a potential rebound, but without taking a position in the actual shares. Bullish trading was also seen in USEC (USU), Harbin Electric (HRBN), and Thoratech (THOR) Bearish Eastman Kodak (EK) shareholders had a rough month of September. The stock finished August at $3.18, but had fallen to $2.38 by last Friday, or roughly 25 percent. The stock came under fire again Monday and fell to $1.55 by Wednesday. EK added 14 cents yesterday, but tumbled 91 cents to only 78 cents per share today after Bloomberg reported that the company is exploring options, including a possible bankruptcy. Options on the 131-year old camera company saw heavy trading on the news. 48,000 calls and 52,000 puts traded, as some investors were probably bracing for a worse-case scenario - Kodak shares go to zero. October .5 puts, which are now 28 cents out-of-the-money and expire in 21 days, were the most actives. 11,825 traded. Bearish trading was also seen in Molex (MOLX), Vulcan Materials (VMC), and Coach (COH) Index Trading The volatility landscape changed dramatically during the third quarter 2011. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX), which tracks the expected volatility priced into S&P 500 Index (SPX) options, is trading up 2.86 to 41.70 late Friday. The index is sometimes called the market's fear gauge because it tends to spike during periods of high anxiety and negativity on Wall Street. The index finished the second quarter at just 16.52. It had risen to 25.25 by the end of July. VIX then rallied to 15-month highs of 48 on August 8 and has seen whippy action since that time. Still, a reading above 41.7 reflects the relatively high levels of uncertainty and anxiety that investors now face and heading into a historically volatile month of October. Meanwhile, the top options trades in the VIX pit today is an apparent October 40 - 45 bullish risk-reversal at $1.57, 13635X. Looks like the investor sold 45 calls at $4.05 to buy 40 puts at $2.48 and, if this is an opening play, it's a decisive bet that volatility will move higher through mid-October. It might also offset a bearish risk -reversal in the VIX. Still, the bullish play also reflects the high levels of investor and anxiety that surfaced during the third quarter 2011. ETF Action SPDR Consumer Discretionary ETF (XLY) is off 84 cents to $35.05 late Friday and has suffered a 12.8 percent loss in the third quarter. One player in the options market seems to be bracing for additional losses in the fund, as a December 27 - 33 put spread was bought on the XLY at $1.09, 15,000X. The strategist bought 15,000 Dec 33 puts at $1.59 and sold 15,000 Dec 27 puts at 5 cents, which is a bearish play that makes its best profits if shares fall another 23 percent and below $27 through the December expiration. An institutional investor might have initiated the trade to hedge exposure to the consumer discretionary sector, which includes names like Home Depot, McDonald's and Comcast."
2011-10-03,Market Doing Laundry  09-30-2011,"Cusick's Corner The market has headlines to absorb but it is not about the EU but rather China and the East are weighing on macro minds. There is some pressure on financial names, most notably Morgan Stanley (MS) (I have a small bear put spread in this name), due to exposure to Greece and French banks. This is what the market looks like after washing out the weak longs yesterday and squeezing out the weak longs today. We can now expect some chop into the close, especially with this being the end of the month today. The data this morning was a nonevent; I am sitting tight at this stage but looking to potentially add some bearish positions in Tech, looking at the chips right now. See you After Hours. The third quarter is ending on a down note. The table was set for losses on Wall Street Friday morning after stock indexes fell across the Eurozone and the euro lost 1 percent against the buck. Disagreement among EU officials about plans to resolve the debt crisis has rekindled worries about problems across the Atlantic. Germany's DAX paced the decline with a loss of 2.5 percent. The day's domestic economic news was mixed. Personal incomes fell .1 percent and spending rose .2 percent in August. Economists were expecting gains of .1 percent and .2 percent, respectively. However, the latest Chicago Purchasing Manager's Index [PMI] unexpectedly jumped to 60.4 in September, from 56.5 the month before and better than the 54.0 that was expected. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index finished September at 59.4, from 57.8 mid-month and better than the 57.5 that was expected. Yet, stocks are lower despite some improved economic data. Through midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 110 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 35.4. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) jumped 2.43 points to 41.27. Overall options volume is light and reflects the cautious underlying tone, with 4 million calls and 4.4 million puts traded across the exchanges through 12:45pm ET. Bullish Flow Bank of America (BAC) is down 2.4 percent to $6.20 and one of twenty-five Dow stocks under water midday Friday. BAC is set to close the third quarter not far from it's 52-week low of $6 set intraday on September 22. Shares of the banking giant lost 43.5 percent for the quarter. At least one player in the options market seems to be anticipating a rebound over the next several quarters and initiated a bullish longer-term play on the bank Friday morning. The investor bought a 19,000-contract block of January 2013 $7.5 calls on BofA at $1.52 per contract. The 7.5 call is now 21 percent out-of-the-money and, if bought at $1.52, has an upside breakeven at expiration at $9.02 (+53.6%). The investor might be anticipating a rebound in the bank during the fourth quarter and throughout 2012, but rather than buying stock they are buying the right to purchase or call the stock at $7.5 per share. USEC (USU), a Bethesda, MD provider of uranium to power plants, is down 11 cents to $1.68. Shares are falling to new 52-week lows today and are down 51 percent since July. Options volume today includes 6,300 calls and 540 puts. The action is focused on October - November 2.5 call spread trading, in which the strategist was selling Oct 2.5s at a nickel and buying Nov 2.5s for 25 cents. It appears to be rolling activity. That is, the strategist is closing out a bullish position in October 2.5s, which are now almost 50 percent out-of-the-money. They're buying Nov 2.5s to open and giving the trade one more month to play out. Bearish Flow Vulcan Materials (VMC) shares are trading down $1.10 to $27.84 and options volume in the Birmingham, AL building materials company is running 4X the daily average. 12,000 puts and 2,150 calls traded in VMC so far. The top trades are part of a spread, in which the strategist apparently sold 2,500 November 37 puts at $10.22 and bought 2,500 November 32 puts at $6.20. The spread, for a $4.02 net credit, has traded 5,000X and is probably rolling down in strikes. After a 38.4 percent decline in VMC shares since April, the strategist is exiting a profitable position (or protective put hedge) in the deep in-the-money 37s and now opening a new one in the 32s, which are not so far in-the-money. iShares Dow Jones Real Estate ETF (IYR) is down 61 cents to $51.33 and one strategist initiates a November 50 - 45 put spread on the fund at $1.40, 5000X. That is, Nov 50 puts were bought at $2.75 and Nov 45s sold at $1.35. The spread offers its best payoff if shares fall an additional 12.3 percent through the November expiration (49 days). IYR is a fund that holds a basket of Real Estate Investment Trusts [REITs] and shares of companies involved in the real estate market. Shares lost 14.8 percent in the third quarter and today's spread trader seems to be bracing for additional losses to start the fourth. Unusual Volume CREE options volume is running 3X the (22-day) average, with 65,000 contracts traded and call activity accounting for 59 percent of the volume. Focus Media (FMCN) options volume is 3X the average daily, with 24,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 73 percent of the activity. Ingersoll Rand (IR) options volume is running 5X the average daily, with 20,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 63 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Cemex (CX), UBS, and Vulcan Materials (VMC). Implied Volatility Mover CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) is moving, as investors close the books on a rocky third quarter and now brace for the historically volatile month of October. VIX started moving higher in July and then saw a spike to 15-month highs of 48 on 8/8. The volatility index is up 1.92 to 40.76 today and set to finish the quarter with a gain of almost 150 percent. The volatility index finished June at 16.52, but due to concerns about the European Debt Crisis, bank exposure to loans, and a slowing global economy, risk perceptions are sharply higher at the end of September."

2011-12-12,Is the Vulcan Materials Acquisition Likely? ,"Turbulent markets often prevent financial transactions from taking place. For example, when equity markets are extremely violent, companies are wary of issuing public equity securities. The same principle affects the debt capital markets. Mergers and acquisitions are also affected severely, as they often require large obligations to be undertaken by the acquiring company. During uncertain times, companies that do end up taking over other entities often do so with fierce conviction. Whether a company is a strategic or financial buyer, it should have several reasons for why a company is a good target. Recently, Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM) offered Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC) $4.7 billion in a hostile bid. While the merger is far from confirmed, investors must consider why the merger should occur in the first place. For a strategic buyer like Martin Marietta, one of the first things it should consider is how the acquisition will improve existing market share. The first thing to notice is that both companies offer similar, yet different, products. Vulcan Materials is a large producer of asphalt and other cement products, while Martin Marietta manufactures chemical and lime-based products. Vulcan also operates in various states including California, Virgina, Florida, and Texas. Martin Marietta currently operates in Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, Iowa, and Louisiana. While there may be some overlap in Texas' operations, the value added from the other states is likely to outweigh the cons. Investors should also consider if the acquisition is likely to save costs. Since the companies produce fairly similar products, they may be able to streamline costs by consolidating work forces or factories. Reducing overhead is extremely likely in this particular case. One of the few downsides to this is that certain jobs will probably be made redundant, and workforce downsizing may be imminent. Martin Marietta Materials also has to consider various financial characteristics underlying Vulcan Materials' business model. For example, the way Vulcan funds its operations is extremely important. Acquirers want to see cash flow positive companies that do not necessarily fund itself via extensive debt and equity issuances. Vulcan has a history of consistent debt and equity issuances, but appears to have calmed down recently as far as capital markets activity goes. Vulcan Materials' financial situation could be more positive, but it has consistently paid back its debt. It has also been able to boost overall cash flows over the last several years, with no help from financing activities. Balance sheet modifications in working capital along with depreciation add-backs bolstered cash flows. Inventories and stock-based compensation were two key drivers, and both appear to have affected the company positively over the last five years. Vulcan Materials and Martin Marietta Materials have a long way to go before ironing out all the details behind the possible acquisition, but it may seem to be a good match. The strategy behind the acquisition appears to identify key synergies that may be able to skyrocket both companies in the industrials sector. Moreover, the two would be able to combine existing resources to efficiently mold both companies into one entity. Martin Marietta Materials is currently trading at about $75.75, down 18.5% for the year. Vulcan Materials Company is currently trading at about $39.05, down 28% for the year . ACTION ITEMS:Bullish View:Traders who believe that the Vulcan Materials/Martin Marietta acquisition will complete might want to consider the following trades: Long Vulcan Materials by purchasing shares or call options. Vulcan currently appears to be close to a technical support level, so now may be a good time to buy.Short another similar company, like US Concrete (NASDAQ: USCR). You could short this company to hedge a long VMC trade or to accentuate your belief that Vulcan Materials will continue to dominate the asphalt production market.Long an ETF like the Industrials SPDR (NYSE: XLI). If a significant industry like construction is doing well, industrials itself will probably do well.Bearish View:Traders who believe that the acquisition will not take place may consider the following positions:Short Vulcan Materials until it reaches $34, which is the level it was at before the unsolicited offer by Martin Marietta Materials; it also appears to be a technical support level. The next support level appears to be at about $31.Long a competitor like Texas Industries (NYSE: TXI), as someone bearish on Vulcan may believe that a specialized competitor is more likely to garner market share.Buy put options as Vulcan Materials' earnings announcement comes along.

2011-12-19,From Earlier: Martin Marietta Materials Sends Letter to Board of Directors of Vulcan Materials Company  ,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) on Saturday announced that it has delivered a letter to the Board of Directors of Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC). The full text of the letter is below: I am writing to you, the Board of Directors of Vulcan Materials Company, regarding the proposal Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. announced on December 12, 2011 to combine with Vulcan. In part the purpose of this letter is to provide you with additional context regarding our views on the combination as you are considering our proposal. In addition, I am quite concerned that Vulcan's position as presented in the court papers filed by Vulcan late on Friday in the Superior Court of New Jersey seriously mischaracterizes the transaction we have proposed and rejects it even though, according to the papers, Vulcan's Board of Directors has not taken a public position on Martin Marietta's proposal. Statements in Vulcan's New Jersey court papers that our proposal is an attempt “to snatch Vulcan for the lowest possible price and on [Martin Marietta's] own terms”, and is “burdened…with a bevy of conditions that make…any closing unrealistic” are simply inaccurate. The offer we announced on December 12th gives Vulcan shareholders the means to realize the substantial benefits resulting from a combination of our two companies. The sole meaningful obstacle would be Vulcan Board opposition if the Board chooses that path. On that point, the court papers state that “the approval of Vulcan's board of directors …has no likelihood of being satisfied any time in the foreseeable future, if ever.” (Emphasis added.) This is a remarkable statement on behalf of a Board of Directors that purportedly has not taken a public position on our proposal. If true, this acknowledged predetermination by the Vulcan board to refrain from engaging in meaningful discussions with Martin Marietta clearly is contrary to the best interests of Vulcan and its shareholders. Indeed, it seems likely that a prolonged process would destroy value for Vulcan shareholders, who could lose the opportunity to receive much earlier or completely an up-front premium, reinstatement of a meaningful dividend, and the transformation of their investment in Vulcan into a 58% stake in a combined company that is decidedly stronger – financially, operationally and strategically. As to our views on the combination, in developing our proposal to combine the businesses of Martin Marietta and Vulcan, we carefully considered many factors from the standpoint of the shareholders of both companies. We recognized that our proposed transaction must be value-enhancing both to the Vulcan shareholders and the Martin Marietta shareholders. The exchange ratio of 0.50 of a Martin Marietta share for each Vulcan share, and the resulting 58% / 42% equity split between Vulcan's and Martin Marietta's shareholders in the combined company, reflect the value contributed by each company. We believe the combination on the terms proposed presents a compelling value-enhancing opportunity for the shareholders of both companies. This combination is a rare opportunity and, unless evidence of additional value is presented by Vulcan, is one that both companies should pursue on the terms proposed. As we have repeatedly said, our strong preference is to negotiate an agreement with Vulcan that will benefit both sets of shareholders. We are not dissuaded by what may be intemperate rhetoric of litigation. We look forward to your response and to commencing discussions in order to effect this compelling, value-enhancing opportunity."

2011-12-20,From Earlier: Vulcan Materials Streamlines Organizational Structure; Expected to Save $30M Annually ,"Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) today announced that it is consolidating its eight divisions into four operating regions as part of ongoing efforts to reduce overhead costs and increase operating efficiency. This initiative is expected to generate an ongoing annualized pre-tax cost savings of approximately $30 million, in addition to approximately $25 million in annual pre-tax overhead reductions already implemented in 2011. The initiative, which senior management began developing earlier in the year, was approved by Vulcan's Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled quarterly meeting on December 9, 2011, following a preliminary review of the Company's proposal at the Board's October 14, 2011 meeting."
2011-12-22,Martin Marietta Materials Responds to Vulcan Materials Company Announcement to Reject Exchange Offer   ,"Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) issued the following statement in response to today's announcement by Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC): Ward Nye, Martin Marietta President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The announcement made by Vulcan today in response to our business combination proposal does not change our view – and we believe, the view of many Vulcan shareholders – that our offer represents a compelling opportunity for Vulcan's shareholders and all of its other constituencies. Vulcan misses the point by ignoring the significant incremental value creation inherent in this combination. We are proposing a stock-for-stock merger combination in which Vulcan shareholders would own over 58% of the combined company and receive an upfront premium based on pre-announcement stock prices. The transaction would create a U.S.-based company that is the global leader in construction aggregates with a footprint reaching across North America. The combined company would be well-positioned for growth and success with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry and a dividend that is 20 times Vulcan's current level. Despite the rhetoric by Vulcan, the only real obstacle to delivering to Vulcan's shareholders the substantial benefits of the proposed combination is the opposition of Vulcan's Board of Directors. With the support of the Vulcan Board, our offer would be subject only to ordinary course conditions, and we have no reason to believe such conditions would not be satisfied on a prompt basis. In particular, as we have previously stated, we do not believe there are any significant regulatory or legal hurdles to completion of the proposed business combination. In addition, while we believe the proposed exchange ratio and equity split between Vulcan and Martin Marietta is appropriate and compelling, we would consider in good faith demonstrable evidence of additional value. “It remains Martin Marietta's strong preference to meet with Vulcan to engage in discussions in order to reach a definitive agreement to combine our two companies. Since announcing our proposal on December 12, 2011, we have spoken with a number of Vulcan shareholders, many of whom are also Martin Marietta shareholders, and we are pleased with the support we have received regarding the combination and the powerful financial and operational benefits it is expected to deliver. We are committed to completing this combination and are moving forward on a number of fronts to make it a reality. We encourage Vulcan shareholders to send a strong message to their Board that the proposed combination is a compelling opportunity for Vulcan's shareholders, customers, employees and communities,” Mr. Nye concluded. As previously announced, on December 12, 2011, Martin Marietta commenced an exchange offer in which each outstanding share of Vulcan will be exchanged for 0.50 Martin Marietta shares. The offer represents a premium for Vulcan shareholders of 15% to the average exchange ratio based on the closing share prices for Vulcan and Martin Marietta during the 10-day period ended December 9, 2011 and 18% to the average exchange ratio based on the closing share prices for Vulcan and Martin Marietta during the 30-day period ended December 9, 2011. Martin Marietta also intends to maintain the dividend for the combined company at Martin Marietta's current rate of $1.60 per Martin Marietta share annually, or the equivalent of $0.80 per Vulcan share annually, based on the proposed exchange ratio. This dividend rate is 20 times Vulcan's current level."

2012-01-05,"Martin Marietta Materials, Responds to Vulcan Materials Presentation   ","Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) today issued the following statement in response to the new shareholder presentation released by Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC). Vulcan's shareholder presentation suffers from numerous inaccuracies and mischaracterizations, which we will address promptly. Most importantly, the basic theme – the past is prologue to the future – is fundamentally flawed. “Pointing to past cyclical recoveries in this industry, Vulcan's presentation touts its performance on historical recoveries but in footnotes Vulcan admits that ‘historical performance is not a guarantee or assurance of future performance nor that previous results will be attained or surpassed.' “This last statement recognizes the reality that today's Vulcan is not the same company that came through the past cyclical recoveries."
2012-01-11,From Earlier: Vulcan Comments on Martin Marietta Presentation  ,"Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) issued the following statement on the shareholder presentation released by Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) today: Martin Marietta's presentation provides nothing new on the merits of its hostile offer. Vulcan held talks with Martin Marietta over many months and determined that a combination did not make economic sense for the Company and would not enhance value for Vulcan shareholders. Martin Marietta misrepresents the potential value from the combined company: its synergy assessment is unrealistically aggressive and it ignores the value destruction resulting from divestitures. Vulcan's assessment of antitrust risk makes use of its experience on the most relevant transactions in the industry, and Vulcan's assessment of its standalone prospects is based on analyst consensus views. We encourage our respective shareholders to carefully analyze the validity of Martin Marietta's claims. Vulcan will continue to meet with our shareholders and share our vision for Vulcan's future."
2012-02-12,Earnings Expectations for the Week of February 13,"Analysts expect to see double-digit per-share earnings growth from Agilent Technologies (NYSE: A), Apache (NYSE: APA), CBS (NYSE: CBS), Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA), DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV) and Marriot International (NYSE: MAR) when they report quarterly results this week. Other prominent reports on the schedule include those from Smucker (NYSE: SJM), Deere (NYSE: DE) and MetLife (NYSE: MET), which are forecast to post earnings growth as well, and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF), Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT), Campbell Soup (NYSE: CPB) and General Motors (NYSE: GM), from which a decline in earnings is anticipated. Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE: ANF) and Nordstrom (NYSE: JWN) kick off this season's crunch of retail earnings reports, which gets in full swing the following week. Fourth-quarter revenue for both of these retailers is expected to be more than 13% higher year over year. But while Nordstrom's EPS are forecast to be up 5.5% to $1.10, Abercrombie's are predicted to have slipped 18.8% to $1.12. Sixty days ago, Abercrombie's EPS estimate was $1.58, and it missed the consensus estimate in the previous quarter by nearly 20%. Avon Products (NYSE: AVP) is expected to say Tuesday that its earnings fell eight cents from a year ago to $0.51 per share and that revenues also fell marginally. Expectations are high for apparel maker VF Corp. (NYSE: VFC), though: fourth-quarter EPS up 22.9% to $2.31 and revenues up 36.1% to $2.9 billion. Analysts predict all four prominent media companies reporting this week will post earnings growth: CBS (NYSE: CBS) EPS up 13.2% to $0.53, Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) EPS up 17.1% to $0.41, DirecTV (NASDAQ: DTV) EPS up 19.6% to $0.92, Discovery Communications (NASDAQ: DISCA) EPS up 23.2% to $0.69. Full-year EPS forecasts for all four include strong year-over-year growth as well. But of the four, only CBS is expected to have weak revenue growth: flat for the quarter and up 2.2% for the year. And note that both Comcast and DirecTV fell short of consensus EPS estimates in the previous quarter. See also: Why Big Media Earnings May Beat Expectations. As mentioned above, Campbell Soup (NYSE: CPB) is forecast to report on Friday lower per-share earnings: down 12.7% from a year ago to $0.62 for the fourth quarter and 7.1% lower to $2.36 for the year. Revenues for the quarter and the full year are forecast to be about the same as a year ago. Analysts are a bit more optimistic about earnings from JM Smucker (NYSE: SJM) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group (NYSE: DPS). EPS for the former are predicted to be up 2.8% for the fiscal third quarter, while EPS for the latter are 10.7% higher for the fourth quarter and up 11.7% for the year. Note that Smucker's revenues are expected to be strong: more than 17% higher for the quarter. And fiscal third-quarter earnings for HJ Heinz (NYSE: HNZ) are estimated at $0.85 per share, about the same as a year ago, with revenues up 6.2%. Expectations for tech companies reporting this week are mixed. Analysts are looking for EPS that are between a nickel and a dime higher than a year ago from Agilent Technologies (NYSE: A) and NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP). But Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) are anticipated to say that EPS are down by double digits to $0.12 and $0.19, respectively. None of these four companies has fallen short of EPS estimates in the past five quarters. Revenues are forecast to be up between 7% and 23%, except for Applied Materials, which is expected to report a revenue decline. General Motors (NYSE: GM) is forecast to post $0.41 per share for the fourth quarter, its lowest EPS since remerging from bankruptcy. But revenues for the quarter are expected to be up 3.6% to $38.2 billion, and full-year EPS are estimated at $3.91, a 23.0% increase from a year ago. Also, Goodyear Tire (NYSE: GT) is expected to post higher EPS and revenues on Tuesday. See also: Will GM Ever Catch Up to Ford? In Wednesday's report, Deere's (NYSE: DE) earnings are predicted to have risen three cents to $1.23 per share, while revenue rose 17.6% to $6.5 billion. Independent energy company Apache (NYSE: APA) is expected to be one of the week's biggest earnings winners, with fourth-quarter EPS forecast to be 23.7% higher than a year ago to $2.87. But Waste Management (NYSE: WM) EPS is expected to be the same as a year ago, while Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC) is likely to post another net loss. And Marriot International's (NYSE: MAR) fourth-quarter EPS are anticipated be 17.0% higher year over year to $0.47, while those of MetLife (NYSE: MET) are forecast to have risen a dime per share to $1.24.

2012-05-16,Einhorn Brings The Pain on Martin Marietta ,"Shares of North Carolina-based Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM), a producer of granite, limestone, sand, gravel, and other products used for construction and infrastructure projects, plunged 8.2% today on volume that was roughly eight times the daily average after Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn made negative comments about the company at the Ira Sohn Conference. Martin Marietta was recently rebuffed in its hostile takeover bid for rival Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC), prompting comments from Einhorn that compared the company to Yahoo (Nasdaq: YHOO). Einhorn's bearish view of Martin Marietta forced a circuit breaker halt in trading of the stock this afternoon. The hedge fund manager, whose bearish bets include Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (Nasdaq: GMCR), Dick's Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS), and Herbalife (NYSE: HLF), compared Martin Marietta CEO Howard Nye to former Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson, calling Nye a megalomaniac along the way. With Tuesday's slide, shares of Martin Marietta have lost about 25% in the past three months."
2012-05-17,Martin Marietta Fights Back at Einhorn,"David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital is not a popular man within the offices of Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM), after he slammed the company at the annual Ira Sohn Investment Conference, causing it to instantly tank 10%. It is currently trading down 8%. Recent earnings benefited from one time fiscal stimulus that is about to wind down, Einhorn said at the conference, obviously deciding that MLM is his new favorite company to short. The rumor earlier in the day had been that Einhorn was going to short Herbalife (NYSE: HLF), but that company's stock is surging 9% on Thursday. The scary thing for MLM is that Einhorn is rarely wrong. He famously shorted Lehman Brothers just prior to that bank's demise, and more recently he shorted Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ: GMCR). However, Martin Marietta responded to the comments directly to Benzinga, telling us that, Unlike companies targeted by shorts, Martin Marietta has come through a challenging period for the industry by carefully managing capital and making disciplined operational decisions. We are profitable and have a solid balance sheet, which will allow us to capitalize on positive industry trends and positions us well for the future. If there is a bright side for MLM following Einhorn's unfavorable comments, it is that the potential $6.7 billion hostile takeover of Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC) which seemed all but dead earlier in May, may now be back on. The takeover was on the ropes after a Delaware court ruling and VMC;s insistence in staying independent, but Einhorn's intervention has resulted in traders betting that the deal will eventually go through. Einhorn's comments, bad enough for MLM, will also reflect badly on VMC, the other company at the top of the pile for producing construction aggregates or crushed gravel and stone that's used to build roads and other infrastructure. Most analysts seem to agree that, while Einhorn has not really done Martin Marietta any favors, he has hardly caused disastrous results either and the only thing that has really changed is what the company will have to offer to eventually acquire Vulcan Materials. The end of Wednesday's trading saw a close-to-identical share drop for Martin Marietta and Vulcan Matrials, plus an end-of-day merger spread of under $1. Still, the fact that remains that before MLM look to move forward with any deal, it will need to address all concerns that have been raised. Follow me @BCallwood."
2012-05-21,UPDATE: KeyBanc Capital Markets Upgrades Vulcan Materials Company to Buy,"KeyBanc Capital Markets has published a research report on Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) and has upgraded the company from Hold to Buy based on market improvement and valuation. In the report, KeyBanc Capital Markets writes, We upgrade our rating on Vulcan Materials Company (VMC-NYSE) from HOLD to BUY and establish a price target of $43 (8.5x mid-cycle EBITDA) based on the following: 1) shares trading at the low end of our fair value range; 2) a nascent recovery in VMC's cyclically depressed aggregates business; and 3) an improving balance sheet. We think the 29% pullback in shares since February 20 (vs. S&P down 5% over the same time frame) is over done and provides a compelling risk/reward for investors, in our opinion, as shares are not fully valuing a gradual improvement in construction end markets over time. The four-month court-ordered stoppage (until September) of Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.'s (MLM-NYSE) hostile bid for VMC temporarily eliminates noise related to a combination, but we think VMC will continue to trade closely with MLM (94% correlation since initial bid in December). KeyBanc Capital Markets has established a $43 price target on Vulcan Materials Company, which is currently trading up $1.01 from Friday's $34.59 closing price."
2012-06-11,"UPDATE: D.A. Davidson Reiterates Neutral Rating, Lowers PT for Vulcan Materials","In a morning research summary published earlier today, D.A. Davidson & Co. reiterated its Neutral rating for Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), but lowered its price target from $46.00 to $39.00. D.A. Davidson said its new price target “reflects 16x our fiscal 2012 EBITDA estimate, slightly higher than where the shares traded in the previous construction upturn of 10x-15x. Equity market pressure and Martin Marietta's blocked bid for the company have weighed on the shares. Macroeconomic concerns could weigh on near-term capital spending initiatives while contract lettings in key states have been soft recently. Given these concerns and current multiples, we remain on the sidelines for now and reiterate our Neutral rating.” Vulcan Materials Company closed on Friday at $34.22."
2012-08-13,Fitch Downgrades Martin Marietta Materials' IDR to 'BBB-'; Outlook to Stable ,"Fitch Ratings has downgraded Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.'s (NYSE: MLM) ratings, including the company's Issuer Default Rating (IDR), to 'BBB-' from 'BBB'. Fitch has also removed Martin Marietta's ratings from Rating Watch Negative. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release. Fitch had originally placed the company's ratings on Watch Negative in December 2011 following Martin Marietta's proposed business combination with Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC). On May 14, 2012, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware entered a final order and judgment enjoining Martin Marietta for a period of four months from taking steps to acquire control of VMC's shares or assets. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Chancery decision on May 31, 2012. In accordance with the order, Martin Marietta terminated its exchange offer for VMC shares and proxy solicitation to elect four nominees to the board of directors of VMC. Fitch will likely put the company's ratings back on Watch Negative should Martin Marietta re-initiate its bid for VMC."
2012-08-22,X Factor: 13 Stocks Hit Ex-Dividend Date on August 23,"By Bristol Voss, Minyanville Staff Writer Six stocks will reach their ex-dividend date tomorrow, which is significant for investors since the seller of the stock on that date, not the buyer, receives the most recent dividend. A stock must be bought one day before the ex-dividend date to claim any dividends that have been announced but not yet paid. Dividends are paid on the dividend record date, which is usually two business days after the ex-dividend date. Purchasers must own a stock several days prior to the dividend record date to get the dividend. Those purchasing right before the date forfeit the dividend and normally get the stock for a reduced amount. It may seem like an anachronism in this era of high-frequency trading, but the dividend rate rules are in effect since it can still take up to three business days for transactions to be credited to and settled in an investor’s account. Thirteen stocks claim August 23 as their ex-dividend date and include the company where “naked models underwhelm,” Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), which holds a yearly dividend yield of 1.90%. The largest annual dividend of the group belongs to Deswell Industries (DSWL) with an annual dividend yield of 7.12%. FirstMerit (FMER) has a dividend yield of 3.97%; Atmos Energy (ATO) yields 3.84%; Diebold (DBD) yields 3.37%; Northrup Grumman (NOC) yields 3.16%; and Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) yields 3.01%. Assurant (AIZ) yields 2.43% and Apollo Global Management (APO) has a dividend yield of 2.08%. Further down on the dividend yield scale are HollyFrontier (HFC) with an annual dividend yield of 1.50%, Pan American Silver (PAAS) at 1.18%, Radian Group (RDN) at 0.29%, and Vulcan Materials (VMC) at 0.10%. Purchase -- and have your broker settle -- before the ex-dividend date to secure the dividend.

2013-01-07,"Texas Industries Earnings Preview: Narrower Loss, Revenue Growth Expected","Texas Industries (NYSE: TXI), shares of which are trading near a multi-year high, is scheduled to report its second-quarter fiscal 2013 results Wednesday, January 9, after the markets close. Investors will be looking for improved gross margins on lower costs and another quarter of better-than-expected revenues on improved operating conditions. Expectations Analysts on average predict that Texas Industries will report that revenue grew less than four percent year-over-year to $161.66 million. But a net loss of $0.32 per share is expected. That compares to a net loss of $0.64 per share in the same period of last year. Individual earnings per share (EPS) estimates fall in a range from $0.16 to $0.58. Note that only once in the past six quarters has Texas Industries offered an upside surprise on the consensus EPS estimate. Back in the first quarter, Texas Industries per-share fell short of expectations despite the revenue beat. The company attributed results in part to low levels of construction activity California and Texas. The share price pulled back more than three percent following the earnings release, but quickly resumed its upward trend. For the current quarter, analysts so far expect to see a net loss of $0.48 per share, which would be narrower than in the year-ago period. That consensus estimate has narrowed in the past 60 days from a net loss of $0.52 per share. The consensus forecast also has revenue that is more than four percent higher year-over-year to $ 140.49 million. The Company Texas Industries manufactures and sells cement and other heavy construction materials, primarily in the southwestern United States. It has a market capitalization near $1.5 billion, was founded in 1946 and is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. Melvin Brekhus has been president and chief executive since June 2004. Competitors include Cemex (NYSE: CX) and Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC), both larger by market cap. These rivals are expected to post narrower net losses and marginal revenue growth for their most recent quarters when they report in February. During the three months that ended in November, Standard & Poor's and Sterne Agee both upgraded Texas Industries. The company held its annual meeting of shareholders in October. Performance The long-term EPS growth forecast is about 18 percent, but the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is much higher than the industry average. The company's return on equity is less than two percent. Short interest is almost 20 percent of the float, the highest it has been since July. Only three of the 11 analysts surveyed by Thomson/First Call who follow the stock recommend buying shares. The current share price has overrun their mean price target, but the most optimistic price target represents almost 14 percent potential upside. The stock is up more than 97 percent from a year ago, including more than 16 percent in the past week, when it reached a multiyear. The share price is well above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Over the past six months, the stock has outperformed the broader markets, but underperformed Cemex. Its performance has been in line with Vulcan Materials."

2013-09-25,Plum Creek Invests in Natural Resource Assets in Georgia,"Plum Creek Timber Company, (NYSE: PCL) today announced it has entered into an agreement to acquire an interest in approximately 255 million tons of production at four quarries from Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) for $154 million. The quarries are located in the metro Atlanta, Ga., market and will continue to be operated by Vulcan. Beginning in October 2013, Plum Creek will receive royalty payments from the production and sale of the crushed stone from the quarries for approximately 25 years. This transaction is a unique opportunity for Plum Creek to increase our interest in construction material production in the attractive southeastern markets. These quarries are exceptionally well positioned for the recovery in the infrastructure, industrial and housing sectors in and around Atlanta, said Rick Holley, chief executive officer of Plum Creek. We believe we are investing at the right time in the cycle, and the returns and long-term cash flow profile from these assets are compelling. Plum Creek's unique long term approach to construction materials has allowed us to build a portfolio of owned and acquired assets with excellent return characteristics, continued Holley. Over the past several months, institutional investors have expressed interest in investing in similarly positioned construction material assets. We are exploring the potential to pursue strategic partnerships that would allow us to leverage our experience in this area and earn management income, while limiting the total capital investment we make in this area of our business. Plum Creek is among the largest and most geographically diverse private landowners in the nation with approximately 6.3 million acres of timberlands in major timber producing regions of the United States and wood products manufacturing facilities in the Northwest.

But even if the VIP market contract by 15% in 2014, our sensitivity analysis shows that only 6-12% of EBITDA will be at risk.

2014-04-08,Why Vulcan Materials (VMC) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again - Tale of the Tape,"Looking for a stock that might be in a good position to beat earnings at its next report? Consider Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), a firm in the General Building Materials industry, which could be a great candidate for another beat. This company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. In fact, in these reports, VMC has beaten estimates by at least 25% in both cases, suggesting it has a nice short-term history of crushing expectations. Earnings in Focus Two quarters ago, VMC expected to earn 25 cents per share, while it actually produced earnings of 32 cents per share, a beat of 28%. Meanwhile, for the most recent quarter, the company looked to deliver loss of 3 cents per share, when it actually saw earnings of 7 cents per share instead, representing a substantial positive surprise. Thanks in part to this history, recent estimates have been moving higher for Vulcan Materials. In fact, the Earnings ESP for VMC is positive, which is a great sign of a coming beat. After all, the Zacks Earnings ESP compares the most accurate estimate to the broad consensus, looking to find stocks that have seen big revisions as of late, suggesting that analysts have recently become more bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This is the case for VMC, as the firm currently has a Zacks Earnings ESP of 17.7%, so another beat could be around the corner. This is particularly true when you consider that VMC has a great Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which can be a harbinger of outperformance and a signal for a strong earnings profile. And when you add this solid Zacks Rank to a positive Earnings ESP, a positive earnings surprise happens nearly 70% of the time, so it seems pretty likely that VMC could see another beat at its next report, especially if recent trends are any guide.

2014-04-08,Winning Stock Picking Ideas from Last Week's Employment Report - Screen of the Week,"Every week the government and other entities release economic reports that cover all areas of the economy - from retail sales to housing, to international trade to consumer sentiment. In fact, on virtually any given day there could be anywhere from one to a handful of reports. And while the financial media does cover them, they usually focus on headline numbers without doing a deeper dive. This is unfortunate because within these reports often exists money-making details that can quickly be uncovered with just an extra few minutes of reading. For example, in the Employment Situation report, it details what sectors saw the most new jobs or labor force expansion, and which ones contracted. I can remember countless times where that report got me into the right sectors and industries at the right time before anybody else was talking about them. In fact, I still remember getting into housing in early 2012 while everybody else was staying as far away from it as possible. But, after seeing construction jobs continue to rise in report after report after report, I knew the housing market had turned. And that was one of the first alerts to the housing recovery - for those who knew where to look. But the headline number and the obligatory one-or-two-sentence write ups on many news sites missed the best part of the story by not going the extra mile (or paragraph). Well here we are again, with more stock-picking insight, straight from last week's Employment Situation report. Last week it showed that some of the biggest job creation came from these five industries: 1) Professional and Business Services +57,000 (noted areas: computer system design, and architectural and engineering services) 2) Food Services and Drinking Places +30,000 (up 323,000 over last 12 months) 3) Construction +19,000 (up 151,000 over last 12 months) 4) Health Care +19,000 (noted areas: ambulatory health services and home health care) 5) Mining and Logging +7,000 The reason why I like this report for stock picking is because if an industry is hiring lots of new people, that must mean there's lots of new activity to warrant it. And business activity usually means more money and profits for those companies and their stocks. Screening Once these reports point you in the right direction, you can then plug in the appropriate sectors and industries to capitalize on this information and find the best stocks within those groups. This is just one very specific way to do top down analysis. But you can go to any screener (like the one on Zacks.com or the Research Wizard) and locate the sector, then industry of interest. Then you should add in your favorite and most successful stock-picking criteria to drill down to the best ones, such as Zacks Rank 1s or 2s (Strong Buys or Buys); market-beating growth rates; below industry valuations; upward earnings estimate revisions, etc. Here are 5 stocks from some of the industries singled out as the biggest job creators in last week's Employment report: RMBS Rambus (Electronic Comp-Semi / Comp Sys Design) BWLD Buffalo Wild Wings (Food Services and Drinking Places) VMC Vulcan Materials (Construction) CHE Chemed (Health Care) SWC Stillwater Mining (Mining and Logging) Profitable stock ideas can come at any time and any place. But instead of waiting for the next great stock to fall into your lap, you can actively search for them. And by reading a few extra reports and then putting those ideas into a capable screener, you'll soon be amazed at some of the new picks you come up with. And you'll feel pretty smart after finding them too. The Research Wizard is a great place to begin. It's easy to use. Everything is in plain language. And it's very intuitive.

2014-04-09,Will Fastenal (FAST) Turn It Around this Earnings Season? - Analyst Blog,"Fastenal Company (NASDAQ: FAST) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2014 results on Apr 11, before the market opens. Last quarter, Fastenal posted a negative earnings surprise of 2.94%. In fact, the company has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both revenues and earnings for two consecutive quarters. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Consider this Quarter The company has been struggling with the top line for the past few quarters due to lower sales of its fasteners product line caused by end-market slowdown and broader economic uncertainty. Moreover, the construction as well as vending businesses have been soft for the past three quarters. Ironically, overall sales have not improved despite regular growth programs. According to the data released by the company, severe weather conditions hurt sales further in the months of Jan and Feb 2014 — the first two months of the first quarter. Accordingly, we do not expect any significant top-line improvement in this quarter as well. Management has been slowing down store growth in favor of increasing headcount to drive near-term sales growth. However, these initiatives increase employee costs substantially and hurt margins. An unfavorable product mix (due to weakness in fastener products which generate higher margins), pricing and competitive pressures are also hurting gross margins. The accelerated hiring pace is anticipated to continue in 2014 which could further pressure margins. Management, however, expects gross margins to improve in the first quarter of 2014 from a significantly weak fourth-quarter 2013 as headwinds relating to lower trucking utilization and vendor incentives normalize. Earnings Whisper? Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fastenal is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP is 0.00%. Zacks Rank.Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions momentum. Estimates for Fastenal have been declining for the last 60 days. Other Stocks to Consider Here are some other companies for investors to consider, that according to our model have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NASDAQ: BLDR), with Earnings ESP of +100.0% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). KB Home (NYSE: KBH), with Earnings ESP of +4.76% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company's second-half 2013 revenues and profits increased significantly from the first half as improving private construction activity and better weather conditions markedly raised volumes in all segments. Improved volumes favored pricing across most of its markets. Volumes improved 8% in the second half. Additionally, most of the volume and pricing increase was noted in the aggregates segment, which was sluggish in 2012 as well as in the first half of 2013. Strong volume and pricing growth coupled with aggressive cost control also significantly improved earnings and profitability in the second half. In fact, aggregates shipments grew 4% in 2013, a significant improvement from declines of 1% and 3% witnessed in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Encouragingly, 2013 was the first year of aggregates volume growth since 2005. Management expects aggregates demand and volumes to increase in 2014 led by private construction projects. Strong growth potential in Vulcan's served markets and the meaningful operating leverage that exists in the aggregates business are expected to drive earnings growth and cash generation in 2014 as volumes improve. Further, Vulcan's Profit Enhancement Plan implemented over the past two years has increased adjusted EBITDA by $116 million, generated more than $1 billion from the sales of non-strategic assets and future sales production agreements, and reduced total debt approximately $800 million. Also, in Feb 2012, the company committed to generate $500 million in proceeds from the sale of non-strategic assets. However, the company comfortably exceeded the goal by generating over $1 billion including the transaction with Argos. In Mar 2014, the company sold its cement and concrete businesses in the Florida area to Cementos Argos for $720 million. In addition, the company strengthened the core aggregates business through the acquisition of reserves and quarries in California, Georgia, Texas and Virginia. However, though growing demand in the private construction market is boosting aggregates volumes, the company has limited visibility on growth in aggregates demand in public construction, including highways and other infrastructure projects. Further, the current two-year federal highway bill expires at the end of Sep 2014, creating uncertainty around funding for highway construction. This could hurt aggregates volume in the public sector and prove to be a drag on the company's growth prospects. Other Stocks to Consider Other building stocks worth considering include United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI), Gibraltar Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ: ROCK) and William Lyon Homes (NYSE: WLH). While William Lyon enjoys the same rank as Vulcan Materials, United Rentals and Gibraltar Industries carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2014-04-17,Should You Get Rid of Apogee Enterprises (APOG) Now? - Tale of the Tape,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio. One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Apogee Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOG), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in APOG. A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen 1 estimate moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revision. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from $1.70 a share a month ago to its current level of $1.45. Also, for the current quarter, Apogee has seen 1 downward estimate revisions versus no revision in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 23 cents a share from 32 cents over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 10.0% in the past month. So it may not be a good decision to keep this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don't have a long time horizon to wait. If you are still interested in the Construction sector, you may instead consider some better-ranked stocks including MasTec, Inc. (NYSE: MTZ), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) and Pernix Group Inc (PRXG). All these stocks hold a Zacks Rank #1 (Buy) and may be better selections at this time.

2014-04-23,Homebuilding Stocks: Has Spring Sprung? - Industry Outlook,"The housing slowdown that began in the second half of 2013 was aggravated by a harsh winter. This took a toll on the homebuilders in the December quarter, delaying construction and raising serious doubts as to the strength of the housing market. The weather has no doubt been a major spoilsport for the sector in the past quarter. However, there are other pressing issues for the builders as well. Shortage of lots and skilled labor, rising cost of materials and a declining level of new homes in inventory are not making things easier for these builders. Moreover, the recent spike in mortgage rates and rising home prices are hurting demand. As a result, many companies saw declining order trends in the last reported quarter. Orders declined around 18% at PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM), 6% at Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE: TOL) and 4% at Ryland Group, Inc. (NYSE: RYL) in the last reported quarter. Though order trends improved year over year for others like Lennar Corp. (NYSE: LEN), it slowed down from the past quarter. A slew of data released recently clearly shows that the housing sector has had it tough in the recent past. Homebuilder confidence, as indicated by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo housing market index, dropped to 47 in both April and March and 46 in February from 56 in January indicating increasing builder concerns about meeting ongoing and future demand thanks to a shortage of lots and labor. Further, housing starts declined 0.2% to an annualized rate of 907,000 in February from the prior month, weighed down by lower multi-family starts. Meanwhile, single-family homes and apartments rose only slightly. The February data was a continuation of the January trend when starts dropped 16%. New home sales also dipped 3.3% in February as the weather remained bitter and supply constraints continued to plague homebuilders. However, as the winter chill subsides and builders prepare for the upcoming spring selling season, improving trends may well be in the cards. Builders are increasing their inventories of homes as they anticipate a relatively strong spring buying season. This might propel homebuilder stocks higher in the months ahead as demand for new homes rise. Although interest rates are rising, they are currently doing so below historical levels; housing is still affordable. In addition, accelerating job growth, an improving economy and unlocking pent-up demand will likely boost demand for new homes for the rest of the year. Building permits, a measure of future construction, rose 7.7% in February, the highest rate since October last year and, more importantly, the second highest rate since the middle of 2009. The strong permits show that we can expect steady gains in construction activities over the spring and summer months. NAHB also expects 2014 to be a strong year for housing, expecting a big increase in single-family construction. OPPORTUNITIES Land as Native Strength Homebuilders like Lennar and Toll Brothers with a solid land position have been able to better capitalize on the rising demand for homes during the upturn. This gave these companies a competitive edge over peers like Pulte which faced land availability constraints. During the downturn, Lennar strategically focused on acquiring new home sites in well-positioned markets. The company thus has enough land in all major markets to satisfy deliveries well into 2015. However, others like Pulte have intentionally slowed down the sales pace across some of their communities (thus lowering the community count) due to a lack of land development and scarcity of finished lots. Housing inventory, both existing and new homes, remains tight in most markets. Instead, Pulte has been more focused on driving price and margin in most communities. This strategy hurt net order growth significantly, with orders declining around 10% in fiscal 2013 -- a stark contrast to the increase enjoyed by most of its peers. California-based homebuilder KB Home (NYSE: KBH) is also emphasizing on price and margin improvement to optimize returns from its land assets. This slowed down its sales pace and resulted in lower order growth in 2013. Though the price optimization initiatives of Pulte and KB Home have boosted profits in the past, the companies need to increase their volumes consistently to boost long-term top-line growth. Other homebuilders have realized the importance of land investments. Ryland Group has spent $689 million on land acquisition and $257 million on site development in 2013. Texas-based D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE: DHI) invested $2.6 billion in land, lots and development in 2013, positioning it well to meet demand for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. KB Home spent $1.14 billion in land investment in fiscal 2013, significantly more than $564.9 million spent in 2012. In fact, aggressive land investments helped KB Home record better order trends in its last reported quarter, Q1 of fiscal 2014. High-End Homes Driving Prices Despite the softness in the market, pricing remained strong in the back half of the year. Home prices began moving up sharply from 2013 with market demand gaining momentum and supply remaining limited. Many homebuilders like Lennar, KB Home and Toll Brothers have shifted their focus on high-end communities, primarily in California, Arizona, Colorado and Florida, which allow them to sell larger, higher-priced homes, driving the ASPs up. Homebuilders like KB Home also target the higher income, move-up buyers who are more likely to qualify for home loans. Pulte is shifting its focus towards its high-priced Pulte-branded, move-up homes, which improve the overall ASP. Also, Pulte is building some new commonly-managed communities that represent homes that have been constructed under the company's more efficient design, cost and build processes and thus generate better margins and volumes than the non-commonly-managed communities. Another small homebuilder, Meritage Homes Corporation (NYSE: MTH), is also seeing improving selling prices from a mix shift towards move-up homes in higher priced communities and states. Luxury home-builder Toll Brothers is focused on improving the quality and the luxury quotient of its homes, thus giving it a competitive advantage. Margins Remain Strong Despite slowing volumes in the second half, pricing remained strong, which along with tight cost control and improved efficiencies boosted the overall margins for many homebuilders. Most housing companies are striving to improve their operating and financial performance through strategic restructuring initiatives. The initiatives taken include workforce reductions, improving overhead leverage, managing inventory tightly and implementing new pricing strategies. The homebuilders expect these cost reduction and operating efficiency improvement plans combined with positive housing demand to continue to boost profitability in 2014. Ancillary Companies Seeing Strong Momentum Construction material companies Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) and Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE: EXP), and building product makers Masco Corp. (NYSE: MAS) and Louisiana-Pacific Corp. (NYSE: LPX), have gained momentum from improving new home demand. These companies also saw a concomitant rise in demand and volume for their products. In fact, Vulcan Materials' second-half revenues and profits improved significantly from the first half as improving private construction activity and better weather conditions markedly raised volumes. Positive trends in new home construction activity and improvement in repair/remodel activity in North America significantly improved Masco's top line in the second half of 2013. Fed to Keep Interest Rates Low For most of 2013, the Federal Reserve bought $85 billion in government bonds and mortgage backed securities a month, known as quantitative easing, to keep interest rates low and boost economic growth. However, the Fed scaled back the bond buying program thrice by $10 billion each as economic growth picked up. At present, the Fed is buying $55 billion in bonds per month. Ideally, tapering of the bond-buying plan would have put pressure on interest/mortgage rates. However, the Fed has maintained tight control on interest rates and they have been kept low, irrespective of the reduction in the bond buying program. This has removed a major overhang for homebuilders. WEAKNESSES Supply Constraints A shortage of approved home sites, labor constraints in some markets and a lack of available capital for smaller builders are lowering the supply of homes, both new and existing. The supply of homes is still not meeting current demand leave alone pent-up demand. If the supply picture does not improve, home prices could shoot up further, causing many homebuyers to hold back on their purchase decisions. Rising Interest Rates Since the middle of 2012, homebuilders have largely benefited from historically low interest rates, eventually leading to the sharp increase in home buying activity. However, mortgage/interest rates are edging upwards to more normalized levels since May 2013. According to the Freddie Mac mortgage survey, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has risen from 3.59% on May 23 to 4.34% as of Apr 10. High interest rates dilute demand for new homes, as mortgage loans become expensive. This lowers a buyer's purchasing power. This can hurt volumes, revenues and profits at the homebuilders. Homebuilders at large admitted that higher interest rates have eaten into volumes since the second half of 2013. But the homebuilders are also convinced that sluggish demand is only a fleeting phenomenon and buyers would soon return to the market overcoming their inhibitions of rising rates and climbing home prices. As discussed above, the Fed has also assured of a stable interest rate. In fact, while interest rates are an important part of the home buying business, sustainable increases in housing and housing demand for the long term will require the overall economy to strengthen. This means further job growth, improving household incomes, rising consumer confidence and easing of credit availability. The economy, while still improving slowly, is far from a full-fledged recovery. Until there is a more robust economic recovery, new home sales would continue to lag historical levels. Interestingly, with the rise in mortgage rates, lenders are beginning to ease credit standards to more normalized levels, which could in fact have a modest positive impact on demand. Rising Input Costs Rising input costs are a concern due to increasing costs of building material and labor. As housing starts accelerate, both labor and construction material costs would continue to experience upward pricing pressure, impeding future margins. Latest Performance of Key Players Despite rising interest rates and harsh weather, important housing companies like D.R. Horton and Pulte beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both revenue and earnings in the December quarter. This was largely due to aggressive pricing and margin growth, which made up for slowing order growth. However, New Jersey based Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: HOV) missed expectations on both counts due to delays in deliveries caused by severe weather, interruption of cabinet supply and construction labor shortages. Others like Toll Brothers beat earnings expectations on the back of strong margins, while missing out on the revenue consensus due to soft order growth and difficult year-ago comparisons. Among those which have already reported their results for the March quarter, Lennar and KB Home beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both revenue and earnings helped by better order trends, price increases and strong gross margins. Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification, we rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank. As a guideline, the outlook for industries in the top 1/3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and the bottom 1/3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of #177 and higher is 'Negative.' The Zacks Industry Rank for the construction industry is currently at #141. This is in the middle 1/3rd of all industries ranked, highlighting the group's near-term neutral outlook. The cautious stance reflects an albeit temporary pause after a harsh winter and the threat of rising interest rates before demand picks up in the upcoming spring selling season. Earnings Trends Looking at the overall results of the Construction sector, earnings shot up 13.9% in the December quarter, due mostly to pricing gains and strong margins -- a major decline from a 32.1% rise in the September quarter due to slower volumes. Total revenues were up 6.3% in the quarter versus a 9.2% rise a quarter ago. The sector racked up an earnings beat ratio (the percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) of 63.6% and revenue beat ratio of 72.7% in the December quarter. In the first quarter, earnings and revenues are expected to grow 2.5% and 4.9%, respectively, with better growth rates expected in quarters thereafter as the sector regains momentum. For 2014, earnings are expected to show a 12.3% increase. Revenues are forecast to expand 8.1%. For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our latest ‘Earnings Trends.' Bottom Line Though the harsh winter and rising home prices did put the brakes on a housing recovery last quarter, homebuilders are increasingly optimistic of improving demand in the upcoming spring selling season. Many homebuilders noticed that both traffic and sales volume showed a steady improvement in January and February as they left the seasonally slowest months behind them. Our proprietary Zacks Ranks indicate the movement of stocks over the short term (1 to 3 months). At present, 16% of the stocks sport a bullish outlook while 62% are neutral.

Though the price optimization initiatives of Pulte and KB Home have boosted profits in the past, the companies need to increase their volumes consistently to boost long-term top-line growth. Other homebuilders have realized the importance of land investments. Ryland Group has spent $689 million on land acquisition and $257 million on site development in 2013. Texas-based D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE: DHI) invested $2.6 billion in land, lots and development in 2013, positioning it well to meet demand for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. KB Home spent $1.14 billion in land investment in fiscal 2013, significantly more than $564.9 million spent in 2012.

The initiatives taken include workforce reductions, improving overhead leverage, managing inventory tightly and implementing new pricing strategies. The homebuilders expect these cost reduction and operating efficiency improvement plans combined with positive housing demand to continue to boost profitability in 2014. Ancillary Companies Seeing Strong Momentum Construction material companies Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) and Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE: EXP), and building product makers Masco Corp. (NYSE: MAS) and Louisiana-Pacific Corp. (NYSE: LPX), have gained momentum from improving new home demand. These companies also saw a concomitant rise in demand and volume for their products. In fact, Vulcan Materials' second-half revenues and profits improved significantly from the first half as improving private construction activity and better weather conditions markedly raised volumes. Positive trends in new home construction activity and improvement in repair/remodel activity in North America significantly improved Masco's top line in the second half of 2013.

2014-05-05,Can Vulcan Materials (VMC) Keep the Earnings Streak Alive? - Analyst Blog,"We expect Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2014 results on May 6. Last quarter, the company delivered an astounding positive earnings surprise of 333.33%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Vulcan Materials is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. Positive Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, stands at +5.88%. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. Zacks Rank: Vulcan Materials carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) which, when combined with +5.88% ESP, makes us confident about a positive earnings beat. Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. The Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement. What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings? The construction aggregates producer's second-half 2013 revenues and profits increased significantly from the first half as improving private construction activity and better weather conditions markedly raised volumes in all its segments. Volumes improved 8% in the second half. Additionally, most of the volume and pricing increase was noted in the aggregates segment, which was sluggish in 2012 as well as in the first half of 2013. Strong volume and pricing growth coupled with aggressive cost control also significantly improved earnings and profitability in the second half. Management expects aggregates demand and volumes to increase in 2014 led by private construction projects, though uncertainty exists in public construction market. Strong growth potential in Vulcan's served markets (Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas) and the meaningful operating leverage that exists in the aggregates business are expected to drive earnings growth and cash generation in 2014 as volumes improve. Moreover, margins are expected to improve further in 2014 driven by volume and pricing growth as well as solid cost control and operating efficiencies from the profit enhancement initiatives. Other Stocks to Consider Other stocks in building/construction sector that have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are: Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (NYSE: MLM), with Earnings ESP of +4.00% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Texas Industries Inc. (NYSE: TXI), with Earnings ESP of +7.14% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). D.R. Horton, Inc.

Operating income was $9.1 million, up 33.9% year over year. Operating margin in the quarter remained flat at 3% Segmental Performance Revenues from the Energy and Mining segment grew 69% year over year to $183.9 million. The segment's operating income went up 40.8% year over year to $7.7 million primarily driven by contribution from Brinderson. In addition, profits from the Wasit gas field project in Saudi Arabia also added to growth. The Water and Wastewater segment's revenues increased 2.3% to $106 million from $103.8 million in the prior-year quarter. The segment's operating income rose 17.8% year over year to $3 million. The growth was driven by increased volumes in North American operations. Revenues in the Commercial and Structural segment increased 20% year over year to $16.2 million. The segment reported an operating loss of $1.6 million versus an operating loss of $1.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Backlog Consolidated backlog in the first quarter went up 56% year over year to $748.7 million (including Brinderson backlog of $255.8 million).

Cash flow from operations has also reaffirmed to be between $100 and $110 million. The company confirmed return on invested capital in the range of 7–8%. The company expects that the corrosion engineering and cathodic protection as well as the robotic coatings business will grow on the back of continues progress on the offshore Saudi Aramco Wasit project, which is expected to be completed in late 2014 or early 2015. Further, Brinderson is actively bidding several large upstream opportunities in the coming months which will drive growth. On the flip side, the international mining markets and the oil and gas market in Mexico remain challenging for the industrial linings business, which is factored into the outlook for 2014. Over the past few months, there has been renewed interest from existing mining customers in several markets. In addition, the coatings operation in Louisiana continues to actively pursue a significant addressable market for the Gulf of Mexico offshore market which will aid long term growth.

2014-05-06,"Vulcan Materials Q1 Loss Narrows, Revs Beat Ests - Analyst Blog","Vulcan Materials Company's (NYSE: VMC) first-quarter 2014 adjusted loss of 28 cents per share was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 34 cents per share. The adjusted loss excludes one-time items such as earnings related to the sale of the Florida-area cement and concrete assets in March and interest expense related to debt purchased in the same month. First-quarter 2014 adjusted loss was also narrower than the prior-year quarter loss of 47 cents per share. Total revenue of $574.2 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $536 million by 7.1%. Total revenue increased 6.7% from the prior-year quarter owing to pricing gains and volume growth in aggregate segments. Total revenue in the first quarter comprised $548.5 million of net sales (up 8.7% year over year) and $25.9 million of delivery revenues. Gross profit grew 93% to $34.1 million in the quarter due to solid volume growth and operating leverage in the Aggregates segment. Adjusted EBITDA (excluding gain on sale of real estate) was $39 million, up 50% from the prior-year quarter driven by a strong top line and solid cost control. Segment Details Aggregates Revenues rose 10.9% year over year to $360.8 million (including inter-segment sales) in the quarter owing to both pricing and volume improvement. Despite chilly winters, aggregates shipments (volumes) rose 6.0% year over year in the quarter, while average sales price increased 2.0% due to improvement in demand in most markets. Most of the shipment increase was reported in California, Florida, Texas, Georgia and Illinois. Gross profit improved 55.2% in the quarter to $38.5 million due to better leverage on higher volumes and pricing. Non-Aggregates Revenues in the Concrete segment were $96.0 million in the first quarter of 2014, down 3.9% year over year, due to volume decline of 6.4%. Gross loss narrowed from $10.1 million in the first quarter of 2013 to $9.2 million in the first quarter of 2014 due to volume growth and pricing gains. Revenues in the Asphalt Mix segment were $83 million in the reported quarter, down 23.2% year over year, due to 1.3% pricing decline. However, volumes increased 16.7% in the quarter. Gross profit improved 147% to $4.7 million in the quarter due to higher volumes. Revenues in the Cement segment were $8.6 million (including inter-segment sales), down 28.3% year over year due to a 30.6% decline in volume, which offset the increase in pricing during the quarter. In the quarter, the segment posted a gross profit of $0.13 million, lower than $1.01 million in the year-ago quarter due to decreased volumes. Financial Update The company reported cash and cash equivalents of $268.8 million as of Mar 31, 2014 compared with $198.2 million as of Dec 31, 2013. 2014 Outlook Aggregates: Aggregates demand is expected to grow in 2014.

2014-05-06,Will Priceline.com (PCLN) Disappoint this Earnings? - Analyst Blog,"Priceline.com Inc. (NASDAQ: PCLN) is set to report first-quarter 2014 results on May 8. Last quarter, the company posted 5.0% positive surprise. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Growth Factors this Past Quarter Priceline's fourth-quarter earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 42 cents or 5.5%, driven by strong growth in the online travel industry. Revenues of $1.54 billion were down sequentially but up on a year-over-year basis, attributable to share gains in both domestic and international markets. Also, overall bookings were up 38.8% year over year, reflecting improving demand environment. Margins were, however, affected in the quarter due to lower volumes. For the first quarter, Priceline expects revenues to increase 15–25% year over year, and pro-forma earnings per share within $6.35–$6.85. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $6.26. Earnings Whispers? Our proven model does not conclusively show that Priceline.com will beat earnings this quarter.

2014-05-06,Will American Public (APEI) Disappoint This Earnings Season? - Analyst Blog,"American Public Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: APEI) is set to report first-quarter 2014 results on May 8. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 5.56%. Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Factors to Consider this Quarter American Public's fourth-quarter 2013 results were disappointing with both earnings and revenues declining year over year. The poor results were mostly due to worse-than-expected decline in total enrollment and new student enrollment levels. Enrollments in the fourth quarter were affected by decline in enrollments of students using Department of Defense Tuition Assistance or TA benefits. The temporary suspension of the TA due to the government shutdown in Oct 2013 and lowering of the benefits by the military greatly hurt enrollments of military students. Management expects military enrollment hurdles to continue in the first quarter of 2014. New enrollments by students using TA benefits are expected to decline once again in the to-be-reported quarter due to ongoing budgetary constraints and uncertainty. Accordingly, total enrollments are expected to decline in the range of 5% to 7% while student starts are expected to go down in the range of 7% to 9%. American Public expects revenues to remain in the range of flat to an increase of 3% while first-quarter 2014 earnings are projected to be between 43 cents and 48 cents — a significant decline from the prior-year level. Management also expects new student enrollments at Hondros College (acquired in Nov 2013) to increase 45% in first-quarter 2014. Earnings Whispers? Our proven model does not conclusively show that American Public is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1, 2 or 3 for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.

2014-05-06,Fastenal Sales Soften in April - Analyst Blog,"Fastenal Company's (NASDAQ: FAST) April sales slowed versus March due to change in Easter timing. Nevertheless, sales were significantly better than last year indicating that the industrial and construction supplies wholesale distributor's top line is turning around. April net sales rose 10% year over year to $315.1 million. Daily sales for the month grew 10.0% to $14.3 million, much better than April last year. However, daily sales in April were lower than 11.6% growth in March. Currency was a 0.5% headwind in the month. Fastenal serves customers in the manufacturing and non-residential construction markets. Daily sales to manufacturing customers (representing almost 50% of revenues) grew 8.5%, slightly better than 5.6% last year but down from 11.4% in Mar 2014. Daily sales to non-residential construction customers (representing 20% to 25% of revenues) grew 5.4%, better than 0.8 % in April last year. However, it was slower than 7.6% growth in March. After struggling for the past many quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in the first quarter of 2014. Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, up from 4.9% in the prior-year quarter, owing to increase in sales volume. Though the company witnessed softer sales in January and February due to harsh weather, sales improved in March. The double-digit growth in daily sales in March was driven by favorable timing of Easter and increased investments in stores that led to improvement in sales. The Easter holiday proved to be a headwind in April versus a benefit in March. Management also seems optimistic for top-line and incremental margin growth in future quarters as underlying markets improve, vending re-vamps, sales improvement efforts expand and comparisons remain easy throughout 2014.

2014-05-08,Is Fastenal Turning Around?  - Analyst Blog,"On May 6, 2014, we issued an updated research report on Fastenal Company (NASDAQ: FAST). After struggling for the past many quarters, Fastenal's top line turned around in the first quarter of 2014, results of which were announced on Apr 11. Both earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings of 38 cents per share grew almost 3% while sales went up 8.7% year over year. Fastenal's total average daily sales growth rate in the first quarter was 8.7%, up from 4.9% in the prior-year quarter, owing to increase in sales volume. Though the company witnessed softer sales in January and February due to harsh weather, sales improved in March. The double-digit growth in daily sales in March was driven by favorable timing of Easter and increased investments in stores that led to improvement in sales. Moreover, despite being slower than March, Fastenal's April sales were nevertheless significantly better than last year. The Easter holiday proved to be a headwind in April versus a benefit in March. Management also seems optimistic for top-line and incremental margin growth in future quarters as underlying markets improve, vending re-vamps, sales improvement efforts expand and comparisons remain easy throughout 2014. However, though sales improved in the first quarter, the company has struggled with the top line for several quarters due to lower sales of its fastener product line. The fastener business continues to be soft due to end-market weakness, especially heavy equipment manufacturers. Though the first-quarter top-line rebound is encouraging, a sustained top-line improvement is required to raise investors' confidence in the stock. Moreover, an unfavorable product mix (due to weakness in fastener products which generate higher margins), pricing and competitive pressures are hurting gross margins despite gradual top-line improvement. Further, management has been slowing down store growth in favor of increasing headcount to drive near-term sales growth. However, such initiatives increase employee costs and hurt margins. The accelerated hiring pace is anticipated to continue in 2014 which could further pressure margins. Fastenal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the building products/ construction/materials sector include Vulcan Materials Co. (NYSE: VMC), United Rentals Inc. (NYSE: URI) and Aegion Corp. (NASDAQ: AEGN).

2014-05-15,The Most Overvalued S&P 500 Stock Is...?,"The winner, by more than a country mile, is... Amazon! (NASDAQ: AMZN). The online retailing colossus sports the highest price-to-earnings ratio among stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index: a whopping 462 times its trailing 12-month earnings. Amazon's P/E ratio, based on Wednesday's closing price of $297.62, down 2.3 percent on the day, is 25 times the overall P/E ratio of stocks in the S&P 500, which was 17.9 last Friday. For most, Amazon's P/E, based on trailing 12-months' earnings, suggests a stock that's wildly overvalued and primed to fall. It already has suffered a big pullback, falling nearly 27 percent since its intraday peak of $408.06 reached on Jan. 22. The question is whether there's more damage ahead for the stock. Related: The 5 Most Overvalued Dow Stocks Following Amazon on the list of enormous P/E ratios were Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC), Consol Energy (NYSE: CNX), and online video merchant Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). All had P/E ratios above 100. Overvalued Market? The huge size of those P/E ratios feed into the belief of many that the stock market is overvalued (some would say grossly overvalued) and ready to tumble after more than five years of gains. Wednesday stocks did slide lower, with the Dow Jones industrials down 101 points to 16,614. The point loss was its largest since a 130-point loss on May 6. The S&P 500 fell 9 points to 1,889 with only 131 stocks in the index showing gains. The decline did little to change which stocks are overvalued in a conventional sense, with Amazon remaining the leader. Amazon, of course, plays by its own rules, ignoring demands to boost profits. Instead, it concentrates on cutting prices while expanding services, all in hopes of maximizing revenue. And so its P/E ratio expanded dramatically, soaring past 600 in the first quarter alone. The big rally since March 2009 has pushed prices sharply higher; the S&P 500 is up about 180 percent in that time. Lately, however, the P/E ratios have pulled back. The S&P 500's 17.9 P/E ratio on Friday was down from 19 a year ago. The 12-month forward P/E ratio is 15.8.

2014-05-15,Amazon.Com Is The Most Overvalued S&P 500 Stock,"And the winner, by more than a country mile, is Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN). The online retailing colossus sports the highest price-to-earnings ratio among stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index: a whopping 462 times its trailing 12-month earnings. Amazon's P/E ratio, based on Wednesday's closing price of $297.62, down 2.3% on the day, is 25 times the overall P/E ratio of stocks in the S&P 500, which was 17.9 last Friday. For most, Amazon's P/E, based on trailing 12-months' earnings, suggests a stock that's wildly overvalued and primed to fall. It already has suffered a big pullback, falling nearly 27% since its intraday peak of $408.06 reached on Jan. 22. The question is whether there's more damage ahead for the stock. Amazon was followed by Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC), Consol Energy (NYSE: CNX), and online video merchant Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX). All had P/E ratios above 100. The huge size of those P/E ratios feed into the belief of many that the stock market is overvalued (some would say grossly overvalued) and ready to tumble after more than five years of gains. It happens that Wednesday did see stocks slide lower, with the Dow Jones industrials down 101 points to 16,614. The point loss was its largest since a 130-point loss on May 6. The S&P 500, the object of our inquiry, fell 9 points to 1,889 with only 131 stocks in the index showing gains.

2014-07-15,"Vulcan Materials Hires New CEO, Hikes Dividend Again ","The board of directors at Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) recently announced the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer (NYSE: CEO). Also, the largest producer of construction aggregates in the U.S. announced a quarterly dividend on Friday — the second increase this year. On Monday, Vulcan Materials announced the appointment of J. Thomas Hill, 55, as President and CEO of the company. Hill, who served as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Vulcan Materials, replaces Donald James, 65. Last week, the company announced that it will pay a quarterly dividend of 6 cents per share in Sep 2014, versus 5 cents paid in May. The quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual dividend of 24 cents per share, yielding 0.4% annually. The increased quarterly dividend will be payable on Sep 10, 2014, to shareholders of record as on Aug 27. Earlier in February, Vulcan Materials increased the quarterly dividend by 400% from 1 cent to 5 cents. We believe Vulcan Materials' improved liquidity position following the sale of non-core cement and concrete businesses in Florida, reduction in debt and improved earnings from the Profit Enhancement Plan are responsible for the back-to-back dividend increases. Under the Profit Enhancement Plan, Vulcan Materials divested non-core assets, improved earnings and cash flows, paid off debts and thereby strengthened its overall credit profile. With the sale of non-core cement and concrete businesses in Florida to Cementos Argo for $720 million in March, the company achieved the goals laid down under the plan. These initiatives implemented over the past two years have increased adjusted EBITDA by $116 million, generated more than $1 billion from the sale of non-strategic assets and future sales production agreements and reduced total debt of approximately $800 million. Other Stocks to Consider Vulcan Materials carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Other stocks in the building construction/materials sector worth considering include Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (NYSE: MLM), D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE: DHI) and Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE: TOL). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

2014-08-05,"Vulcan Materials Q2 Earnings in Line, Revenues Beat  ","Vulcan Materials Company's (NYSE: VMC) second-quarter 2014 adjusted earnings (including cost acquisition and divestiture activity) of 37 cents per share were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings increased 184.6% year over year. Vulcan Materials Company - Earnings Surprise | FindTheBest Total revenue of $791.1 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $731 million by 8.2%. Total revenue increased 7% from the prior-year quarter owing to strong performance of Aggregate and Asphalt Mix. Total revenue in the second quarter comprised $756.3 million of net sales (up 8.7% year over year) and $34.9 million of delivery revenues. Volume markedly improved in the second half of 2013 from the first half, driven by improved product demand owing to broad-based recovery in private construction activity, especially residential and better weather conditions than the first half. Difficult weather conditions had delayed shipments in the first quarter of 2014, slowing down volume trends slightly. However, in the second quarter of 2014, the company benefited from an increase in construction activity, which resulted in higher demand for Vulcan products. Gross profit surged 31.5% to $174.8 million in the quarter due to solid volume growth and operating leverage in the Aggregates segment. Adjusted EBITDA was $173 million, up 23% from the prior-year quarter driven by a strong top line and solid cost control. Segment Details Aggregates Revenues rose 19% year over year to $552.5 million (including inter-segment sales) in the quarter owing to both pricing and volume improvement. Aggregates shipments (volumes) rose 10.0% year over year in the quarter driven by growing demand for construction. Average sales price increased 3% due to improved demand in most markets. Shipments continued to increase more than 15% in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Illinois and Texas. However, shipments rose 11% and 12% in key markets of Florida and South Carolina, respectively. Unfavorable weather had hampered shipment in the prior quarter. However, with improvement in weather and demand, shipments increased as well. Gross profit improved 27% in the quarter to $162 million due to favorable operating leverage, higher pricing and cost control. Non-Aggregates Revenues in the Concrete segment were $93.8 million in the second quarter of 2014, down 22% year over year, due to a 22.9% volume decline. Gross profit of $3 million improved from a loss of $6 million in the year-ago quarter due to pricing gains. Revenues in the Asphalt Mix segment were $107.8 million in the reported quarter, up 7.9% year over year as volume increase made up for the pricing decline. While pricing declined 1.8%, volumes increased 3% in the quarter. Gross profit remained flat at $9 million in the quarter due to higher volumes. Revenues in the Cement segment were $2.2 million, down 81.5% year over year. The Cement business, excluding the calcium product business, was sold in the first quarter of 2014 along with Florida concrete assets. In the quarter, the segment posted a gross profit of $0.8 million, which was better than the year-ago quarter performance. 2014 Outlook Aggregates: Private construction is expected to continue to lead volume growth in 2014. In fact, the company expects full year 2014 aggregates shipments to increase in the range range of 7% to 9%, much higher than the prior expected range of 4% to 7% increase. Aggregates prices are still expected to increase 3–5%. The company expects segment margins to improve further in 2014 driven by volume and pricing growth as well as solid cost control and operating efficiencies from the profit enhancement initiatives. Non-Aggregates: In the non-aggregates segments, the company continues to expect to earn $40 to $60 million in gross profit in 2014, compared to $14 million in 2013. Volume and price are expected to improve in concrete and asphalt segments, driven mostly by increased private construction activity. Vulcan Materials carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2015-03-12,Could Summit Materials Put The IPO Market Back On The Road?,"The First Leveraged Buyout Of 2015 Hits The Public Markets Amid a quiet IPO market in the first quarter of 2015, attention this week shifts to Blackstone-backed construction materials company Summit Materials (NYSE: SUM). As the old cliché goes timing is everything, and with the construction business on the rebound, now may be the perfect time for the conglomerate. The company, based in Denver, CO, went public this Thursday. The stock opened at $20.16 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares have since risen slightly higher, and are up more than 12 percent on the day. Summit Materials, formed by Blackstone in 2009, is a group of building material assets. Its strategy is to acquire and grow building companies in the aggregates, ready-mix concretes, cement, asphalt paving, and construction industries. It has since acquired 34 companies and consolidated the group into 11 companies within its portfolio. Related Link: Don't Miss What Lumber Liquidators Said This Morning Summit established itself as a top 10 U.S. supplier of aggregates by volume in the residential, commercial, and public construction markets. With the housing market rebounding, building materials like stone and gravel present an opportunity for investment. A recent February 2015 Barron's article featured competitor Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC). The article mentioned the improvement in the housing market and the company saw a rise in demand as the company experienced a 15 percent jump year over year in 4th quarter shipments. High Growth Comes with High Costs As one of the fastest growing construction materials companies in the country, revenue increased 197 percent since December 2010 to December 2014 compared with average revenue increase of 38 percent from competitors. Summit's revenue in the last 12 months was $1.2 billion versus December 2013 revenue of $916 million. A contributor to Summit's revenue growth is the company's aggressive acquisition strategy, with deals being funded through equity commitments and debt financing. These buys have added to the company's debt of $1.06 billion. The company has still yet to make a profit. Net income as of December 2014 was a net loss $6.28 million which is a major improvement compared to previous net losses of $104 million in December 2013. EBITDA margin is 13 percent and poised to continue upward with the rebound in the construction market. Summit employs 4,500 people across the nation, doing business in 17 states with a major focus on Texas, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Utah. The company effectively utilizes vertical integration to supply its customers with heavy-side construction materials and related products. Private Equity Backing Summit was initially started with the backing of private equity and investment firms The Blackstone Group and Silverhawk Capital Partners. Blackstone will still own up to 75 percent majority of the company and closely linked to the firm's interest. The typical private equity route is to hold the firm's assets until it can exit out at a profit. Investors should look for signs when the company begins selling off its stakes -- most likely when Summit starts consistently turning a profit. It could be sooner than later with data from the National Association of Home Builders noting housing starts are estimated to grow by 57 percent between 2013 and 2016. At the same time, nonresidential private construction is expected to rise by 26 percent. With public infrastructure aging, Summit feels they can support its business long-term. The firm's large presence should be a contributing factor in its ability to win business in future profitable projects. Competitors such as Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE: MLM) and Vulcan Materials Company (mentioned above) have performed well lately. Advanced Draining System which was the most recent construction supply company IPO traded up 74 percent since its July 2014 debut. Conclusion and Pricing Info The company appears to have a strong growth strategy that serves major markets on the rebound with an experienced management team. If current trends continue, it could further boost profits and expand its market share going forward. The debt level is a little worrisome. Summit plans to use of the proceeds to pay down debt, but if the company raises around $400 million, there will still be plenty of debt left. Investors should monitor the company over the coming quarters. As always, investors should consider their risks and objectives before making any decision to purchase an IPO. The offering included underwriters Citigroup, Goldman, Sachs, & Co., BofA Merrill Lynch, and Barclays.

2015-08-17,3 Stocks D.A. Davidson Analysts Just Upgraded,"Brent Thielman and JB Groh of D.A. Davidson were busy on Monday with three separate research reports in which shares of Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), Summit Materials Inc (NYSE: SUM) and KLX Inc (NASDAQ: KLXI) were all upgraded. Vulcan Materials: Solid Fundamentals Brent Thielman upgraded shares of Vulcan Materials to Neutral from Underperform with a price target raised to $106 from a previous $90 as a cautious stance no longer applies following the company's second-quarter print. According to Thielman, Vulcan's second-quarter report (and recent developments in the global market) demonstrates it has momentum in heavy-side materials industry pricing which is further supported by improving trends in domestic construction activity. As such, market momentum is shifting increasingly in Vulcan's favor. Thielman also noted that a focus on local markets (as opposed to global markets that come with increased risk) further enhances the company's appeal with investors. However, Thielman's new price target reflects an 8x multiple on the company's EBITDA target of around $2 billion at normal demand levels. The analyst noted that the multiple is below the stock's long-term average as the timing (if at all) of demand normalization remains elusive. Summit Materials: Improved Outlook Thielman also upgraded shares of Summit Materials to Buy from Neutral with a price target raised to $32 from a previous $28 following the company's mixed second-quarter print that was driven by unusually disruptive weather. Thielman noted the company earned $0.32 per share in the quarter (exclusive of debt financing costs) which was better than the $0.24 he estimated. EBITDA (before various adjustments) of $69.7 million was short of the $76.0 million expected but the company boosted its full-year EBITDA guidance to a range of $265-$290 million (from $235-$255 million) as the company is a domestic-focused supplier to local markets and now has meaningful influence over pricing for key commodities in its portfolio. Thielman also added that Summit's M&A strategy continues to support significant gains despite adverse weather in several key locations. At the same time, overall organic growth rose 3 percent (although more moderate versus prior quarters) while the company saw impressive organic pricing improvements across all categories. Bottom line, Summit's momentum should be appealing to investors within the escalating volatility commodity market. KLX: Trading At A Discount Versus Peers JB Groh upgraded shares of KLX to Buy from Neutral with an unchanged $48 price target as the stock's current price implies a value of the Aerospace Solutions Group (ASG) business at approximately 7.5x EBITDA (which is a 30 percent discount to its closet peer) and ascribes no value to the Energy Service Group (ESG) segment. Groh said that the while the ESG segment only contributes 20 percent of total revenue, the market has been placing too much emphasis on a small portion of the company. The analyst added that while the segment will likely continue generating operating losses this is already factored into the stock. In fact, the company can use its cash flow generation from other businesses to complete deals over the next two years at a time when industry multiples are depressed. On the other hand, ASG is expected to continue seeing mid-single digit growth given strong commercial aircraft deliveries and a rebound in the aftermarket as planes delivered during 2009 to 2011 approach major maintenance intervals. Bottom line, the company has ample liquidity with $429 million cash, a $750 million revolver (with no maturity until 2022) and a $250 million stock repurchase authorization that could be used to support the stock in the short term."

2015-09-15,The 'Great Debate' Happening In Construction Right Now,"U.S. construction activity is still in the middle innings of its cycle, according to Ted Grace of Susquehanna. Investor concerns around the segment are misplaced. Shares of United Rentals, Inc. (NYSE: URI), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) and Summit Materials Inc (NYSE: SUM) remain positive rated. In a report published Monday, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Ted Grace noted that three-plus years into the housing/construction recovery, the segment continues to see solid cyclical growth within the $360 billion private, non-residential construction market and the broader $1 trillion U.S. total construction sector. Construction Momentum Continuing Grace continued by highlighting several data points to support his view of continued momentum in construction. Specifically, the analyst pointed out the acceleration of non-seasonally adjusted growth over the past few months and the breadth of improvement across key sub-verticals (e.g., lodging, power, manufacturing, amusement and recreation). Related Link: Building Something With This Construction ETF In fact, Grace estimated that 2015 real private non-residential construction will have rebounded by 25 percent off its 2011 trough with total construction up 15 percent over the same period. However, non-residential construction will remain approximately 30 percent below its 2008 peak, even as the U.S. economy has grown approximately 20 percent since then. Most importantly, however, based on a variety of metrics, we believe the current cycle has legs beyond the horizon of our bottomsup [sic.] forecast (that extends only to 2016), Grace wrote. In a cyclical world where the 'macro' most often trumps the 'micro', we view this as favorable for Positive-rated United Rentals, Vulcan Materials, Martin Marietta Materials and Summit Materials. Per Capita Forecast Finally, Grace pointed out that he is forecasting a per capita spending of $1,130, which exceeds both the 10- and 20-year average of $1,200 and $1,300, respectively. Nevertheless, this also falls 33 percent below the 2008 peak per capital consumption of $1,710. Looking Ahead Bottom line, the analyst concluded that his non-residential construction forecasts are suggestive of nothing more aggressive than mid-cycle and well below any semblance of peak.

2016-03-16,Bank Of America: Steel Dynamics A Better Bet Than U.S. Steel,"In a recent industry overview, Bank of America Merrill Lynch looked into the U.S. steel industry against the backdrop of the U.S. Commerce Department's preliminary dumping tariff decision. The document outlined tariffs on HRC imports (hot rolled coil imports) prohibitive as follows: Australia: 23 percent Brazil: 34 percent Japan: 6–11 percent Korea: 4–7 percent Turkey: 5–7 percent The UK: 49 percent Bank of America considers anything below 10 percent less prohibitive, depending on the U.S. price premium to other countries. What It Means While the final decision is not slated until August 3, the tariff decisions have been in the works since August 2015. In regards to what the tariff means and what the decisions imply, Bank of America explained, As a result of the expected tariff decision, imports slowed into year-end 2015. Related Link: Credit Suisse Bullish On Steel Sector These declines in addition to mill curtailments and seasonal demand have contributed to a tighter market. Import volumes already fell on the back of the investigations, yet we would expect some further net declines as Brazil and Australian imports fall, even as Turkish and Japanese tons perhaps rise, said Bank of America. For the near term, Bank of America anticipates relative strength, but questions its sustainability. We recently got more conviction on sheet price upward momentum after channel checks this week suggested markets have gotten tighter, the firm said. While rising prices can invite more imports and capacity to restart, we see a delay before any incremental tons can affect the market. Through May U.S. domestic prices may continue to rise, after which upward momentum could be challenged by seasonally slower demand, restarts, and or/higher imports. A Few Names The industry note highlighted Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) specifically, indicating a 12-month price objective of $23 per share and justified given the greater cash flow outlook ahead, more diversified geographic/end market mix, and potential Columbus deal-related synergies. Bank of America currently has a Buy rating on Steel Dynamics. Other Buy-rated names in the space include: Kaiser Aluminum Corp. (NASDAQ: KALU) Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

2016-03-28,"Goldman On Industrials: Continues To Prefer Construction Products Over E&C, Machinery","Goldman Sachs raised its coverage view on Engineering & Construction (E&C) to Neutral from Cautious as non-OPEC supply reductions provide visibility on an oil price recovery through 2017 and risk of E&C multiple expansion. Moreover, Goldman continues to prefer Construction Products (Attractive) to E&C (now Neutral) and Machinery (Cautious). Our Cautious view on E&C was based on an extended capital allocation shift for commodity producing companies and countries from infrastructure investment to balance sheet repair, analysts, including Jerry Revich, wrote in a note. Goldman said since lowering its E&C view in late 2014, energy capex estimates have been reduced by 46 percent, mining capex by 38 percent and consensus EPS by 26 percent. Related Link: A Muddled Outlook For Industrial ETFs Now, based on non-OPEC supply reductions, the brokerage estimates an oil price recovery to $57 in 2017 that could drive multiple expansion for the group. The analysts expect the capex recovery to be concentrated in U.S. shale – where E&Cs have limited exposure ex-LNG. On Machinery, Goldman sees an emerging construction recovery in Europe, China and U.S. (public). According to the note, Our Buys are focused on product cycle opportunities (Trimble Navigation Limited (NASDAQ: TRMB), WABCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE: WBC)), rising cash returns (Allison Transmission Holdings Inc (NYSE:ALSN), PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ: PCAR)), and European truck exposure (Paccar, Wabco). However, for mining & construction machinery, the analysts believe excess global mine and U.S. pipeline supply will make earnings growth in 2017 challenging, underpinning their Cautious view and Sell ratings on Joy Global Inc. (NYSE: JOY) and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT). Meanwhile, Goldman reiterated its Attractive coverage view on Construction Products, and expects first quarter earnings to reveal accelerating aggregates pricing momentum due to the carryover effect of mid to late 2015 pricing actions, and rising visibility on the public construction cycle. In addition, a structurally repriced markets following a sustained M&A cycle will also benefit the sector. Our top picks remain Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM), Summit Materials Inc (NYSE: SUM), analysts added."
2016-04-25,Goldman Upgrades Machinery Sector From Cautious To Neutral,"A recovery in Chinese construction demand has led Goldman Sachs to upgrade Joy Global Inc. (NYSE: JOY) and Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) to Neutral from Sell, while upgrading the broad machinery sector to Neutral from Cautious. Joy Analyst Jerry Revich is concerned about Joy's exposure to high-cost mining regions longer-term, but sees potential for a capex recovery if the Chinese construction recovery continues. We estimate 70 percent upside to new equipment capex if spot commodity prices are sustained, Revich concluded. The analyst raised his 2017–18 EPS estimates to $0.34/$0.38 from $-0.37/$-0.50, driven primarily by higher new equipment sales forecasts. Related Link: Jefferies Looking For Green Shoots In Machinery Stocks: What That Means We estimate $1.50 as mid-cycle EPS. Our estimate is based on new equipment sales of $1.2 billion – equivalent to 2014 levels and 100 percent above 2016E sales; and aftermarket sales of $2.0 billion – in-line with 2017E and 36 percent below 2012 peak, Revich said. The analyst, who raised Joy's price target to $24 from $13, noted stabilization in total mining capex budgets could be enough to drive normalization in equipment demand. However, long term, Revich continues to see market share risk for North American coal and iron ore due to significantly higher ore grades – and as a result lower costs – in Australia and South America. According to the analyst, Joy derives 16 percent of sales from Australia compared to Australia's over 40 percent share of seaborne iron ore and met coal markets. Caterpillar On Caterpillar, Revich said a sustained China construction recovery has increased iron ore spot 20 percent higher since February, and could contribute to a recovery in machinery share of mining capex. Our Sell rating on CAT was based on our view of an extended downturn in US pipeline, global mining, and construction capex for commodity export countries. We cited improved commodity supply-demand balance and a weakening US$ as key risks to our call, which have played out as we did not anticipate a sustained China construction recovery, Revich noted. The analyst, who expects mid-cycle resources sales of $7.1 billion compared to $5.9 billion in 2016E, said, Incremental sales could come at 40 percent incremental margins. Revich raised his price target on the stock to $78 from $62. However, he remains concerned about the gas compression capex cycle and still expects the pace of U.S. pipeline capacity additions to slow, with a 45 percent decline in growth capex in 2017 compared to 2015 levels. We see a $300 million headwind in 2017 vs. 2016 EBIT, net of the impact of CAT's service business, Revich noted. Related Link: Caterpillar CEO: We're Near Bottom Broad Analysis On the sector, the analyst sees potential for mining equipment share of capex to return to historical average, implying a doubling in new equipment sales off 2016 levels. Revich also highlighted that the construction machinery demand in commodity export countries could improve if the current commodity recovery is sustained. While capex/FCF is above the historical average, we note that if spot prices hold, earnings power for the major global miners would improve by 80 percent – a scenario that would take capital allocation toward capex to historical lows. That said, the analyst is not positive on the sector due to oversupply of Machinery in many regions of the world with pockets of pricing pressure. A Few Favorites Revich's top picks in the sector include Trimble Navigation Limited (NASDAQ: TRMB), WABCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE: WBC), Allison Transmission Holdings Inc (NYSE: ALSN) and PACCAR Inc (NASDAQ: PCAR). In addition, Goldman still prefers construction productsover machinery and E&C, with Buy ratings on Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) and Summit Materials Inc (NYSE: SUM). Shares of Caterpillar fell 2.36 percent to $76.48, and Joy Global dropped 2.09 percent to $20.14."
2016-06-15,Bank Of America Calls Steel Prices 'As Good As It Gets',"Bank of America has raised its steel price forecast but sees no remaining upside for now. The firm has upped its U.S. benchmark hot rolled coil (HRC) 2016 average price estimate from $485 to $530/short ton. Analyst Timna Tanners is calling for HRC prices to peak at $600/t in Q3 before pulling back in Q4. “Sheet market strength has been driven by supply constraints, as trade cases and higher Q1 Asian prices reduced import offers and AKS and X have each kept blast furnaces idle,” Tanners explained.

2016-08-03,Vulcan Materials Shares Punished Following Earnings; Argus Says Selloff Was Overdone,"Argus said the recent selloff in Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) shares following its lower-than-expected Q@ earnings was overdone. The firm maintained its Buy rating on the stock with a target price of $129. Vulcan reported adjusted earnings of $0.90 per share, up from $0.65 a year earlier. However, adjusted EPS missed the consensus forecast of $1.01 due to wet weather and project delays. In our view, Vulcan remains one of the best-positioned companies in the industry thanks to its size and scale, and significant presence in states such as Florida, California, and Texas, where demand for basic road and building products remains strong, analyst David Coleman wrote in a note. Vulcan expects overall demand growth of 7 percent in 2016, driven by private and public construction. It reaffirmed its adjusted 2016 EBITDA forecast of $1-$1.1 billion, and again guided toward the high end of that range. In 2015, EBITDA totaled $836 million. Though the analyst cut his 2016 EPS estimate to reflect the weaker-than-expected quarterly results, the revised numbers came in above the Street view. Coleman lowered his 2016 EPS estimate to $3.46 from $3.69, but remains above the consensus forecast of $3.42. Our above-consensus EPS estimates for 2016 reflect prospects for strong aggregates shipments and increased demand from residential construction and new highway and infrastructure projects, Coleman added. At time of writing, shares of Vulcan Materials recouped some of its earlier losses and were up 1.69 percent to $118.53. Coleman's target of $129 implies a potential total return, including the dividend, of 12 percent from current levels."

These companies make aggregates that are needed for highways and their stocks are performing poorly, so he would be very careful when it comes to the thesis of the Government investments in infrastructure."
2016-11-11,Pro: 3 Stocks Could Benefit From Trump's Infrastructure Plan,"Kathryn Thompson is the CEO of Thompson Research Group, an equity research firm that specializes in building materials, building products, construction and other related sectors. She was a guest on CNBC's Power Lunch to discuss which stocks could benefit from President-Elect Donald Trump's proposed infrastructure plan. She was quick to point out whether the infrastructure plan calls for building roads, rail or waterways, the same stocks will likely benefit. Specifically, the expert highlighted Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM), Summit Materials Inc (NYSE: SUM) and Headwaters Inc (NYSE: HW). Thompson said the US is on the brink of the largest infrastructure plan since the end of World War 2 and is driven by 1) The FAST Act. 2) States and local communities are tired of waiting around for the federal government for infrastructure support. 3) President-Elect Trump's proposed infrastructure project which could amount to $1 trillion over 10 years. Thompson added that while Trump's $1 trillion plan over 10 years sounds like a large sum, in reality it's not that far removed from President Obama's stimulus plan which initially called for $800 billion in spending over a five to six-year time period."

2016-12-05,"Another Election, Another Rapid Boom In Infrastructure","This article originally appeared on MotifInvesting.com. Stop us if you’ve read this before: “With President-elect… pledging to rebuild the economy from the inside out, infrastructure companies stand to reap a substantial bonanza.” Investors may remember reading this from a 2008 CNBC report, when President-elect Barack Obama pushed a $787 billion stimulus measure to rebuild the nation’s near-shattered economy, beginning with its crumbling roads and bridges. The Obama plan was good for a short-term boost among construction and engineering stocks in the wake of his election. Equities such as Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), a heavy equipment manufacturer, and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC), a producer of construction materials such as sand, gravel and concrete, soared as much as 20 percent between Obama’s victory in November 2008 and January 2009, before coming back to earth once actual legislation had been signed. And while many infrastructure stocks are enjoying a nice rally now, it’s important for investors to note that not all of the optimism surrounding a potential infrastructure plan put forward by President-elect Donald Trump has been priced into construction, engineering and materials securities. Analysts and reporters are still digging into what is very much a large moving target. But it’s a very large moving target, which makes it so appealing to investors. There’s no shortage of projects for the industry to tackle. The American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that it would take at least $3.6 trillion by 2020 to fully repair the nation’s infrastructure. That figure doesn’t even take into account Trump’s $8 billion to $12 billion plan to completely seal off the U.S.-Mexico border with “a great, great wall on our southern border.” Cooperation between Congress and the White House trumps a great plan While all presidents promise big plans, the Republican Party’s victory in the election – holding the senate and earning the White House – adds urgency and a sense of political possibility in achieving Trump’s infrastructure vision, which is goosing what are generally pretty stable equity prices. “We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none,” Trump said after his surprise election victory over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.” Although plans are sketchy, the Republican vowed during the campaign that he would double the $275 billion in infrastructure spending proposed by Clinton. By comparison, less than half of Obama’s stimulus package was spent on physical infrastructure; most of the legislation was directed at tax breaks and benefit extensions. If Trump is able to deliver on his promise, his administration would be responsible for one of the largest public-works improvement programs in a century, rivaled only in scope by the projects spawned during the Great Depression. Infrastructure-related stocks are on the move Although several Wall Street fixtures had predicted carnage on Wall Street if Trump won the White House, the Republican victory immediately boosted several construction and engineering stocks. Caterpillar closed up almost 8 percent on the day after the election with stock closing above $91 per share. Vulcan gained about 10 percent, closing at $131.55. Investors who held stock in Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR), the Irving, Texas-based construction and engineering giant, gained more than 10 percent on the day after the election. Construction materials stocks did well, too. Martin Marietta Materials (MLM), a leading supplier of construction materials for roads and sidewalks, saw its stock rise more than 11 percent to close above $225 per share in the wake of the election. US Concrete Inc (NASDAQ: USCR), already a partner in the $4 billion rebuilding of New York City’s dilapidated LaGuardia Airport, climbed almost 11 percent to close above $54. And while stock in Cemex SAB de CV (ADR) (NYSE: CX) has remained more or less flat, the Mexican company has been named as a possible provider of concrete for Trump’s proposed border wall. “As ludicrous as The Trump Wall project sounds (to us at least), it represents a huge opportunity for those companies involved in its construction,” analysts wrote in a July research report for Alliance Bernstein (AB), a New York-based asset management firm. “If The Wall does go ahead, it will almost certainly be built from concrete. What is less clear at this stage is whether U.S. or Mexico-based suppliers will benefit.” An anticipated boost in infrastructure spending also has helped investors holding equities in basic materials used in big projects, such as copper and steel. United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X), which has been upgraded in the wake of the election by several investment banks, soared 17 percent on the day after the vote, closing at $24.56. Its stock is currently trading above $29, a whopping 40 percent above its Election Day price. Talk is cheap Some of the euphoria surrounding infrastructure-related stocks has been tempered since the election. Experienced investors recall that most gains from infrastructure stocks vanished completely between the time Obama was elected in November 2008 and when he signed the stimulus bill three months later. There’s also no small degree of concern about Trump’s plans to use tax credits to pay for a massive infrastructure upgrade. While some projects such as sewage plants and toll roads may generate revenue that attracts investors, most public works aren’t expected to produce a continuing income stream. The Trump plan also is likely to require cooperation from the Republican-controlled Congress. Trump’s plan depends upon the willingness of companies to repatriate earnings that are kept in overseas accounts to avoid higher U.S. taxes. The earnings would be taxed at 10 percent when they’re brought back to the U.S.; Trump’s plan would offer a credit for investment in infrastructure projects, offsetting the repatriation tax. “The real need is straight-up funding, not additional financing tools,” Bud Wright, director of the Washington, D.C.-based American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, told the Wall Street Journal. “These are sort of formulaic numbers that you could come up with to present something that looks like a plan.”"
2017-01-25,Trump's Border Wall: A Look At The Numbers,"There are plenty of things for Americans who disapprove of President Donald Trump to criticize. So far, inaction is not one of them. In his first week in office, Trump has already taken measures to follow up on several key campaign promises. On Wednesday, he is expected meet with the Department of Homeland Security to discuss the logistics of building a concrete wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. Discussion of the border wall typically triggered some of the loudest cheers during Trump’s stump speeches throughout the campaign season. Critics have blasted Trump’s border wall plan as economically infeasible, but Trump has insisted that Mexico will pay for the construction of the wall. The Cost Statista recently put together the graphic below outlining the economics of the proposed wall. The latest version of Trump’s vision includes a 1,000-mile-long, 40-foot-high wall that will stretch more than half the total length of the U.S./Mexico border. The border wall will require an estimated $711 million of concrete and $240 million of cement. However, those materials costs pale in comparison to the estimated labor costs of building the wall. Trump has said the wall would cost an estimated $10 billion–12 billion, but Bernstein Research pegs the actual number in the $15 billion–25 billion range. Shares of materials stocks, particularly those in the concrete segment, are up on Wednesday ahead of Trump’s anticipated announcement. Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) is up 1.5 percent, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) is up 2.9 percent, China Advanced Constructn Mtrls Grp Inc (NASDAQ:CADC) is up 4.0 percent and US Concrete Inc (NASDAQ:USCR) is up 3.3 percent. Developing Story Despite no tangible plans for repayment, as explained by Press Sec. Sean Spicer in Wednesday's press briefing, Trump stated in his first one-on-one interview with ABC News that Mexico will absolutely and 100 percent pay for the wall. Update: In a White House breaking news release at 1:37 p.m. EST, Spicer announced Trump's order of construction of the wall.

2017-01-29,Trump's Wall Plans Lift This ETF,"Politicians are no strangers to controversy and many are familiar with campaign trail bluster that ultimately goes unfulfilled. Love him or hate, President Donald Trump is moving forward with his plan to build a wall around the U.S.-Mexico border. So Trump, no stranger to controversy, is at least attempting to make good on one of his campaign trail promises, which is more than can be said of many politicians. A cornerstone of Trump's campaign was stricter immigration policy. In addition to the border wall effort, the new president has also pledged to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities, or those cities opting to stand in violation of federal law in order to harbor illegal immigrants. To be clear, this article is neither condemnation nor endorsement of Trump's immigration policies or the wall effort. It's merely to highlight an investment opportunity that is positively responding to the effort to build the wall. Enter the PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio (NYSE:PKB). The PowerShares Dynamic Building & Construction Portfolio was one of a few dozen exchange traded funds printing all-time highs on Wednesday. Some of the ebullience surrounding PKB is being attributed to strong housing data, but PKB is not a homebuilder ETF on par with a fund such as the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (NYSE:ITB). Rather, the PowerShares offering tracks “companies that are primarily engaged in providing construction and related engineering services for building and remodeling residential properties, commercial or industrial buildings, or working on large-scale infrastructure projects, such as highways, tunnels, bridges, dams, power lines, and airport,” according to PowerShares. Home to 30 stocks, PKB holds names such as Martin Marietta Materials Inc. (NYSE:MLM) and Vulcan Materials Co. (NYSE:VMC), holdings that explain the ETF's leverage to speculation about Trump's wall plans. As Benzinga noted Wednesday, The border wall will require an estimated $711 million of concrete and $240 million of cement. However, those materials costs pale in comparison to the estimated labor costs of building the wall. Trump has said the wall would cost an estimated $10–12 billion, but Bernstein Research pegs the actual number in the $15–25 billion range. However, even if Trump's wall desires are never realized, PKB can still benefit if the new president is able to push through parts of massive $1 trillion infrastructure effort. A glance at PKB's roster indicate the ETF is bound to benefit from that scenario just as it has wall chatter. PKB is up 6.2 percent since the start of 2017 and nearly 39 percent over the past year."
2017-02-13,How Much Could It Cost To Fix Oroville Dam?,"More than 188,000 people have been evacuated from homes and businesses in Northern California after heavy rains damaged the Oroville Dam, the tallest dam in the United States. While residents and officials now place the safety of everyone involved as the top priority, the dam's physical integrity, or lack thereof, also poses a significant financial risk as well. $200 Million A massive hole has formed in the dam’s spillway, and experts estimate repair costs could reach $200 million. The dam also provides irrigation and water supply to 755,000 acres of land and 25 million California residents as well. The Oroville Dam forms Lake Oroville, which holds around 3.5 million acre feet of water. Lake Oroville is the second largest water reservoir in the state of California. Related Link: Trump's Border Wall: A Look At The Numbers Costs Vs. Infrastructure Campaign Promises President Donald Trump has pledged to spend $1 trillion in the next decade on infrastructure projects to improve dams, roads, bridged, airports and other construction projects. One of the largest construction projects Trump wants to begin within months is the construction of a 1,000-mile, 40-foot-high concrete wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. One of the most recent estimates has the border wall cost alone at $21.6 billion, not an insignificant portion of the pledged infrastructure spend. Speculative Repair Companies There has been no indication from federal or local authorities about which companies could be involved in Oroville Dam’s repair, but it will certainly be a major project. In terms of major U.S. construction companies that could be involved in the repair process, Bechtel Corporation is one of the likeliest candidates. Bechtel is the largest privately-held construction company in the United States. Bechtel was one of six companies commissioned by the government back in 1931 to build the Hoover Dam. In addition to Bechtel, the Utah Construction Company was also part of the Hoover Dam project. Utah Construction is now owned by BHP Billiton Limited (ADR) (NYSE:BHP). Of course, the project could also be a major potential contract for concrete suppliers and other materials companies such as US Concrete Inc (NASDAQ:USCR) and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) as well.

2017-02-15,Intelligent Infrastructure Index Emphasizes The Technology Side Of Connected Infrastructure Projects,"Donald Trump’s plan to invest up to $1 trillion in domestic infrastructure projects has U.S. infrastructure investors excited about the potential tailwinds that government projects could provide in the market over the next decade. Traditionally, infrastructure stocks include construction and materials stocks such as Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) and Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM). However, Kensho Indices has put together an infrastructure index that focuses on the technology integration that will be key to the next decade of American infrastructure spending. “The New Economies Intelligent Infrastructure sector captures the full range of developments from smart buildings and road networks to smart grids that use sensors and intelligent meters to manage power lines and optimize power consumption,” Kenso explains on its website. See Also: The Tue Cost Of Fixing's America's Infrastructure The firm has put together the Kensho Intelligent Infrastructure Index (KINFRA), an index of U.S. companies that should play an important role in the new market of intelligent infrastructure. In the past year, the index is up 38.8 percent compared to only a 25.1 percent gain for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and a 16.1 percent gain from the iShares S&P Global Infrastructure Index (NASDAQ:IGF). The IGF ETF, which is one the most heavily-traded infrastructure ETF on the market today, is only about 40 percent allocated to U.S. stocks. KINFRA holdings are more than 75 percent American companies. Top KINFRA holdings include Roper Technologies Inc (NYSE:ROP), ABB Ltd (ADR) (NYSE:ABB) and Toro Co (NYSE:TTC)."

2017-12-14,"Barclays Constructs A Bullish Call On Caterpillar, CNH Industrial And Others","The American machinery and construction industry is likely to see better times ahead, according to Barclays. The firm initiated coverage of the sector with a Positive outlook. Coming off several once-in-a-100-years cycles, the sales bases are the low, the political rhetoric is high and the risk-reward is still skewed positive despite the market run, analyst Adam Seiden said in a note. Seiden initiated coverage of 18 companies with a Positive view. We believe the earnings, the denominator in P/E, will keep valuations attractive within the normalized 10-20x framework, he said. The analyst expects the companies in his coverage universe to grow over the next two to three years, with investors willing to put a higher multiple on that growth. The about-face in investor sentiment toward the machinery space is mostly attributable to Washington and the prospect for tax reform, the analyst said. Looking at macro and micro data pertaining to the industry, Barclays said GDP, PMI and manufacturing demand all have improved, while retail sales at Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT) and Deere & Company (NYSE:DE) have also progressed. Among other metrics, the firm said: Inventories are in-line. Used equipment values in U.S. agricultural and construction sectors are either stable or slowly rising. Units and horsepower are converging. Mining equipment sales are up 80 percent year-over-year in the third quarter. Global infrastructure demand is turning favorable for heavy equipment.

2018-01-23,The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500,"Last week I highlighted the Top 10 Value Stocks In The S&P 500 noting that value will have its day in the sun in 2018. This is not a widely held view considering the Russell 1000 Growth index (IWF) has returned 32.2% over the last year while the Russell 1000 Value index (IWD) has returned only 14.7%. Furthermore, high flying Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) jumped to another all-time high after reporting Q4 numbers on Monday after the bell. Total subscriber growth increased 25.4% YoY which helped send the company's market cap to over $100 billion. The chart below highlights Netflix amazing growth as well as its -$510 million cash burn in Q4 (-$2 billion in fiscal year 2017). Source: Avory & Co. Netflix is a timely reminder of just how much momentum these growth stocks continue to have in this market, no matter what valuation multiple they trade at. And while research suggests owning high quality value stocks significantly outperforms in the long-run, high quality growth stocks (such as Netflix) still have steam. Therefore, I decided to find companies that may be masquerading around as high growth stocks but really are not to be trifled with. In order to find these pricey stocks, I downloaded the list of S&P 500 constituents and then used finbox.io's spreadsheet add-on to find which companies had the following: 1) a P/E multiple that trades above its comparable public companies, and 2) projected 5-year earnings growth that's below its comparable public companies. OR 3) an EBITDA multiple that trades above its comparable public companies, and 4) projected 5-year EBITDA growth that's below its comparable public companies. AND 5) has downside as calculated from finbox.io's fair value > 20%. Here are the 10 most expensive stocks in the S&P 500 that I found. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: ProLogis ProLogis Inc (NYSE:PLD) is a global leader in logistics real estate with a focus on high-barrier, high-growth markets. As of September 30, 2017, the company owned or had investments in properties and development projects expected to total approximately 687 million square feet in 19 countries. Prologis leases modern distribution facilities to a diverse base of approximately 5,200 customers across two major categories: business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment. Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes Duke Realty Corp (NYSE:DRE), DCT Industrial Trust Inc (NYSE:DCT), First Industrial Realty Trust, Inc (NYSE:FR) and EastGroup Properties Inc (NYSE:EGP). The company's LTM EBITDA multiple of 27.1x is above all of its selected comparable public companies: DRE (14.9x), DCT (24.8x), FR (19.8x) and EGP (22.7x). Therefore you would expect the company's future growth to be above its peer group. However, ProLogis' projected 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 4.8% is only above DRE (-3.7%) and below DCT (9.1%), FR (6.4%) and EGP (7.2%). Source: finbox.io Shares of the company are up 21.1% over the last year. The stock last traded at $63.11 as of Monday January 22 and eleven separate valuation analyses imply that there is significant downside relative to its current trading price. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Macerich Macerich Co (NYSE:MAC) is a fully integrated self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust, which focuses on the acquisition, leasing, and management of regional malls throughout the United States. Macerich currently owns 54 million square feet of real estate consisting primarily of interests in 48 regional shopping centers. On a comparable company basis, selected benchmark companies include CBL & Associates Properties, Inc. (NYSE:CBL), Brixmor Property Group Inc (NYSE:BRX), Kimco Realty Corp (NYSE:KIM) and Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT). Higher growth companies typically trade at higher valuation multiples but this does not appear to be the case for Macerich as shown below. The company's projected 5-year net income CAGR of -28.7% is well below its entire peer group: CBL (-14.3%), BRX (18.1%), KIM (-5.1%) and FRT (4.0%). However, Macerich's P/E multiple of 64.7x is above CBL (10.4x), BRX (16.3x), KIM (19.3x) and FRT (30.6x). The company appears to be expensive on a future cash flow basis as well. Source: finbox.io Shares of Macerich are down -4.4% over the last year and finbox.io's fair value estimate of $37.61 per share calculated from seven cash flow models imply -43.0% downside. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Align Technology Align Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:ALGN) manufactures and markets a system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners, and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) digital services. The company was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in San Jose, California. The company's valuation multiples currently look expensive relative to peers: Cooper Companies Inc (NYSE:COO), Dentsply Sirona Corp (NASDAQ:XRAY), AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) and Cutera Inc (NASDAQ:CUTR). Align Technology's LTM EBITDA multiple of 60.1x is above COO (20.8x), XRAY (22.7x), ABBV (16.6x) and CUTR (54.9x). Cutera's multiple is only slightly below Align Technology's but Wall Street analysts project that the former will grow its cash flows by 62.8% annually over the next five years. This is well above Align Technology's forecasted five-year EBITDA CAGR of 25.2%. Source: finbox.io Align Technology's stock currently trades at $267.10 per share as of Monday January 22, up 190.2% over the last year. However, finbox.io's five valuation analyses suggest that shares are now roughly 35% overvalued. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Intuitive Surgical Indtuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) manufactures and markets da Vinci surgical systems, and related instruments and accessories. The company’s da Vinci surgical System translates a surgeon’s natural hand movements, which are performed on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small incisions or ports. The company also manufactures EndoWrist instruments that include scissors, scalpels, and other surgical tools. It markets its products directly and through distributors in the worldwide. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. Analysts covering the stock often compare Intuitive Surgical to a peer group that includes Edwards Lifesciences Corp (NYSE:EW), Hill-Rom, Inc. (NYSE:HRC), Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (NYSE:VAR) and Becton, Dickinson and Co (NYSE:BDX). The company's LTM EBITDA multiple of 39.8x is above all of these comparable public companies: EW (21.7x), HRC (16.4x) and BDX (26.2x). However, notice how the company's projected 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 8.9% is only above HRC (7.7%) and below EW (13.8%), VAR (10.1%) and BDX (20.1%). This implies that the market's valuing Intuitive Surgical at a premium. Source: finbox.io Shares of the company are trading 97.9% higher year over year. But the stock price could end up trading -35.5% lower in 2018 based on Intuitive Surgical's future cash flow projections. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Vulcan Materials Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) produces and sells construction aggregates, asphalt mix, and ready-mixed concrete primarily in the United States. Vulcan Materials was founded in 1909 and is headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. On a comparable company basis, selected benchmark companies include Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM), Summit Materials Inc (NYSE:SUM), Eagle Materials, Inc. (NYSE:EXP) and CRH Plc (ADR) (NYSE:CRH). Analyzing Vulcan Materials' valuation metrics and growth ratios provides further insight into why the stock is expensive. Wall Street analysts project that the company's EBITDA grows at 11.1% over the next five years. This growth rate is only above EXP (10.3%) and below MLM (15.2%), SUM (12.5%) and CRH (12.0%). However, Vulcan Materials' EBITDA multiple trades well above this same peer group implying the stock is quite expensive. Source: finbox.io Vulcan Materials' stock currently trades at $133.00 per share as of Monday January 22, up 4.8% over the last year. On a fundamental basis, the company's stock is trading at a -30.8% premium to finbox.io's intrinsic value estimate. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: Mettler-Toledo Mettler-Toledo Internation Inc. (NYSE:MTD) manufactures and supplies precision instruments and services worldwide.

Mettler-Toledo markets its products through its direct sales force and indirect distribution channels. The company was founded in 1991 and is based in Columbus, Ohio. The company's valuation multiples implied by the market currently trade above comparable companies Waters Corporation (NYSE:WAT), PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE:PKI), Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO). Mettler-Toledo's LTM P/E multiple of 38.2x is above WAT (30.8x), PKI (22.4x), A (34.5x) and TMO (36.9x) while its growth is mediocre at best.

Mattel sells its products directly to consumers via its catalog, website, and proprietary retail stores, as well as directly to retailers and distributors. The company was founded in 1945 and is headquartered in El Segundo, California. Sell-side research analysts often compare the company to a peer group that includes Brunswick Corporation (NYSE:BC), Polaris Industries Inc. (NYSE:PII), Acushnet Holdings Corp (NYSE:GOLF) and Hasbro, Inc. (NaASDAQ:HAS). Notice Mattel's projected EBITDA growth of 0% in the chart below. Analysts expect that the company's EBITDA will reach the same level in 2021 as it did in 2016. However, investors purchasing shares today would pay 18.8x EBITDA for a low growth company. This looks very expensive when compared to Mattel's peers. Source: finbox.io Shares of Mattel are down -44.0% over the last year and finbox.io's fair value estimate of $12.25 per share calculated from seven cash flow models imply -23.9% downside. The average price target from 12 Wall Street analysts of $15.50 per share similarly imply downside. The 10 Most Expensive Stocks In The S&P 500: C.H. Robinson C.H. Robinson Inc (NASDAQ:CHRW) is a third party logistics company providing freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies in various industries worldwide. It has contractual relationships with approximately 107,000 transportation companies.

On a comparable company basis, selected benchmark companies include XPO Logistics Inc (NYSE:XPO), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC) and United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS). Analyzing C.H. Robinson Worldwide,'s valuation metrics and growth ratios offers insight into how shares are highly expensive. Typically, high growth companies trade at a higher multiple of EBITDA. But notice the company's projected 5-year EBITDA CAGR of 1.7% is well below all of its peers while its LTM EBITDA multiple of 17.1x is above this same peer group. C.H. Robinson also looks overvalued on a cash flow basis as well. Source: finbox.io C.H. Robinson's stock currently trades at $95.43 per share as of Monday January 22, up 32.4% over the last year. Finbox.io's nine valuation analyses suggest that shares could decrease -23.5% going forward.

The company’s field solutions include various professional test tools, thermal imaging, and calibration equipment for electrical, industrial, electronic, and calibration applications.

(NYSE:AME). Furthermore, the company's EBITDA is only expected to grow at a quicker rate than Pentair over the next five years.

(NYSE:STZ), Coca-Cola European Partners plc (NYSE:CCE) and PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP). Although Coca-Cola's expected growth is in line with this peer group, the company's P/E multiple of 44.3x is well above DPS (23.8x), STZ.B (23.2x), CCE (22.0x) and PEP (24.8x). Coca-Cola is a quality business but simply looks expensive at current prices.

2018-08-16,3 Bearish Stocks To Trade Over The Next Few Days,"The following four stocks are currently in the midst of uptrends according to VantagePoint, an AI charting platform that uses intermarket analysis and artificial intelligence to predict future price action 1-3 days in advance. A couple of things to know in order to understand the charts below: Each chart is a 3-month chart. Candles represent one day of trading The blue line is a predicted moving average, and the black line is a simple 10-day moving average When the blue line crosses above the black, that's a bullish signal. When the black crosses over the blue, that's bearish For a more detailed look at VantagePoint's charts, click here. Baidu.com Baidu Inc (ADR) (NASDAQ:BIDU) has a clear trend to the downside. The market had a crossover to the downside in late-July when that blue line made the cross below the black line. The neural index also reflected that short-term weakness. Since that bearish crossover, the market is down down 14 percent. Cincinnati Financial Cincinnati Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:CINF) was in the midst of an uptrend, but it looks to have had a bearish crossover last week, as you can see by the blue line crossing below the black. Since that crossover, CINF is mostly flat. This will be one to watch for a potential reversal in the coming days. Vulcan Materials Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) follows the idea of BIDU. This one has been in a bearish trend since June 25, and since then VMC is down over 15 percent. As long as the two lines stay apart, and the neural index shows mostly red, this downtrend will continue. VantagePoint is a content partner of Benzinga. For a free demo, click here. `"

2018-10-13,"Midterms And The Stock Market: Potential Winners, Losers From The Coming Election","There’s no question the upcoming U.S. midterm election is one of the most significant near-term catalysts in the market. Here’s a look at what investors can expect from the Nov. 6 elections and which markets may be on the move. Height’s Take Control of both chambers of Congress is at stake. The most likely outcome is that Democrats will gain control of the House (a 70-percent chance) and Republicans will remain in control of the Senate (85-percent chance), according to Height Capital Markets. In a divided Congress scenario, Height said a number of stocks are positioned to benefit from potential policy changes, including the following: NRG Energy Inc (NYSE:NRG) Southern Co (NYSE:SO) Federal National Mortgage Association (OTC:FNMA) Centene Corp (NYSE:CNC) Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) Canopy Growth Corp (NYSE:CGC) At the same time, Height said a split Congress would also create the possibility of negative policy changes for the following stocks: Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG) Energy Transfer Equity LP Unit (NYSE:ETE) JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) Enova International Inc (NYSE:ENVA) Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) Casey’s General Stores Inc (NASDAQ:CASY) Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) Currency Implications The U.S. dollar has been red-hot in 2018, and experts say it will likely resume its rally if Republicans maintain control of both houses of Congress. Republicans are looking to issue another round of tax cuts, which could provide another stimulus for the U.S. economy and trigger another round of interest rate hikes. A Democratic win, on the other hand, would likely threaten Trump’s trade agenda, potentially weakening the dollar. Democrats have traditionally been more trade friendly — good news for the currencies of our trade partners. Small-Cap Stock Risk Small-cap stocks have underperformed large-cap peers during times of a divided government in Washington, according to Goldman Sachs. Small-caps have historically generated average annual gains of about 9.5 percent during periods of divided U.S. governments compared to 21.8-percent annualized gains during periods in which the same party controls the White House and both houses of Congress. Since Republicans gained control in 2016, the iShares Russell 2000 Index (NYSE:IWN) is up 30.6 percent. Election Cycle Trends Regardless of which party comes out on top in November, the general cyclical stock market trends surrounding midterm elections have historically been good news for investors. According to Deutsche Bank, over the past 80 years, from one month prior to midterm elections to two months following the elections, the S&P 500 has averaged an 8-percent gain. That stretch includes just one net loss of 4 percent in 1978. Unfortunately, analyst Binky Chadra said in the same report that the sample size of 21 midterm elections is extremely small, and there are seasonal trends and other conflating data that may have contributed to the gains.

2018-11-06,Here's What's At Stake For Your Investments In The 2018 Midterms,"Each American voter has Congressional seats, local government positions and ballot propositions to consider Tuesday. For investors looking at the big picture of the midterm elections, Height Capital Markets broke down the key races for investors to watch when the vote tallies start streaming in Tuesday evening. The Races There are 10 key Senate races and 67 key House races that could turn the tide for investors on Tuesday, according to Height's Stephanie Miller. “We continue to put odds at 55% that Democrats win majority of the House and Republicans maintain majority of the Senate in tomorrow's Midterm elections, the outcome viewed as most-likely by investors,” Miller wrote in a post. “We maintain our 30% odds of a next-most likely scenario, that Republicans keep majorities in both chambers, with only 15% chances of a Democratic sweep.” Miller said Democrats should easily gain at least 14 House seats no matter what, but they will need to gain 23 net seats to reach the critical majority. Miller said the best-case scenario for Democrats in the House is a gain of about 33 seats. In the Senate, Miller predicts a net gain of one or two seats for Republicans. Height forecasts Republican Senate wins in North Dakota and Missouri, flipping those two seats from blue to red. In addition, the firm is calling for Nevada’s Senate seat to flip from red to blue. Miller said close races for Democrat-held seats in Indiana, West Virginia and Montana will likely stay blue, while the Republican seat in Mississippi will likely stay red after a November 27 run-off. Miller says the Democratic Senate seat in Florida is too close to call. See Also: Midterms And The Stock Market: Potential Winners, Losers From The Coming Election The Issues The balance of power in Congress is critical for investors due to several key issues that could be in play over the next two years. President Trump is getting little resistance from a Republican Congress to his trade war with China, policy that could derail U.S. earnings growth in 2019. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent starting on Jan. 1, 2019. Trump has also pressured the Federal Reserve to ease off of its interest rate hiking schedule, and Republicans are planning another round of tax cuts if they regain control of Congress. The trade war and rising interest rates have impacted auto stocks, making automobiles more expensive for car buyers and more difficult for them to get auto loans. For health care investors, potential Medicaid expansion and the fate of the Affordable Care Act is up in the air. A Democratic victory could pressure energy stocks as well and bring climate change and environmental regulation back into play in Washington. Many Democrats want to restore Net Neutrality, which could be bad news for tech stocks. The Stocks The good news for investors is that stock prices have historically soared following midterm elections. Since 1946, the S&P 500 has averaged a 30-percent gain from its midterm election year lows to its 52-week high in the year following the election. In a divided Congress scenario, Height said a number of stocks are positioned to benefit from potential policy changes, including the following: NRG Energy Inc (NYSE:NRG) Southern Co (NYSE:SO) Federal National Mortgage Association (OTC:FNMA) Centene Corp (NYSE:CNC) Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) Canopy Growth Corp (NYSE:CGC) At the same time, Height said a split Congress would also create the possibility of negative policy changes for the following stocks: Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG) Energy Transfer Equity LP Unit (NYSE:ETE) JPMorgan Chase & Co.

2018-11-07,What Economists Are Watching Following The Midterm Election,"Democrats didn’t get the blue wave they hoped for Tuesday, but they picked up enough votes to take the majority in the House of Representatives, with Republicans maintaining control of the Senate. A divided Congress wasn’t particularly surprising to analysts, but there were still plenty of stocks moving Wednesday morning as the market digested the election returns. Market Trends A Democratic House could provide some resistance to President Donald Trump’s trade war tariffs on China. U.S. tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods are set to rise to 25 percent starting on Jan. 1. The potential for Democrats to pressure Trump to back down on China is theoretically good news for U.S. companies that rely on Chinese supply and demand. Pharmaceutical companies could be in for a rough few years. There are very few areas of overlap between the Democratic agenda and Trump's, but lower drug prices is seemingly one of them. If the Democrats want to prove they can get results even with limited power, they may choose to offer little protest to Republican defense and infrastructure spending in exchange for the president’s cooperation on a drug price legislation. In addition to a potential crackdown on drug prices, pharmaceutical companies may be uneasy about the momentum in the marijuana legalization movement. Recreational marijuana was legalized in Michigan and medicinal marijuana was legalized in Missouri Tuesday, and the ETF MANAGERS TR/TIERRA XP LATIN AME (NYSE:MJ) gained 2.6 percent. Height’s Take Prior to the election, Height Capital Markets predicted a divided Congress and discussed individual stocks that could be winners and losers from a legislative standpoint. In a divided Congress scenario, Height said a number of stocks are positioned to benefit from potential policy changes: NRG Energy Inc (NYSE:NRG) Southern Co (NYSE:SO) Federal National Mortgage Association (OTC:FNMA) Centene Corp (NYSE:CNC) Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) Canopy Growth Corp (NYSE:CGC) At the same time, Height said a split Congress creates the possibility of negative policy changes for the following stocks: Bunge Ltd (NYSE:BG) JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) Enova International Inc (NYSE:ENVA) Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) Casey’s General Stores Inc (NASDAQ:CASY) Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) Historical Trends The primary election takeaway for most investors can be boiled down to one word, said RSM US LLP chief economist Joseph Brusuelas. “Gridlock — that’s the primary economic and financial implication of the Democrats’ takeover of the U.S. House of Representatives and the Republicans’ retention of power in the Senate,” Brusuelas said Wednesday. “While financial markets tend to favor gridlock, the lack of major policy changes and a White House that continues to press on a deregulation agenda likely portend fierce policy battles that will revolve around the fiscal path of the federal government, trade, environmental policy and health care.” The good news for investors is that history has been kind to the market following midterm elections. Regardless of which party comes out on top in November, the general cyclical stock market trends surrounding midterm elections have historically been good news for investors. Over the past 80 years, from one month prior to midterm elections to two months following the elections, the S&P 500 has averaged an 8-percent gain, according to Deutsche Bank. That stretch includes just one net loss of 4 percent in 1978. Unfortunately, analyst Binky Chadra said in the same report that the sample size of 21 midterm elections is extremely small, and seasonal trends and other conflating data may have contributed to the gains. The post-election market reaction is off to a strong start. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was trading higher by 1.24 percent at $278.58 at the time of publication Wednesday, and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) was nearly 1 percent higher.

2019-10-21,13 Stocks With The Highest EPS Growth Over The Past 5 Years,"There’s an age-old debate on Wall Street between growth investors and value investors. Growth investors often argue that value stocks are stagnant and have limited upside. Value investors argue that growth stocks are overpriced and high risk. But value investors should remember that even the best value stocks had to grow their way into their current EPS. There are plenty of growth stocks out there that generate impressive revenue numbers but have yet to demonstrate the company’s business model can turn a profit. At the same time, there are value stocks out there that trade at an attractive earnings multiple but have flat or lackluster EPS growth. Somewhere in the middle, there are companies with extremely high earnings growth. They may not necessarily be value stocks, but their earnings growth demonstrates they're profitable and on the right long-term track. Sometimes, temporary market conditions or accounting shenanigans can make a company profitable for a single quarter or even a single year. But by looking at long-term trends in EPS growth, investors can get a better sense of which companies are turning on the cash spigot and which ones are simply trying to get an earnings report pop. Highest Earnings Growth Stocks Here are the 13 stocks in the S&P 500 that have generated the most EPS growth over the past five years, according to Finviz. Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), +262.4% EPS growth. UDR, Inc. (NYSE:UDR), 171.3% EPS growth. Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA), 165.3% EPS growth. T-Mobile Us Inc (NASDAQ:TMUS), 130.5% EPS growth. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), 102.0% EPS growth. ABIOMED, Inc. (NASDAQ:ABMD), 99.7% EPS growth. Duke Realty Corp (NYSE:DRE), 91.7% EPS growth. Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) 89.6% EPS growth. Devon Energy Corp (NYSE:DVN), 88.6% EPS growth. Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM), 84.2% EPS growth. Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT), 83.0% EPS growth. AvalonBay Communities Inc (NYSE:AVB), 73.0% EPS growth. Apartment Investment and Management Co (NYSE:AIV), 71.3% EPS growth. Benzinga’s Take The companies mentioned above have certainly put up some impressive long-term EPS growth numbers. However, it’s important to understand that some of these companies may have had little or no earnings five years ago. UDR, No. 2 on the list, still trades at an extremely high forward earnings multiple of 104.4. Do you agree with this take? Email feedback@benzinga.com with your thoughts.

2020-06-16,"Analyst: Vulcan, Martin Marietta Could Be $1T Infrastructure Spending Winners","Infrastructure stocks traded higher this week on reports that the Trump administration is preparing a $1 trillion infrastructure investment stimulus bill. Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners said it’s unlikely the bill will successfully make its way through Congress in an election year, but headlines related to infrastructure spending could still move markets. Infrastructure investment in general has bipartisan support in Washington. However, Tanners said politics will likely make getting a bill passed in 2020 very unlikely. In addition, Tanners said issues such as pandemic-related stimulus, police reform and health care will likely have higher priority than infrastructure investment ahead of the November election. “While the need for infrastructure spending has been a repeated mantra of President Trump’s since his campaign in 2016, no such stimulus has been passed and indeed our contacts suggest any passage would be challenged by partisan politics, despite general support from both sides of the aisle,” Tanners wrote in a note. How To Play It: Despite the fact that Bank of America sees “little chance” Democrats and Republicans will reach an infrastructure compromise this year, Tanners said Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM) and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) are best-positioned to benefit. Tanners also named Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) as the best-positioned steel stock should an infrastructure bill ultimately be passed. Benzinga’s Take: U.S. infrastructure is in desperate need of improvement, but investors shouldn’t expect politicians to put the good of the country ahead of getting reelected. Infrastructure spending will likely be a popular topic of discussion as the 2020 campaigns heat up, but analysts seem to believe it is unlikely Washington will take action this year.

2020-10-16,Unusual Options Activity Insight: Vulcan Materials,"Shares of Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) saw some unusual options activity on Friday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $147.45. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-01-15 Strike Price: $135.00 Volume: 0 Open Interest: 1093 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual’ Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. “Out of the money” contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. “Out of the money” occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are “bullish” when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are “bearish” when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor’s true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2020-10-16,A Look Into Vulcan Materials Price Over Earnings,"Looking into the current session, Vulcan Materials Inc. (NYSE:VMC) shares are trading at $146.52, after a 0.51% increase. Moreover, over the past month, the stock spiked by 11.55%, but in the past year, fell by 0.05%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is undervalued, even if the company is performing up to par in the current session. The stock is currently above from its 52 week low by 123.49%. Assuming that all other factors are held constant, this could present itself as an opportunity for investors trying to diversify their portfolio with Construction Materials stocks, and capitalize on the lower share price observed over the year. The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's earnings per share. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company’s current performance against its past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also shows that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Depending on the particular phase of a business cycle, some industries will perform better than others. Vulcan Materials Inc. has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 53.19 of the Construction Materials industry. Ideally, one might believe that they might perform worse than its peers, but it’s also probable that the stock is undervalued. There are many limitations to price to earnings ratio. It is sometimes difficult to determine the nature of the earnings makeup of a company. Shareholders might not get what they're looking for, from trailing earnings."

2020-12-18,Why Morgan Stanley Likes Martin Marietta Materials,"While fiscal 2021 may be impacted by weakness in the non-residential construction segment and muted Infrastructure spend, Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE:MLM), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) and Summit Materials Inc (NYSE:SUM) are likely to witness robust tailwinds in fiscal 2022 and beyond, according to Morgan Stanley. The Machinery Analyst: Courtney Yakavonis initiated coverage of Martin Marietta Materials with an Overweight rating and a price target of $316. She also initiated coverage of Vulcan Materials and Summit Materials with Equal-Weight ratings and price targets of $150 and $22, respectively. The Machinery Thesis: Although aggregates have among the strongest business models within the machinery segment, they serve a highly cyclical construction end market, Yakavonis said. “While the outlook for Resi construction is bright headed into FY21, we believe the remaining 75-85% of Aggregate companies' Non Resi and Infrastructure related exposure is at risk in the through FY21. Pricing should offset most of these anticipated volume declines, but upside is limited in the short term,” she wrote in a note. The analyst noted that aggregates stocks had underperformed the market, down 1% year to date, and may outperform only after there are “tangible signs of a Non-Resi or Infrastructure recovery.” “We prefer Martin Marietta (MLM) over peers due to its better state-level outlook, stronger pricing power, and potential for a re-rating,” Yakavonis added."

2021-01-20,"Stock Market Winners, Losers From Biden's Finance Nominations","President-elect Joe Biden is in the process of piecing together key members of his administration, and three of his potential appointees were making headlines on Wall Street over the weekend. Hard-Nosed Regulators: First, Biden announced Monday he will nominate former student loan watchdog Rohit Chopra as the new head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Chopra is currently a member of the Federal Trade Commission, where he worked to publicly push student loan companies to treat their borrowers more fairly during the Obama administration. Chopra also famously objected to a $5-billion settlement from Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) following a government probe into privacy missteps, claiming the fine imposed was not large enough. Related Link: Here's How Americans Are Spending Their Stimulus Payments In addition to Chopra’s appointment, Biden will also be nominating Gary Gensler to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. Gensler will be replacing Jay Clayton, who earned a reputation for being soft on Wall Street during his tenure as SEC head. Experts say Gensler will likely take a much more hands-on approach to banks, brokers and other public companies. Gensler enacted a new set of rules for swap trading at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission during his tenure as chairman following the chaos that occurred during the 2008 financial crisis. He also oversaw the prosecution of several major investment banks during a Libor price-fixing scandal. Aggressive Stimulus: Finally, incoming Treasury Secretary and former Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen will urge Congress to “act big” in providing economic stimulus to avoid a prolonged U.S. recession. Yellen pledged her support for Biden’s recently unveiled $1.9-trillion coronavirus relief package as part of her confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. “Neither the President-elect, nor I, propose this relief package without an appreciation for the country’s debt burden. But right now, with interest rates at historic lows, the smartest thing we can do is act big,” Yellen said in a prepared statement. Benzinga’s Take: The general consensus among economists and insiders seems to be that Biden’s regulatory team is bad news for Wall Street. Trump made a point of appointing regulators that took a hands-off approach to oversight, but Biden seems to be going in the opposite direction by selecting regulators with reputations for being aggressive. The nominations of Chopra and Gensler could be bad news for big tech stocks and banks given the two men’s histories of sticking up for consumers and investors. Big tech stocks like Facebook, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) could be in for a tough four years ahead. Big bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) could also be on a short leash. At the same time, Gensler’s appointment could be good news for cryptocurrencies and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (OTC:GBTC) given he recently taught MIT courses on blockchain and digital currencies. The market’s positive open on Tuesday also suggests investors care more about Yellen’s bullish stimulus comments than the potential harsh regulatory environment ahead. More stimulus spending in the near-term is good news for bank margins given the yield curve is steepening. Inflation concerns could be good news for the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Infrastructure spending could benefit construction material stocks like Commercial Metals Company (NYSE:CMC) and Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC). And finally, Biden has made his commitment to clean energy very clear, which could create significant tailwinds for funds like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NASDAQ:ICLN).

2021-02-15,A Preview Of Vulcan Materials's Earnings,"On Tuesday, February 16, Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) will report its last quarter's earnings. Here is Benzinga's preview of the company's release. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and especially earnings per share (EPS) are useful measures of a company's profitability. Total earnings, which is also referred to as net income, equals total revenue minus total expenses. EPS equals to net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. Earnings And Revenue Wall Street analysts see Vulcan Materials reporting earnings of $0.98 per share on sales of $1.16 billion. In the same quarter last year, Vulcan Materials reported EPS of $1.08 on revenue of $1.19 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the consensus estimates; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an earnings surprise, which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Tuesday, EPS would have fallen 9.26%. Sales would be down 2.19% on a year-over-year basis. Here is how the company's reported EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 1.62 1.38 0.44 1.17 EPS Actual 1.56 1.60 0.47 1.08 Revenue Estimate 1.37 B 1.29 B 1.01 B 1.19 B Revenue Actual 1.31 B 1.32 B 1.05 B 1.19 B Stock Performance Shares of Vulcan Materials were trading at $159.92 as of February 11. Over the last 52-week period, shares are up 19.92%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably happy going into this earnings release. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. Vulcan Materials is scheduled to hold the call at 11:00:00 ET and can be accessed here."

2021-02-17,Vulcan Materials: Debt Overview,"Over the past three months, shares of Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) rose by 17.00%. Before we understand the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt Vulcan Materials has. Vulcan Materials's Debt According to the Vulcan Materials's most recent financial statement as reported on November 6, 2020, total debt is at $3.29 billion, with $2.78 billion in long-term debt and $509.44 million in current debt. Adjusting for $1.08 billion in cash-equivalents, the company has a net debt of $2.20 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. To understand the degree of financial leverage a company has, shareholders look at the debt ratio. Considering Vulcan Materials's $11.59 billion in total assets, the debt-ratio is at 0.28. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and average for another. Importance Of Debt Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. However, due to interest-payment obligations, cash-flow of a company can be impacted. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-05-03,Vulcan Materials's Earnings: A Preview,"On Tuesday, May 04, Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) will report its last quarter's earnings. Here is Benzinga's preview of the company's release. What Are Earnings, Net Income, And Earnings Per Share? Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue Vulcan Materials earnings will be near $0.45 per share on sales of $1.02 billion, according to analysts. In the same quarter last year, Vulcan Materials announced EPS of $0.47 on revenue of $1.05 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the consensus estimates; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an earnings surprise, which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. The analyst consensus estimate would represent a 4.26% decrease in the company's earnings. Sales would have fallen 2.76% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's reported EPS has compared to analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q4 2021 Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 EPS Estimate 0.98 1.62 1.38 0.44 EPS Actual 1.07 1.56 1.60 0.47 Revenue Estimate 1.16 B 1.37 B 1.29 B 1.01 B Revenue Actual 1.18 B 1.31 B 1.32 B 1.05 B Stock Performance Shares of Vulcan Materials were trading at $178.53 as of April 30.

2021-07-29,'Trading Nation' Traders Share Their Infrastructure Picks,"JC O'Hara of MKM Partners and Gina Sanchez of Chantico Global and Lido Advisors spoke on CNBC's Trading Nation about stocks that could benefit from the infrastructure bill. Sanchez said the bill is broad enough to push higher Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF (BATS:PAVE), but she wants to focus on the materials. She likes broad material ETFs like iShares US Basic Materials ETF (NYSE:IYM). Among the individual names, she would pick BHP Group Ltd (NYSE:BHP), Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF). O'Hara wants to follow the money. He noticed that large portions of cash in this bill are allocated to the power infrastructure and water. He would buy utilities to get exposure to the power infrastructure and American Water Works Company Inc (NYSE:AWK) for the exposure in the water space. O'Hara likes American Water Works because it's breaking out and because of its dividend growth. Its dividend is growing about 10% a year."

Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF (NYSE:BETZ) Launched: June 2020 Assets Under management: $287 million Price: $24.82 52-Week Range: $22.55 to $33.26 Year-to-date: -4% The Roundhill Sports Betting & iGaming ETF offers pure-play exposure to a high growth, well publicized storyline for investors and sports fans. More states are legalizing sports betting and more sports and teams are partnering with betting companies. After a strong 2020, this ETF ended 2021 down on the year. The company counts many international names in the top 10 holdings including Kindred Group, Kambi Group, Flutter Entertainment (OTC:PDYPY) and Entain. Rush Street Interactive (NYSE:RSI), Penn National Gaming (NASDAQ:PENN) and DraftKings Inc (NASDAQ:DKNG) also rank in the top 10 holdings. While there is some risk of sports pausing their seasons or delaying their games, sometimes a schedule change can work out as a positive with more dates for bettors to wager on. The ETF and its holdings should get plenty of headlines in early January, with the NCAA Football Championship Game coming on Jan. 10, 2022. The ETF could also benefit from the NFL’s Super Bowl, which will be played on Feb. 13, 2022. Last year’s Super Bowl set a sports betting handle record and saw heavy customer acquisition promotions by company’s to boost user totals.

The ETF is up 121% over the last three years and has been a strong performer. Top holdings include Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE), Eaton Corp (NYSE:ETN), Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC), Fastenal (NASDAQ:FAST) and Trane Technologies (NYSE:TT). Defiance Digital Revolution ETF (NYSE:NFTZ) Launched: December 2021 Assets Under Management: $10 million Price: $20.18 52-Week Range: $17.90 to $20.32 Year-to-date: N/A The relatively new Digital Revolution ETF from Defiance is likely to get some attention heading into the new year. The pure play ETF holds a basket of stocks of companies that have entered the non-fungible token space or announced plans to enter the sector. The ETF will also hold cryptocurrency mining and cryptocurrency banking related companies. The ETF will rebalance on a quarterly basis. The fund’s initial makeup was broken down as 32.5% NFT stocks, 25.9% cryptocurrency mining stocks, 21.9% cryptocurrency asset management and trading stocks, 15.2% crypto banking, payments and services stocks and 4.6% blockchain technology stocks. Top holdings in the ETF include Plby Group (NASDAQ:PLBY), Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF), Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA) and Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). Until investors have the opportunity to put money into an ETF that holds NFTs directly similar to a DAO, this could be the next best option for pure-play exposure. ProShares Online Retail ETF (NYSE:ONLN) Launched: July 2018 Assets Under Management: $709 million Price: $57.31 52-Week Range: $54.59 to $93.45 Year-to-date: -24.1% January will likely be the time investors and retailers find out exactly how good the holiday shopping quarter was. One trend that hasn’t seemed to go away is the shift to buying and selling items online instead of venturing to physical stores. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated growth for online retailers and showed just how easy and convenient it could be to buy items like groceries online and holiday shopping as well. This ETF counts Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) as its two largest holdings at 26.4% and 10.7%, making the fund a big bet on two top global ecommerce companies. Other top holdings include eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and Sea Ltd (NYSE:SE). While Amazon had a strong 2021, Alibaba shares have been hit hard by concerns over Chinese public companies. The ETF could have several storylines in 2022 with the strength of the 2021 holiday shopping season among the largest. Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSE:META) Launched: June 2021 Assets Under Management: $897 million Price: $15.60 52-Week Range: $13.75 to $17.11 Year-to-date: N/A In half a year, the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF has generated almost $1 billion in assets under management. The ETF is the first pure play ETF with exposure to the growth of the metaverse, a term that has increased in search results and implied long-term valuation. Top holdings of the ETF include NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB), Roblox Corp (NYSE:RBLX), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Unity Software (NYSE:U). As interest in the metaverse continues, the companies that are considered winners of the sector's growth could be in for a strong 2022 and benefit this pure-play ETF."

2022-03-02,36 Stocks To Watch After Biden's First State of The Union Address,"President Joe Biden hosted his first State of the Union Address Tuesday in front of members of Congress. In the speech, Biden discussed several items that he has already helped pass along with more future initiatives. Here is a look at stocks to watch after the State of the Union address. Pharmaceutical Companies: In 2016, then- Vice President Biden launched the Cancer Moonshot program the help boost spending on medical research to take on various types of cancer. In 2022, Biden announced plans to boost spending and reduce the death rate from cancer by 50% over the next 25 years. The Partnership for Accelerating Cancer Therapies includes 11 companies working to boost treatments for various types of cancers. The companies are AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV), Amgen Inc (NASDAQ:AMGN), Boehringer-Ingelheim Pharma, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (NYSE:BMY), Celgene (owned by Bristol-Myers Squibb), Genetech (owned by Roche), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Janssen Research (owned by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ)), Novartis (NYSE:NVS), Sanofi SA (NASDAQ:SNY) and Pfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE). Biden announced his Unity Agenda, which included ending cancer as we know it as one of four bipartisan issues that can be passed. Social Media: Biden took aim at social media platforms and the data collected from children. “It’s time to strengthen privacy protections, ban targeted advertising to children, and demand tech companies stop collecting personal data on our children.” The comment could be aimed at companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR). A push to change data collection and advertising could hurt advertising revenue down the road for the companies. Gun Stocks: Biden used the State of the Union address to address gun control. Biden called on Congress to pass universal background checks, ban assault weapons and repeal a law that protects gun manufacturers from being sued. The comments could be good and bad for gun stocks as any hint of banning weapons could lead to increased sales, while the potential right to sue gun manufacturers could also increase the need for more insurance paid by gun companies and the potential to pay out millions in lawsuit settlements. Gun stocks include Smith & Wesson Brands (NASDAQ:SWBI), Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO) and Sturm, Ruger & Co (NYSE:RGR). Increased gun sales could also boost retailers that sell them, such as American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ:AOUT). Related Link: 5 Things You Might Not Know About Joe Biden Body Cameras: Biden praised the Justice Department for requiring police body cameras. Body camera companies include Axon Enterprise Inc (NASDAQ:AXON) and Motorola Solutions Inc (NYSE:MSI). COVID-19 Tests: Following up on a plan to provide free at-home COVID-19 tests, Biden shared plans for Americans to once again receive free tests from the U.S. government. Companies that make COVID-19 tests include Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Quidel Corp (NASDAQ:QDEL) and Orasure Technologies (NASDAQ:OSUR). Pharmacies: Along with at-home COVID-19 tests, Biden announced the launch of “test to treat,” an initiative that will allow Americans to get tested at a pharmacy. If they test positive they will receive antiviral pills “on the spot at no costs.” This initiative could provide a traffic and sales boost to pharmacy companies that include CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Rite Aid Corp (NYSE:RAD). Pfizer’s Paxlovid, an antiviral oral treatment for COVID-19, was also singled out during the speech. Insulin Costs: Biden said he wants to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month, making it more affordable for consumers. The leading insulin providers are Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO), Sanofi and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). Electric Vehicles: Biden used a portion of the State of the Union to discuss his plan to combat climate change, which includes lowering the price of electric vehicles. Biden shouted out automotive companies Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) and General Motors Corp (NYSE:GM) during his speech. “Ford is investing $11 billion to build electric vehicles — creating 11,000 jobs across the country. General Motors is making the largest investment in its history, $7 billion to build electric vehicles, creating 4,000 jobs in Michigan,” Biden said. The exclusion of Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) from the speech prompted a response from CEO Elon Musk, as Tesla remains the leading producer of electric vehicles in the U.S. Infrastructure: The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law is on the path to fix over 65,000 miles of highway and help “rebuild America.” Biden highlighted the recent announcement that 1,500 bridges will be repaired across the U.S. this year. Companies that could benefit from increased infrastructure spending include Caterpillar Inc (NYSE:CAT), Deere & Co (NYSE:DE), Vulcan Materials Co (NYSE:VMC), United States Steel (NYSE:X), Nucor Corp (NYSE:NUE) and Jacobs Engineering Group Inc (NYSE:J). Intel Shoutout: Semiconductor company Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) got a shout out from Biden during the State of the Union speech. Intel is building two factories in Ohio, as part of the largest economic development in Ohio history. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger was in attendance at the State of Union. Biden praised the plan as a way to help America from supply disruptions from other countries. The president called on Congress to provide billions of dollars in support for domestic semiconductor production for companies like Intel. Mental Health: Another pillar of the “Unity Agenda” was to better mental health care. One pure-play company in the mental health space is Talkspace Inc (NASDAQ:TALK), which provides virtual offerings with licensed mental health providers.

2022-03-21,Ominous Death Cross Forms On Vulcan Materials's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Vulcan Materials, which is trading around $182.35 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at Vulcan Materials's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q4 2021 Q3 2021 Q2 2021 Q1 2021 EPS Estimate 1.16 1.66 1.69 0.45 EPS Actual 1.25 1.54 1.57 0.69 Revenue Estimate 1.55B 1.44B 1.38B 1.02B Revenue Actual 1.61B 1.52B 1.36B 1.07B Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2022-12-06,A Bullish Sign Appears On Vulcan Materials's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be good fortune ahead for shares of Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC). A so-called golden cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bullish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The golden cross occurs when the 50-day crosses above the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Vulcan Materials, which is trading around $179.52 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Golden Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for long positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible long positions.

2023-05-04,This Foreboding Sign Looms Over Vulcan Materials's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with Vulcan Materials, which is trading around $191.24 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at Vulcan Materials's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q4 2022 Q3 2022 Q2 2022 EPS Estimate 1.26 1.70 1.74 EPS Actual 1.08 1.78 1.53 Revenue Estimate 1.84B 2.00B 1.86B Revenue Actual 1.73B 2.09B 1.95B Also consider this overview of Vulcan Materials analyst ratings: Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2023-05-22,Wednesday Is Your Last Chance To Buy Vulcan Materials Before The Dividend Payout,"Wednesday marks the last chance for investors to receive the next dividend payout from Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC). What's Happening The company announced on Friday that it would pay shareholders a quarterly dividend of 43 cents per share. On Thursday, Vulcan Materials will go ex-dividend, meaning the stock will trade lower to reflect that payout. In other words, the stock will likely open 43 cents lower than it would have opened on any other day. In order to be eligible to receive a company's dividend, shareholders must own the stock prior to the ex-dividend date—in this case, Thursday. Shareholders who own VMC as of the end of Wednesday's session are eligible to receive the 43 cents dividend payout for every share that they own. According to the company, this dividend will be paid out to shareholders on June 09, 2023. Investors will then be able to either reinvest those dividends back into the stock or use the payment in some other way.

2023-06-05,"This Dublin Gravel Supplier Is Undervalued Compared To Rivals VMC, MLM: Here's Why","A construction supply company stands to benefit from recent U.S. government initiatives. What Happened: According to Street Sheet, traders would be wise to consider CRH plc (LON: CRH), which currently touts a $35.4 billion market cap. The Dublin-based company will likely see an uptick in demand for its products, which are used to make concrete, cement, and asphalt. Why? Because some $2 trillion in spending will pour into the economy due to three pieces of legislation: The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2021. The Inflation Reduction Act, enacted by President Joe Biden last August. The Chips Act, which provides tax credits and subsidies for domestic U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. See Also: Dow Drops Over 100 Points, Crude Oil Rises CRH is an undervalued stock to watch, Street Sheet explained, citing the growing need for building supplies as new battery plants and chip facilities get built. The stock gained 23% during the past 12 months, but it currently trades at 11x the estimated 2024 earnings, whereas its competitors — Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) and Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) — trade at 22x and 25x forward earnings, respectively. Why It Matters: CRH, which stands for Cement Roadstone Holdings, is in the process of moving its primary stock market listing to the U.S. This will help CRH establish stateside recognition and close the valuation gaps it has with its rivals. Reporting rules in the U.S. will also make it easier to compare CRH to its two American competitors: MLM and VMC. That could, in turn, drive the stock higher. Meanwhile, commercial construction activity in the U.S. was up 19% in March year-over-year, and road construction is up 20%. More of the same, if not better, can be in the cards for soon-to-be US-listed CRH, Street Sheet predicts.

Why Short Interest Matters Short interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises. Short interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.

2023-08-08,Price Over Earnings Overview: Vulcan Materials,"In the current market session, Vulcan Materials Inc. (NYSE:VMC) stock price is at $226.43, after a 1.00% drop. However, over the past month, the company's stock went up by 1.40%, and in the past year, by 29.81%. Shareholders might be interested in knowing whether the stock is overvalued, even if the company is not performing up to par in the current session. Comparing Vulcan Materials P/E Against Its Peers The P/E ratio measures the current share price to the company's EPS. It is used by long-term investors to analyze the company's current performance against it's past earnings, historical data and aggregate market data for the industry or the indices, such as S&P 500. A higher P/E indicates that investors expect the company to perform better in the future, and the stock is probably overvalued, but not necessarily. It also could indicate that investors are willing to pay a higher share price currently, because they expect the company to perform better in the upcoming quarters. This leads investors to also remain optimistic about rising dividends in the future. Vulcan Materials has a lower P/E than the aggregate P/E of 53.27 of the Construction Materials industry. Ideally, one might believe that the stock might perform worse than its peers, but it's also probable that the stock is undervalued. In summary, while the price-to-earnings ratio is a valuable tool for investors to evaluate a company's market performance, it should be used with caution. A low P/E ratio can be an indication of undervaluation, but it can also suggest weak growth prospects or financial instability. Moreover, the P/E ratio is just one of many metrics that investors should consider when making investment decisions, and it should be evaluated alongside other financial ratios, industry trends, and qualitative factors. By taking a comprehensive approach to analyzing a company's financial health, investors can make well-informed decisions that are more likely to lead to successful outcomes."
