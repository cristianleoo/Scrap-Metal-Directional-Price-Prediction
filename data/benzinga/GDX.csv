2009-09-02,Gold Mining Stocks Glisten on a Mixed Tape,"As equities as a whole are little changed today, gold is trading up about 1% to $964/ounce. Gold mining stocks however are far outpacing the metal's increase. Gold Fields (GFI) is up 8%, Harmony Gold (HMY) is up 8.4%, Gammon Gold (GRS) is up 9.5%, and Barrick Gold (ABX) is up 6.5%. The gold miner's ETF (GDX) which is a broad measure of gold miners is up 6.3% today. This could be a flee to safety trade in the wake of yesterday's market sell-off."
2009-09-02,"Gold (GLD) Breaking Out of a Narrow Triangle on Charts, Silver (SLV) Continues Strong","Gold breaking out is either the reflation trade version 48.148 OR uh oh something bad is coming down the pike trade ... gold has been in a big descending triangle getting narrower and narrower; when those break out in either direction it is generally a big move.May - June 2009: $900 - $1000July: $910 - $960Aug: $930 - $970Based on today alone, the direction appears to be up ... +2.1% thus far in the yellow metal BUT to be sure we want to see it get north of $970. Volume on the gold ETF (GLD) today is massive - well over 20M shares when almost all of August has been under 10M. Silver (SLV) continues its strength that we highlighted yesterday, up another 2.6%+.One reader highlighted gold last week - I forgot who but kudos to the early call. Now we have to figure out what the message of the market is with these 2 metals aka what are HAL9000's algorithm's signaling to its microchips.EDIT 3:10 PM: Gold Miners ETF (GDX) exploding - up 7% on nearly 3x normal volume. (hat tip reader on that one too) HAL is on the move.p.s. anyone know what is going on with natural gas ? the ETF is down 8%?? UNG!Long Powershares DB Gold Double Long in fund; no personal position"
2009-09-03,Gold and Gold Miners Soar for a Second Straight Day,"Gold is up 1.8% to $994/ounce, flirting with its recent high of $1000/ounce. The metal has touched this level several times in the last 2 years, but has failed to break through each time. Gold mining stocks best measured by the Gold miners ETF (GDX) is up another 6% today on top of the 9.5% increase yesterday. Some see this sharp gold trade as a precursor to a possible positive jobs data surprise tomorrow. If the employment picture is improving it could put upward pressure on inflation."
2009-09-08,"U.S. Gold Futures Hit 6-Month High (ABX, KGC, AUY, GLD)","U.S. gold futures hit a six-month high of $1,000/oz and spot gold also rose to a six-month high. The dollar's weakness, concerns about the sustainability of the global economic recovery, and worries about inflation are said to be the influencing factors in this regard. U.S. gold futures hit a six-month high of $1,000/oz and spot gold also rose to a six-month high. The dollar's weakness, concerns about the sustainability of the global economic recovery, and worries about inflation are said to be the influencing factors in this regard. Stocks to watching on gold crossing $1000 today include: ETF SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) Kinross Gold (NYSE: KGC) New Gold (NYSE: NGD)"
2009-09-09,Tim Seymour Suggests Shorting Gold Miners (GDX),CNBC's Fast Money Tim Seymour thinks that the gold miners (AMEX: GDX) failed and that there is a short trade in these guys. Its closing price on Wednesday was $44.12 after a 2.19% drop.
2009-09-11,"Gold Close to All Time Highs Near $1,010/ounce (GLD, GDX, ABX)","Gold again pushed higher today, topping at around $1,010/ounce, up $14.60/ounce or 1.5%. This is also giving a boost to Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) up 2.2% and Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) up 1% for the day. Barrick recently removed its Gold hedges on speculation that the metal will move significantly higher from current levels. The Dollar continues to weaken and it is at its lowest in a year, which is one of the main reasons Gold and possibly even stocks have risen to recent highs."
2009-09-16,Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Poised for Another Strong Day,"The Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is poised to increase about 2.4% at the open after Gold itself increased $13/ounce to $1,019/ounce. The Gold Miners ETF has increased 25% in the past month alone, and 160% since its market crash low in late October 2008. Many investors prefer to invest in gold through the Gold Miners, since unlike the holding the metal, there are no carrying costs and investors have an actual stake in the earnings of these companies."
2009-09-18,"Should Silver Be A Part of An Inflation Hedge? (GDX, GLD, SLV, SIVR)","With Gold (NYSE: GLD) and gold miners, best measured by the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) approaching recent highs one wonders if there is another way to play the inflation hedge. Silver, although much less publicized, has also been a good hedge against inflation and a weakening US dollar over the past 2 years. An investor can invest in silver in several ways. It is possible to purchase silver miners, although since there is no silver miner ETF in existence to my knowledge one would need at least $5-10k devoted to silver alone to purchase a basket of these individual stocks. A more cost efficient way would be to purchase Ishares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) or ETFS Silver Trust (NYSE: SIVR). Both of these ETFs actually do hold physical silver bullion. Over the past 2 years Silver, like Gold, has proved to be a good diversifier and hedge against the value of the US dollar. The S&P 500 over the past 2 years is down 30%, GLD is up 40%, while SLV is up 32%, while GDX (correlated with both the metal gold and general equities) is up 10%. It seems Silver could be a worthwhile investment within ones precious metal allocation. Although with the metal up 25% over the past month investors might be wise to wait for a pull back."
2009-09-23,"Commodities and Oil Down Today (USO, IEZ, GDX, UUP)","Commodities including Oil are down today in response to a slightly higher US Dollar. The Unites States Oil ETF (NYSE: USO) and Ishares Oil Service Sector (NYSE: IEZ) are down 4.2% and 2% respectively. Oil itself is trading down 4% at $68.90/barrel. Gold is also slightly lower at $1,009/ounce. The Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is also down 1.7% and trading at $45.60/share. With the dollar, as measured by the ProShares Dollar Index ETF (NYSE: UUP) up only 0.40% today, and oil reacting strongly (down by 4%), this shows continued underlying weakness in the commodity."
2009-09-24,"6 Different ETFs For A Weakening US Dollar (IEZ, DRW, GDX, SIVR, UDN, EEM)","With floods of US dollars being deployed everywhere to help support a faltering economy many worry about the continued fall of the US Dollar. The dollar has already weakened significantly over the past 6 months to levels equal to those before the crash, but many foresee this as just the beginning. If you believe this is the case (or even a possibility) you should have at least a small percentage of your portfolio in “anti-dollar” plays. The following 6 ETFs give you different ways to accomplish this, each with a unique philosophy, market segment, and opportunity: 1) (NYSE: IEZ) Ishares Oil Service Sector ETF- This is an etf composed of oil service companies. This is an indirect play on oil prices. It does not offer a perfect correlation with oil prices, but a significant one. Also it enables an investor to actually own an income producing entity, as opposed to owning a futures fund. 2) (NYSE: DRW) Wisdomtree International Real Estate- This is an etf composed of real estate held outside of the United States. The etf sports a large dividend of 4.55% paid in other currencies. And of course real estate outside the US would increase in US dollar denominated terms if the dollar weakens all else equal. 3) (NYSE: GDX) Market Vectors Gold Miners- Invests in gold mining companies. This etf represents a similar philosophy to the IEZ. This enables exposure to gold without the drag of actually having to own the metal itself. 4) (NYSE: SIVR) ETFS Silver Trust- Invests directly in the metal silver. To my knowledge there is no Silver Mining etf, so this is the best way to play silver, which should give some exposure to precious metals outside of gold. 5) (NYSE: UDN) PowerShares US Dollar Bearish- invests in short futures contracts. This is a direct way to play a weak dollar. Negatives include costs associated with having to constantly roll over futures contracts and risk of tracking error. 6) (NYSE: EEM) Ishares Emerging Markets- invests in equities of emerging markets. This is an indirect way to play the dollar, but all else equal (a large assumption) if the dollar weakens returns with this etf will be enhanced."
2009-10-06,"Markets Push Well Higher On Weak Dollar & Higher Commodities (GLD, GDX, IEZ, SPY, UUP)","The markets are extending yesterday's gains with little resistance. The S&P 500 is up 1.8%, the NASDAQ up 2%, and the DOW up 1.7% in late morning trading. The main impedance for this move is a weaker dollar (partially caused by Australia's 0.25% rate hike) and gold's move higher (now at $1,042/ounce). There has been a strong relationship lately between the US dollar and equity prices. As one goes up the other goes down. For the past month this relationship is well evidenced by the following chart: The blue line represents the S&P 500 while the red line is a proxy for the US Dollar vs. a basket of other currencies. Today this relationship is continuing with a vengeance. Power Shares US Dollar Bullish (NYSE: UUP) is down 0.7%, while the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) is up 1.83%. Other related ETFs moving along with this trend are SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) up 2.3%, Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) up 7.5%, and Ishares Oil Equipment Index (NYSE: IEZ) up 3.2%."
2009-10-13,"Another Day; Another Fresh All-Time High For Gold (GLD, GDX)","Gold is up $11.70/ounce to $1,068.70/ounce today, which is a fresh all time high. The metal is up close to 7% over the past month, and has significant momentum as the US Dollar continues to find new lows. Look for Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) to perform well today. GLD is up 0.8% in the pre-market while GDX is up close to 2% this morning. Silver is also higher this morning at close to $18/ounce."
2009-10-19,The Week That Was - Week ending 16-Oct-09,"Though the market aggregate reacted positively throughout the week, the Bank of America (BAC) reported loses, posting a quarterly EPS of -$0.26 versus expectations of -$0.20. Leading the gaining sectors last week were the energy companies (+5.2%) with the oil prices surging to its highest levels this year at $78.75 per barrel while materials rose to (+2.2%). The most under-performers were Telecom (+0.1%) and consumer staples (+0.2%), which was low compared to what happened last week.

Leading the gaining sectors last week were the energy companies (+5.2%) with the oil prices surging to its highest levels this year at $78.75 per barrel and materials (+2.2%). The most under-performers were Telecom (+0.1%) and consumer staples (+0.2%), which was low compared to what happened last week. The Future looks bright even After Shares Of and IBM (IBM) tumbled last week with the the announcement of their quarterly results. IBM shares are believed to have fallen due to less orders for their services. While General electric felt the heat due to rise of fuel costs and the sluggish economic growth. The web search giant giants Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) shocked the financial analysts expectation when its EPS rose to $5.89 against a consensus of $5.42. This company seamed more upbeat and sounded more confident about current economic situation. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) in the Specialty - Precious Metals category emerged the best performer of the week with gold prices hitting an all-time high of $1070.20 per ounce. This trend was followed by iShares MSCI Brazil Index (EWZ)listed in the Diversified and Emerging Markets category. Ultra DJ-AIG Crude Oil ProShares(UCO), Direxion Daily Energy Bull 3X Shares(ERX) and Ultra Russell3000 ProShares(UWC) led the pack, showing the most growth in recent prices and returns."
2009-10-27,"ETFs For Tuesday Oct, 27, 2009","The ETF Professor has decided to start a new feature and that is a list of ETFs worth watching for the next trading day. Since the Professor is starting this list today, the list will apply to trade on TUESDAY OCTOBER 27, 2009. On the back of multiple earnings reports out of the steel sector, the Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) and the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) will be worth watching. Gold appears to be rebounding in the Asian session, so give the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) a look. A leveraged gold play worth watching may be the ProShares Ultra Gold ETF (NYSE: UGL). The inverse idea here might be the ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials ETF (NYSE: SMN). The UltraShort FTSE/Xinhua China25 Proshares (NYSE: FXP) could be the inverse answer to Baidu's (Nasdaq: BIDU) glum earnings report. With AGCO (NYSE: AGCO) slated to report and the market still digesting Goldman Sachs negative report about Monsanto (NYSE: MON), the Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO) is another ETF to watch. Two currency ETFs for you: If the Euro continues to sputter against the dollar, try the Market Vectors Double Short Euro ETF (NYSE: DRR). If the dollar resumes its slide, go with the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish (NYSE: UDN)."
2009-10-27,"5 Day Dollar Bounce Hurting Commodities, Gold, and Equities (GDX, UUP, CRBQ)","The inverse relationship between the US Dollar and the equity market continued to be a major driver of markets over the past 5 days. While the PowerShares US Dollar Bullish ETF (NYSE: UUP) is up slightly over 1% since Wednesday, the S&P 500 is down 2.5%. One can see the high inverse correlation of the US Dollar and equities over the past 5 days in the above chart. Commodity and gold ETFs were hit to an even greater extent. The Jeffries Global Commodity Equity ETF (NYSE: CRBQ) is down 3.4% and The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) lost 6.4% over the same period. As long as the inverse relationship continues, owning commodity/gold equities is owning high beta (recently around 2+). Usually investors hold commodities/gold as a hedge to insulate in market downturns, however right now they are moving with equities in an exaggerated fashion."
2009-10-28,"Playing The Gold / Gold Miner Valuation Differential Trade (GDX, GLD)","As most assets have been trending down over the past week or so, the commodity asset class has been hit particularly hard. But within this sector the miners have been absolutely demolished. Some analysts recently have been seeing gold miners shares trade at very high premiums to the metal itself and thought a correction might be in order. It seems they were right. Since October 13th the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down 15%, while gold itself (measured by SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE: GLD)) is down 3.5%, and the S&P 500 is down 3%. One can play the premium/discount between the metal and the miners, by shorting one ETF and going long the other. If you had the short miner/long metal trade on, you would have netted 11.5% on the premium reversion during this period."
2009-10-29,"ETFs For Thursday October 29, 2009","Here's the ETF Professor's ETF Watchlist for Thursday October 29, 2009. Is this dollar rally going to continue? Best to err on the side of caution and at least monitor the PowerShares DB U.S. Dollar Index Bullish Fund (NYSE: UUP). The Professor mentioned this one earlier this week and had you acted on the advice, you'd be up. Emerging markets look tired, so take a look at the ProShares UltraShort MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: EEV). Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) reports earnings before the bell and the stock is one of the largest holdings in the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Watch the Energy Select SPDR (NYSE: XLE) again as both Apache (NYSE: APA) and ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) report earnings. With solar stocks under some pressure and oil always in the news, the iShares S&P Global Clean Energy Index Fund (NYSE: ICLN) is worth watching. One more bearish international play for you: the Short MSCI EAFE ProShares (NYSE: EFZ)."
2009-10-30,"ETFs For Friday October 30, 2009","Here is the ETF Professor's ETF Watchlist for Friday October 30, 2009. With a spate of utilities before the bell on Friday, including Dominion Resources (NYSE: D), Constellation (NYSE: CEG) and Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK), utilities ETFs will be in play. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU) and the Utilities HOLDRs (NYSE: UTH) should be worth watching. Chevron (NYSE: CVX) reports as well so keep an eye on the iShares Global Energy ETF (NYSE: IXC). The Professor told you to watch the Market Vector Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and that was a good idea as it gained 4%, so let's go back to the well one more time. The Direxion Daily Emrg Mkts Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: EDZ) had a bearish move its own on Thursday, but is finding support at the 20-day moving average. Watch for a bounce on Friday. The Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TZA) is up nearly 20% on the week and it will be interesting to see if those bullish ways continue. Las Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS) reported earnings after the close on Thursday and got approval for its $2 billion Hong Kong IPO, so watch the thinly traded Market Vectors Gaming ETF (NYSE: BJK)"
2009-11-04,"The Top ETF Gainers Today (AGQ, GDX, GLD, EDC, EFO, IYT)","It was a busy day for Exchange traded funds as ETFs from a diverse set of industries posted gains today. The top Gainer among all ETF’s today was Proshares Ultra Silver (NYSE: AGQ) which gained 10.38% after silver prices rose behind the falling dollar. Proshares Ultra Silver measures twice the Unites States Fixed delivery price to London. With the weakening dollar, Prices of Gold rose as well, gaining a lifetime high of $1,087 an ounce. This fueled the gains for the Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) which was up 7.65% to %46.16 and up 35% year to date. Aside from the Market Vectors Gold Miners, SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) also rose slightly to 106.82, up 0.34%. With the rising ETFs for Gold, Gold related stocks also rose in trading with Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: ABX) gaining around 2.58%. Barrick Gold Corporation, the largest gold producer in Canada, is considering selling their North Mara Gold Mine in Tanzania. ABX is scheduled to release their earnings call today, after the market closes. Among US Stock related ETFs, the Direxion Daily Emerging Market Bull 3X (NYSE: EDC) have shown gains of around 9.19%. The Direxion Daily Emerging Markets Bull 3X looks to emulate 300% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. The volatility that EDC exhibited was a bit low but the index did trend higher. Ultra MSCI EAFE Proshares (EFO), an ETF that tracks a blend of Foreign Large Capital Stocks gained 5.59% and Proshares FTSE Xinhua (XPP) was up 5.88% after the fourth consecutive winning streak of China Stocks . Other ETFs that have gained today includes, iShares Dow Jones Transport Average (NYSE: IYT) which has gained 5.35% behind news of Warren Buffets’ Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) acquisition of remaining shares of Burlington Northern Santa Fe (NYSE: BNI). But Silver ETFs led the rest of the way with iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) and PowerShares DB Silver Fund (NYSE: DBS) both gaining over 5% today and over 50% for the year."
2009-11-04,"A Gold Star For Goldcorp's Earnings, ETF Play: (GDX)","Goldcorp (NYSE: GG), the world's second-largest gold miner by market value, said third-quarter earnings fell 62% to 19 cents a share, still good enough to beat Street estimates of 16 cents a share and boosted guidance for 2009 production could give the shares a jolt on Thursday. Goldcorp upped its 2009 gold production forecast to 2.4 million ounces from 2.3 million, and reduced its cost-per-ounce guidance to about $300 on a byproduct basis, down from its previous $345. The ETF Professor recommends the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) as the ETF to watch on the back of Goldcorp's earnings report. Goldcorp is the second-largest constituent in GDX. The ETF has been on fire, adding more than 9% in the past five sessions and the Goldcorp news could lift GDX higher yet again."
2009-11-09,Gold Rises Behind Weakening Dollar,"The price of Gold rose above $1,100 an ounce as it reaches into record highs. This rise in Gold prices comes after 5% of gains in the previous week after speculations that the central banks would be buying more gold to hedge against the dollar. On Monday, the dollar continued to fall after the finance ministers of the G20 met during the weekend to discuss the plans of re-balancing the global money flows. After the meeting, the dollar index dropped down 0.9% to 75, a two week low. In this year, the dollar has lost 7% against its main rival currencies. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) rose 1.93% to $47.62 behind the strength of Gold. SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) rose 0.42% to $107.43."
2009-11-10,"Commodity ETF Prices Declined After G20 meeting (SLV, SLX, GLD, GDX)","Despite the Stock market slowly recovering from the financial crisis, experts still believe that money can still be made in the commodities market. For one, the decision of the G20 to keep the stimulus measures in place will help maintain interest for Gold and Silver to hedge against the dollar. As a result, Gold has reached record highs of over $1,100 an ounce. The ETF Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) invests in Gold mining stocks and do not necessarily move proportionately to Gold prices because of fixed production costs. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF fell 0.63% to $48.90. On the other hand, SPDR Gold Trust holds directly and prices move in accordance to Gold Prices. SPDR Gold Trust fell 0.15% to $108.06. Another precious metal that is seen to react positively to the current market situation is Silver. Silver takes advantage of Hedge funds volume buying into these precious metals. In today’s trading, iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) gained 2.01% to a price of $16.94. Aside from the stimulus plan, all the fundamental reasons for the rise of commodity prices are still there. For example China still makes use of Coal for their power production. This makes Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL) a very promising holding. Market Vectors Coal ETF is trading at $3.48 for a 1.88% loss. Demand for infrastructure among developing countries will also contribute to the need for less than precious metals. Market Vectors Steel (NYSE: SLX) fell 1.65% and Powershares DB Base Metals ETF (NYSE: DBB) fell 0.45% to $19.71."
2009-11-10,New Gold Mining Slated To Begin Trading On Nov. 11 (GDXJ),"The ETF Professor has mentioned the Market Vector Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) quite a few times as gold has been making new highs and that's been the right thing to do as GDX is up about 6% in the past five days. So the question becomes if you like GDX will you love its junior equivalent? That's right, the Market Vector Junior Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is slated to begin trading on Wednesday November 11, 2009. GDXJ is comprised of about 40 small and midcap companies from around the world that derive at least 50% of their revenue from gold and silver mining. Regional exposure is heavily biased to North America with Canada accounting for 62% of GDXJ's holdings and the U.S. making up another 20%. Perhaps you're like the ETF Professor in that you get a lot of those annoying emails (and some snail mail) talking about yet another gold penny stock poised to rise from 50 cents to $20. Well, every now and then those stocks do provide good returns. If nothing else junior miners are volatile and that could mean there will be some good trading opportunities with GDXJ. If you're looking to speculate on the junior miners and can't pick just one or two, GDXJ could be for you. From an investment standpoint, the Professor still prefers GDX, but the little brother could be worth watching."
2009-11-10,"ETFs To Watch On November 10, 2009 (HHH, GLD, EWA, EWZ, UYG)","Here is the ETF Professor's ETF Watchlist for Tuesday November 10, 2009. Play Priceline.com's (Nasdaq: PCLN) stellar earnings report on raised fourth-quarter guidance with the Internet HOLDRs ETF (AMEX: HHH). Priceline is the fifth-largest holding in HHH. Needing no explanation as to why it's a good idea to watch them are the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE: GLD) and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Let's watch the iShares Dow Jones US Technology (NYSE: IYW) for any movement out of Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) related to the EU's move to possibly block the software maker's acquisition of Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: JAVA). The Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX) has been on fire over the past week, up close to 15%. Keep an eye on it. The iShares Brazil Index (NYSE: EWZ) closed within three cents of its October high of $77.07 and has been one of the most consistently bullish emerging markets ETFs in 2009. One more international play: The iShares MSCI Australia Index (NYSE: EWA). EWA up 4.5% on Monday. Here's a bullish leveraged play for the rise in materials stocks: The Ultra Basic Materials ProShares (NYSE: UYM). Try the Materials Select SPDR (NYSE: XLB) if you don't want a leveraged ETF. Here's a triple leveraged play it large caps continue to lead the market higher: The Direxion Daily Large Cap Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: BGU)."
2009-11-10,"Stocks Slip Slightly As Effects OF G20 Meeting Settle Down  (DFT, BA, MMM, GLD, GDX)","After Monday’s rally of stocks which took the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a 13 month high, US Stock opened slightly lower as investors sell shares in order to realize gains. Monday’s Surge was due to the G20’s decision to continue the stimulus plans in place while the world economy recovers. In morning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 3.40 points or 0.03% to 10,223.54 while the S&P500 lost 0.06% and The NASDAQ composite index dropped 0.03% to 2,153.46. Oil futures also fell in unison with US Stocks. The most affected stocks were Dupont (NYSE: DFT) and Boeing (NYSE: BA) which fell 4.34% and 1.25% respectively. Gainers among US stocks includes 3M Company (NYSE: MMM) which rose 0.89% and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) which gained 0.57%. Aside from US Stocks, European Shares also dropped slightly as the index for Paris dropped 0.25%, Frankfurt stocks fell 0.11%, and London stocks dropped 0.12%. While stocks fell, Gold remained relatively steady. Market Vector’s Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) rose slightly to $49.66 or 0.75% and SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) gained 0.35% to $108.58."
2009-11-11,Well-Timed Launch For New Junior Gold ETF: GDXJ,"Investment success often lies in timing. Van Eck Global may have hit the nail on the head with today’s introduction of Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ). With gold bullion breaking above $1,100 earlier this week, gold stocks are flying. GDXJ follows the also very successful Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), launched back in 2006. The difference lies in that word “Junior.” GDX includes large-cap global mining companies; GDXJ is focused on much smaller gold miners and prospectors. The weighted average market capitalization of GDX constituents was $15.2 billion as of 9/30/09. In the index tracked by GDXJ, it was only $850 million. These dynamic companies are notoriously volatile but can climb at an astonishing rate under the right conditions. Now may be just such a time. The dollar is in a downtrend in terms of gold, the greenback, and just about every other currency. Capital is pouring into the sector. More than a few investors want to get aboard the smaller companies that are developing new discoveries. The top holdings in GDXJ at its launch are: Coeur d’Alene Mines (CDE), 6.6% New Gold (NGD), 5.6% Silver Standard Resources (SSRI), 5.4% Hecla Mining (HL), 5.2% Gammon Gold (GRS), 4.7% Alamos Gold (AGI), 4.3% Semafo (SMF.CN), 3.8% Silvercorp Metals (SVM), 3.7% European Goldfields (EGU), 3.4% Golden Star Resources (GSS), 3.34% These top ten holdings collectively represent about 46% of GDXJ, leaving the balance to be split among 27 smaller positions. Geographically, the portfolio is heavily tilted towarded Canadian-based companies at 62.6% with the U.S. and Australia far behind. In mining, a company’s domicile is probably less relevant than the location of its properties, which is often far from headquarters. The minimum market capitalization to be included in GDXJ is $150 million, so the most speculative penny stocks are not represented. GDXJ has a net expense ration of 0.60%. Trading volume was good on opening day and I expect this ETF to stay off of Deathwatch, thanks to Van Eck’s excellent timing and the fact it covers a niche without a lot of competition. More information can be found at the sponsor’s GDXJ page. Disclosure compliant with FTC 16 CFR Part 255 covering writer, editor, and publisher: Long GSS.

2009-11-12,Little Brother In Focus: Market Vector Junior Miners ETF ,"Market Vector Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has been in the spotlight since the ETF is up about 6% in the past five days. The junior equivalent of the GDX, the Market Vector Junior Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) will be in focus when its lists on November 11, 2009. The GDXJ is comprised of about 40 small and midcap companies from around the world that derive at least 50% of their revenue from gold and silver mining. The regional exposure is heavily biased to North America with Canada accounting for 62% of the GDXJ's holdings and the U.S. making up another 20%. The junior ETF provides a good trading opportunity for traders who want to negate the selection risk while trading junior mining stocks. Jim Cramer has been heavily recommending going long Gold. Cramer said “The present gold rally, with the commodity up 26% year-to-date, a huge positive.” The GDX was up 0.48% at $ 49.90 at the time of writing. Read more about this in Benzinga"

Japan issued a surprising GDP, showing its economy grew 4.8% in the third quarter, well above the 2.7% economists were expecting. The ETF plays are the iShares MSCI Japan Index (NYSE: EWJ) and the SPDR Russell/Nomura Small Cap Japan ETF (NYSE: JSC). The Professor thought it was interesting that a recent ETF report on short interest showed consumer staples ETFs sport massive interest, so watch the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP). Barron's issued a bullish report on FedEx (NYSE: FDX), so it might be worth watching the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Transportation (NYSE: IYT) in addition to FedEx shares. Barron's also spoke glowlingly of ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) and that stock comprises nearly 20% of the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE: XLE). The dollar should continue to make headlines and probably negative ones at that. Watch the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish (NYSE: UDN). High yield bond ETFs have been getting some attention lately. Check out the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE: HYG). Let's make our financial play the Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSE: VFH). The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) continues to move higher. Put it on your list."

Investors are looking to be cautious as the price approaches the $1,200 level. Experts see the uptrend to continue as the price of Gold rose 7 out of the 10 days.

2009-11-19,John Paulson Set to Launch Gold (GLD) Hedge Fund,"I keep looking for something that marks at least an intermediate term top in gold, i.e. a magazine cover indicator aka when everyone is on the same side of the trade and even your barber starts talking up gold stocks. This doesn't mean the thesis is not correct in the long run, but let's keep an eye out. The latest bit of piling on in the gold trade is infamous hedge fund manager John Paulson - who already holds enormous amounts of gold in his main fund (over 8% of the entire SPRD Gold Shares (GLD) ETF!) - opening a gold specific hedge fund, partially just to find a place to protect his wealth from the ravages of central bankers. He will be putting $250M of his own money into the fund. At this point if John Paulson was his own country he'd be somewhere in the 16-20th range in terms of largest gold holdings... I guess he wants to make a run for top 10 status - remarkable. [Oct 13, 2009: Largest Gold Reserves by Country] Hedge fund manager John Paulson, who raked in $20 billion in 2007 by betting against financials and all things subprime, is looking to grow his gold stash with a new fund, tapping into investor concern about a weak U.S. dollar and inflation. According to the WSJ, the famed money manager will launch in January 1st a fund dedicated to buying up shares of gold miners and other bullion-related investments. The new fund will invest in gold-related shares and gold derivatives and will aim to outperform gold prices. Mr. Paulson, who spoke about the fund at a meeting with his investors in New York, argued that the bull run was only beginning for the precious metal. He said he was starting it in part to give himself more personal exposure to gold. Paulson is already a major holder of gold. For the past year or so he has been building gold positions in the firm’s current funds. His investments include shares of Johannesburg-based gold producer AngloGold Ashanti Ltd (AU). The billionaire manager also has a large stake in Gold Fields (GFI), Kinross Gold (KGC), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) and SPDR Gold EFT (GLD) in which he has over 31 million shares or 8.6%. Mr. Paulson currently has more than 10% of his $30 billion or so under management in gold-related investments, according to his investors. He is estimated to be worth about $6 billion, and plans to invest as much as $250 million of his own money in the new fund.

2009-11-23,"As Gold Touches A Record, (GLD) and (GDX) Are Up","As the world continues to worry about the weakness of the dollar, investors persist in chasing gold. Gold touched a record high - $1,167.45 an ounce – crossing many technical resistance points. Gold’s record rise also pushed up ETF’s in gold. Since the beginning of the year, SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) has risen 30% and Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF) (NYSE: GDX) has risen 50%. CNN (NYSE: TWC) says that it is not just gold that investors are buying. As dollar becomes cheaper, dollar priced commodities – like crude – also become cheaper for those who hold other currencies. So, investors are betting on dollar priced commodities as well. Technical analysts at Barclay’s Capital feel that there is a lot of upside in Gold. They target a price of $1,175 per ounce by December 31st. The prices of other precious metals are also up. CNN quoted ETF Securities saying that its holdings in platinum and palladium backed exchange traded commodities touched record highs last Friday. SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) and Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF) will continue to do very well thanks to a declining dollar."
2009-11-24,"Gold Continues Its Run (NEM, GLD, GDX, KGC, ABX)","The weaker dollar has once again proven to be the trigger for rising gold prices. Miners are in good position to exploit the weakness of the U.S. currency, and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) President and CEO Richard O’Brien has the strategy to do it. He said in an interview that the right formula is to produce all you can, as fast as you can, at the lowest cost you can. O'Brien said that the dollar has weakened because of the rising federal budget deficit, but he expects it to eventually rebound which will make gold prices retreat. Newmont Miners (NEM) gained around 2% on Monday and closed at $53.34. Some of the gold related ETFs had a good return in the last month. SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) gained 11.5% in November, while Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF) (NYSE: GDX) added almost 22% this month. If you prefer stocks instead, you would have gained 7.1% with Kinross Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE: KGC) in the month of November, while Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE: ABX) would bring you a yield of 22.12% in the same period. Yamana Gold Inc. (USA) (NYSE: AUY) was pretty successful too this month, it added 27.7%. Goldcorp Inc. (USA) (NYSE: GG) was also a pretty good stock to own, it gained 20.5% so far this month, while AngloGold Ashanti Limited (ADR) (NYSE: AU) added 19.5%."

(USA) (NYSE: AUY) or Goldcorp Inc. (USA) (NYSE: GG). It has also shown us some weird stuff – the latest being fleets of armored truck which are carrying mounds of gold bars and coins out of HSBC’s vault in New York City's Fifth Avenue. The reason: HSBC, with one of the largest vaults in the US, has nowhere to store all its customers' gold. So it is moving out small gold holdings from retail clients to make way for more lucrative institutional customers. Many vaults are feeling the pressure of the gold rush amidst continuing worries about the recession and a declining dollar. Gold gained $17.90, or 1.6%, to $1164.30 an ounce on Monday; it has already gained a record 32% this year. Investors are not content with investing in financial contracts linked to gold, like SPDR Gold Trust (ETF), Market Vectors Gold Miners(ETF), Kinross Gold Corporation (USA), Yamana Gold Inc. (USA) or Goldcorp Inc. (USA), but are keen on possessing the metal itself as it continues to set new records."

The company, which updated its 2009 mining exploration program in a press release yesterday, indicated that its program has been successful. “The ability to grow organically is a key strategic attribute of Goldcorp, and the high quality of our operations and development projects makes that organic growth possible,” said Goldcorp President and Chief Executive Officer Chuck Jeannes. “The broad-based exploration success we are experiencing is a direct result of an asset portfolio that is young, long-lived and highly prospective. This combination of very low finding costs for new gold ounces with the lowest cash operating costs in the industry translates into outstanding leverage to gold prices for our shareholders,” Jeannes. Many mining stocks are in the green today, including Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE: ABX), up $0.75 or 1.74%, to $43.77; Newmont Mining Corp., (NYSE: NEM), up $1.17 or 2.19% to $54.52; and Harmony Gold Mining Co. Ltd. (AMEX: HMY), up 4.39% or $0.47 to $11.17.

2009-11-27,"Gold Rush For Retail Investors: American Eagle Goes Out Of Inventory, GLD, GDX","The rush by retail investors into gold has forced the US government to suspend sales of the world’s most popular bullion coin, the American Eagle, after running out of inventories. The sale of mint, though limited in quantity, is used by investors to gauge the appetite of retail investors. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal, the US Mint has sold about 1.19m ounces of American Eagles so far this year, up almost 75 per cent from the same period last year. This shortage, happening second time after the shortage in August 2008, is the latest sign of investors seeking a safe haven into bullion amid the decline of the US dollar. The stoppage helped to push gold prices yesterday to a fresh all-time high of $1,194.90 a troy ounce, up 0.5 per cent on the day. Both SPDR Gold Trust (ETF)(NYSE: GLD) and Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF)(NYSE: GDX) showed positive results."
2009-12-04,"Gold Futures Dropped Behind Positive Jobs Data (GLD, GDX, GOLD, NEM, FCX) ","The extended winning streak of Gold futures was recently halted as the prices of futures went down $50. This marks the largest one day decline for Gold Futures in the last 20 months which included a string of record highs in the recent weeks. The decline of Gold was brought about by the stronger than expected economic data that boosted the dollar against the currency’s major rivals, showing that the US economy is improving faster than initially thought. However, this is a major concern among market participants because this could mean a prolonged decline for Gold if the surge of the dollar continues. Experts speculate that the price of Gold may have peaked as the economy stabilizes. The price of December Gold Futures in the Comex Division of the NY Mercantile Exchange fell 3.99% to $1,169.50 an ounce. Moving the opposite direction, the ICE Futures US Dollar Index went up 1.5% to 75.805 points after Gold Prices settled. With the less than favorable outlook in Gold, Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) dropped 5.31% to fall to $50.68 a share. SPDR Gold trust (NYSE: GLD) also suffered a steep decline as it dropped 4.16% to finish at $113.75 a share. The shares of companies heavily invested in Gold also fell. Rangold Resources Limited (NASDAQ: GOLD) saw their shares drop 4.26% behind the drop of Gold prices. Rangold is in the business of mining and exploring for Gold.

2009-12-04,Jim Rogers – Gold Price Rise Due To Budget Deficits,"Jim Rogers, an economics pundit and creator of the Rogers International Commodities Index, said in an interview with Business Week that the chief reason behind the rise in the gold price is global budget deficits. According to Rogers, such deficits, currently widespread in the developed world, are pushing demand for perceived “safe harbor” hard assets like gold. He said that central banks are now overwhelmingly buyers of the precious metal, as opposed to several years ago when they were largely sellers. Rogers says that he is among the ranks of pessimists for the U.S. dollar’s prospects, however he added that there are currently “so many pessimists that I suspect there’s a rally coming… things usually do rally when you have this many bears at the same time.” Gold hit a high of over $1,200 an ounce in the very early days of December; it has since eased somewhat from that level. Gold-related stocks have been affected by the performance of the metal. Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) is off its weekly high but is trading up after hours 4 cents to $42.36, while Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD) has added 53 cents to $82.75.

Meredith Whitney is maintaining her bearish stance on the markets. She says the governnment is now out of bullets to support the economy. She says if the economy doesn't slow down now, it will in Q1. Whitney said nothing has changed other than the banks refinancing themselves. Meredith Whitney's comments could help drive down the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) in the pre-market. Whitney says the overall market is extended. Meredith said she is 100% confident that the consumer is not getting any better and since 70% of the economy is supported by the consumer, the S&P 500 will likely fall in 2010. She'd make not only a bearish bet on financials such as the XLF or the Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: FAZ), commonly referred to as the FAZ, but also on the S&P 500 or an ETF play, SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). If Meredith is correct about 2010, investors should look to safe havens like cash and gold. A good way to play gold is to buy gold etfs, such as SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) or the Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX). The GLD and GDX have already risen 30% and 46% respectively year to date."

Assured Guaranty (NYSE: AGO), the municipal bond insurer, got the entire playing field to itself after the speculation in mortgage-backed securities knocked out competitors MBIA (NYSE: MBI) and Ambac (NYSE: ABK). Also, Altucher likes that municipal bond defaults stood at just 0.14% this year. 2. Wellcare Health Plans (NYSE: WCG) has resolved its issues with Medicare and James thinks Wellcare will be in great demand as a mediator between the corporate and the government. 3. Rapid urbanization and the consequent need for high soil fertility and yields is what will drive Potash (NYSE: POT) in 2010. Altucher also likes that Potash also represents George Soros’ third largest position. 4. Cash America (NYSE: CSH) has been riding high as the new financier to the sub-prime community. Altucher says that most people pawn gold in a pawnshop and that makes the pawnshop chain a backdoor means to play an increase in gold prices. Other ways to play gold are through ETFS like SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) and Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF) (NYSE: GDX). 5. Medical supplier Becton, Dickinson (NYSE: BDX) is Warren Buffet’s latest investment and and BDX has raised its payout for the 37th straight year. Becton looks set to grow with the medical needs of an aging Baby Boomer population. 6. Hillenbrand (NYSE: HI) has a virtual monopoly on the casket industry, catering to 16,000 of the 22,000 funeral homes in the U.S, says Altucher. Favorable demographic and past dividend trends make Hillenbrand a good buy. 7. Altucher likes Telecom Corp of New Zealand (NYSE: NZT) because it is a monopoly in its home country. Also, Altucher likes NZT in 2010 because the Kiwi dollar is the currency most closely correlated to gold prices. 8. STEC (Nasdaq: STEC) faced a problem when EMC (NYSE: EMC) had an inventory glut of their SSD product. .However, a price target of $42 for this $12 stock suggest things are better than they seem for STEC. 9. Alvarion (NASDAQ: ALVR) supplies WiMax networks to the developing world. Altucher said this is a high growth area and ALVR is trading cheap. 10. Altucher thinks GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) could do well in 2010 as it is another stock that Buffett holds for the same reason as Becton Dickinson."

Year 2009 saw a depreciating Dollar and consequently, the Gold and the other commodities recorded healthy upward trend. In the last few weeks, Gold has broken many all-time high records. Skeptics have claimed that rise in commodities is due to depreciation in Dollar and not due to change in the intrinsic value. This assertion was further corroborated by the fact that the recent advances in Dollar have beaten down commodities prices. SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY)(FREE stock trend analysis) closed the week with marginal gain. However, the Gold story is still far from over. Gold Future contracts saw a heavy selling last weekend. However, the open interest remained unchanged. A heavy selling can be explained by the fact that the most of the traders cannot afford to carry forward their positions and hence tend to offload them at the end of the day. Instead of signaling the end of trend, last week’s losses in Gold have only made it a more attractive buy and both SPDR and Market Vectors should make the most of it."

2009-12-22,Overview Of David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital,"David Einhorn has established himself as one of Wall Street's savviest money managers in the wake of the economic crisis. Einhorn runs Greenlight Capital, a $2.6 billion value oriented New York hedge fund. His fund has produced net annualized returns in excess of 25% since its inception in 1996. Einhorn recieved widespread recognition after taking a substantial short position in Lehman Brothers beginning in July 2007. He later went public with his view that Lehman was undercapitalized, had massive CDO exposure and was using dubious accounting practices. Lehman declared bankruptcy in September of 2008, triggering a global market meltdown. So where is Einhorn placing his bets these days? As of September, 2009 Greenlight's portfolio was allocated as follows; Financials (24.69%), Healthcare (20.48%), Technology (17.18%), Services (10.75%), and Energy (7.04%). His top five positions were Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Carefusion Corp. (NYSE:CFN), Cardinal Health (NYSE: CAH), Teradata Corp (NYSE: TDC), and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Einhorn is a notorious gold bug and has built up a significant poition in physical gold bullion that is being held at an undisclosed location in Manhattan. Another interesting position that Einhorn has taken in recent months is purchasing contracts that will increase in value if Japanese interest rates rise. During a presentation at the Value Investing Congress, Einhorn stated that Japan may be past the point of no return, citing a Japanese debt to GDP ratio of nearly 2 to 1 as being a potential catalyst for exploding interest rates. Einhorn's contracts, bought from major banks, are tied to interest rates four to five years out."

This could further hit gold prices as it did earlier in the month on similar fears. Spot gold was trading at $1,095.97 an ounce, up 0.3% from Monday’s close. Gold prices have been very volatile with the 52 week range for Market Vectors Gold Miners being $27.15-$55.40 and the SPDR Gold Trust being $78.87-$119.54. Gold for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange was at $1,097 an ounce."

2009-12-30,"Healthy Markets Have Corrections. (NYSE: FNM, FRE, C, WFC, GS)","Since the March low when the SPX traded at 666 the market has had a rally beyond comparison. The SPX is currently trading at 1125 and this is a 460 point move in ten short months. It is important to realize since this bull run began that the market has not experienced a single 10 percent correction. This is not healthy action. This is a market on steroids and as we all know using artificial hormones are not healthy and can sometimes cause or lead to death. Therefore, it is still amazing that the majority of the talking heads in the media and the government believe this is a solid recovery. Let’s look at some of the medication that this market is taking. First we have the Fed funds rate at zero percent. This is artificially low interest rates set by the Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Ben Bernanke. The last time rates were at 1.00 percent by Alan Greenspan in the early 2000's we developed the credit and housing bubble. It still amazes me that interest rates are not set by supply and demand. I guess the powers that be enjoy bubbles. Next on the list the market has massive global government stimulus plans and bailouts taking place. Someone has to pay for this money being printed and used in the future. Remember there are no free lunches in this world. 'Cash for clunkers', the $8,000 home buyer tax credit, modified mortgages and extended unemployment benefits all add and increase to the problem. Again, who is going to pay for this? This makes the Bernie Madoff ponzi scheme seem like the man dressed as Santa Clause taking a few bucks out of the Salvation Army donation cup I front of the local supermarket. What ever happened to true old fashioned capitalism, when companies could fail? It was survival of the fittest. Not survival of the fattest like American International Group (NYSE: AIG), Fannie Mae (NYSE: FNM), Freddie Mac(NYSE: FRE), Citi Group (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), JP Morgan Chase(NYSE: JPM), and even Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS). This government actually rejoiced and helped these institutions get even bigger during the latest crisis of 2008. Wasn't the Glass-Steagal Act of 1933 put in for a reason? This act was designed to prevent commercial banks from engaging in investment banking activities. Since the recent economic crisis occurred these institutions have and do even more investment banking. What a joke. Oh I forgot they can blame the removal of the up-tick rule or the short sellers for all their problems and not their gluttony and greed. There are bright spots and one true bull market out there. It simply looks to be the gold market. Gold has been rising for about nine years now. There have been corrections along the way on light volume and this telling us that this market is healthy. Gold miners are another section that has performed very well; however, the commodity is the pure play. Gold could have a long way to go as the central banks in the world continue to print money as they desperately try to inflate the markets back to health. Remember gold is the one true currency from the beginning of time. There are many ways to play gold. One can use the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), Central Fund of Canada(AMEX: CEF), and Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX). There are numerous individual gold miners such as Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), and Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) just to name a few. Nicholas Santiago, Chief Market Strategists www.InTheMoneyStocks.com"
2009-12-30,"Marc Faber Does Not See Gold Rallying In 2010 (GLD, GDX)","Marc Faber told Squawk Box that 2009 was an excellent year for capital gains because the market was extremely oversold in the beginning of 2009. Faber said since March, the S&P is up 70%, but you won't see these kind of gains in 2010. Marc Faber said 2010 will be a year when capital preservation will be more important because he expects a lot of volatility. He says equities could fall 10 to 20%. Faber has no specific conclusion on how 2010 will end. Gold: Faber does not think gold (SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF) (NYSE: GDX)) will rally that much in 2010, but he thinks gold is y good insurance to own if there are troubling times in 2010. Faber said the S&P has traded essentially sideways since October (we are up 2% on the S&P since October 21st). He sees the S&P either breaking up to the upside approximately 15% and then there will be a more meaningful correction of around 20% or we could correct here 10% to 20% and then have another run to the upside. He said he's not certain yet what will happen, but the next few days will be important to watch. We will be meeting with Marc next week so we will be able to get a follow-up for you on that above question next week. Faber said putting money into treasuries is not a good idea as a long-term investment, but near-term stocks are a bit overbought and US treasury bonds are oversold. Also, Faber doesn't like how negative the sentiment is on treasuries so Marc thinks that there could be a rebound in treasuries for one to three months. Faber says does not see much deleveraging as the government continues to leverage up while the private sector continues to deleverage. Five years from now, Faber thinks equity prices will be significantly higher, the dollar significantly lower and gold significantly higher. Marc Faber is the editor of The Gloom, Boom & Doom report."

The IMF stated that the industrialization of emerging countries supports consumption, as a result of which commodity prices might remain high by historical standards in the long term. In the near term, commodity prices are likely to surge upwards, with global activity expected to grow significantly, according to the IMF. Following the predictions made by the IMF and a weakening US dollar, commodity stocks moved up on the first trading day of the year. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc (NYSE: FCX) shares have risen by 3.49% and AK Steel Holding’s (NYSE: AKS) stock has climbed 5.53% to $22.53. Meanwhile, Dupont (NYSE: DD) shares are up 2.85% to 34.63, SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) moved up 2.43% and Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) rose 3.59%. Also helping commodities was a weak US dollar, which fell 0.5% against a basket of currencies. . Oil prices have crossed $80 a barrel and February crude futures gained 2.1% to reach a two-month high. Russia’s oil pricing dispute with Belarussian refineries has pushed up oil prices. With oil prices moving up and extra security checks hindering plane movements, US airline stocks are suffering. Shares of Continental Airlines Inc (NYSE: CAL) have slipped by 1.73% to $17.61, of AMR Corporation (NYSE: AMR) by 2.30% to $7.55 and of Delta Air Lines Inc (NYSE: DAL) by 2.64% to $11.08."
2010-01-04,"Gold Gains Traction (GLD, GDX, IAG, NEM, ABX)","Analysts at Thomas Weisel Partners Group Inc. (NASDAQ: TWPG) have released a report on the gold mining companies. Gold ended the year at $1097/oz. The price of gold exhibited strength from August to early December 2009. According to analysts, the key events for the increase in gold price were the Fed’s quantitative easing announcement in mid-March, China’s announcement of increased gold reserves in April, and India’s purchase of IMF gold in October. Analysts believe that the positive trend in gold prices will continue with ongoing concerns about fiscal and monetary policies. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) was trading at $109.86 and the Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF) (NYSE: GDX) was trading at $47.83. The 52 week range for the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) has been between $78.87-$119.54, whereas the 52-week range for the Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF) has been between $27.15-$55.40. The share price performance among gold producers year-over-year was mixed according to the report. According to analysts, year-end shares outstanding will increase 10% for gold producers primarily due to equity raisings. According to analysts net debt is expected to fall 16%. Among the developers there has been an increasing reliance on project financing. According to the report the seniors have been able to borrow at corporate level. P/NAV multiples at spot gold continued to contract according to the report from 1.40x to 1.16x. The trend reflects the acceptance of higher gold prices, widening operating margins, equity dilution and declining exploration success. Analysts at Thomas Weisel have an Overweight rating for IAMGOLD Corporation (NYSE: IAG) and Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM) and Market weight rating for Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: ABX)."

From a technical perspective, gold is poised for further gains, said analysts who study past price movements for clues to future trading patterns. Other commodities such as industrial metals also climbed, with copper rising to its highest since August 2008. Some of the gold ETFs set to do well include Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF) (NYSE: GDX) and SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD)."
2010-01-07,"Gold Finishes Lower After Pressure from the Dollar (ABX, GOLD, GLD, GDX)","Gold futures declined today as a reaction to the stronger dollar. In addition to the stronger dollar, traders also sold off previously bought positions before the US Jobs report comes out this Friday. January Gold futures fell to $1,133.10 per ounce in the New York Mercantile Exchange Comex Division. February futures also fell $2.80 to $1,133.70. Traditionally, Gold is seen as a hedge for the dollar, so when the dollar rises, the price of this precious metal decreases. The rise of the dollar that contributed to the drop in Gold prices can also be attributed to the stronger tone it showed as Japan’s Finance Minister said that he was looking for a softer Yen. In addition, China has sold its benchmarked three month bills at 1.3684%, showing a shift in policy towards preempting inflation risks. The better than expected US Initial Jobless claims also played a good part in the increase of the dollar. Silver, on the other hand, fared better than Gold, with a gain of 17 cents to $18,345. Traders will be more likely to buy silver because it will be more active as it has more industrial use than Gold. Hedge funds are also known to buy more of this metal than they do of Gold. Stocks that deal with the storing, processing and mining of Gold were also affected by the drop in Gold Prices. Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE: ABX) dropped 1.41% to $41.17 a share, Randgold Resources Ltd. (NASDAQ: GOLD) dropped 0.50% to $83.90 a share, and Gold Fields Ltd fell 2.50% to $13.52 a share. Some Gold companies fared better, like Kinross Gold Corp which went up 0.20% to $20.12 a share, Compania de Minas Buenaventura Sa (NYSE: BVN) edged up 1.29% to $37.69 a share, and Paramount Gold and Silver Corp (AMEX: PZG) went up 10.19% to $1.73 a share. Exchange Traded Funds were also affected by the drop in Gold Prices as Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) dropped 0.45% to $49.12 a share.

2010-01-08,"Weak Job Data Pulls Down Stock Markets (KO, BA, JPM, IAG, GDX, GLD)","The much-awaited employment report was weak, with data showing a net loss of 85,000 jobs in December. The report suggested that US companies are taking things one at a time and are in no hurry to re-hire, despite the resumption of economic growth in 3Q09. The employment data went against the general perception of analysts and investors, who believed that the report would show that hiring was finally catching up with the recovery. Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, commented that the nation should expect gradual improvement in the job market, as economic recovery continues to be bogged down by tight credit, long-term unemployment and cautious spending habits of consumers and business. Weak employment data reversed the direction of the stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial average (NASDAQ: INDU) slipped by 22 points, or 0.2%, as it took the hit from Boeing (NYSE: BA), Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). The S&P 500 index (NYSE: SPX) lost 3 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite (NASDAQ: COMP) fell by 4 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, gold has inched higher.

2010-01-12,Will Gold Maintain Its Luster And Continue Stellar Performance In 2010?,"If gold rises to and holds above $1,167 an ounce for two days, it could again breach the $1,200 barrier, say market analysts. The immediate prediction is that gold will rise above $1,190 an ounce. After an exciting 6 month rally in which gold prices moved from below $900 an ounce to over $1200, gold dipped in a profit taking correction at the end of last month to just below $1100 an ounce. Gold prices were mostly flat around $1,150 per ounce on Tuesday after touching a five-week high in the previous session as traders continued to watch the currency market for direction. It shows an upward trend, a sign that the next leg in the gold price rally may well be underway. Three ETFs that will likely reap the benefits of an appreciation in gold prices include: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and The PowerShares DB Gold (NYSE:DGL). Gold hit an all-time high in 2009, marking the ninth straight year that prices increased. Some suggest its uptrend will come to an end, however, there are numerous forces indicating the contrary. The first supporting force behind gold's strength is the unconventional policies of the U.S. Federal Reserve. The Fed is expected to maintain its short-term nominal interest rate target near or at zero through 2010, which is likely to provide strong support to gold prices. Secondly, gold has turned into more than just an insurance policy against a falling stock market; it has turned into an enhanced returning investment vehicle. Traditionally, the metal has been used as a protection mechanism against market volatility and inflation and generally has an inverse relationship with the stock market. Source Gold has enjoyed a long and enviable climb, rising some 380 percent from a cyclical low near $255 an ounce in April 2001 to an all-time high just over $1,225 in early December, 2009. Although the bull market will celebrate its 9th birthday this year, it still has a long way to go, both in magnitude and duration."

2010-01-26,"Oh, it's still all about the dollar ","Today the DXY (U.S. Dollar index) gapped above its daily 200 moving average only to pull back shortly after the open. When the dollar pulls back commodities and inflationary stocks are free to run higher, and usually do. Today we are seeing many of the gold mining stocks trading higher such as Newmont Mining Corp (NYS: NEM), Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE: AUY), and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Agriculture stocks such as Potash (NYSE: POT), and Monsanto (NYSE: MON) which are inflationary plays have also traded higher on the back of the intra-day dollar pullback. Since 2001 the U.S. Dollar has been declining. In 2002 the DXY (U.S. Dollar index) was trading around 120.00. In March 2008, it traded at a low of 70.70. Since the 2000 stock market top many are calling the stock market the lost decade as the Dow Jones Industrial Average is below its 2000 level. Remember in the 1990's the dollar was the world’s strongest currency. In September 1992 the DXY traded at a low of 78.19. This was also the low for the dollar as the stock market was near the end of a recession and a new administration was taking over. As the dollar strengthened in the 1990's so did the stock market. Now the stock market only rallies when the dollar declines. This is how important the weak U.S. Dollar has become over the last decade for stocks. There can only be one reason for this reversal of fortune in the dollar as it has fallen from grace, and it is simply, DEFLATION. The Federal Reserve Bank and the U.S. Treasury are fighting deflation. The way they are trying to fight deflation is by simply inflating the economy back to health. The high prices of gold are telling us this. Gold is at all time highs while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is below its 2000 stock market high. The cost of most goods and services are cheaper than ever. Take a computer for example; ten years ago a computer would cost over $1000.00, today a much better computer costs less than $500 bucks. Airlines are another industry group facing the deflationary headwinds. Plane tickets are sometimes cheaper than a Greyhound bus ticket. The airlines simply do not have any pricing power. On the flip side of this coin are the high energy, commodity, food and agriculture prices. The necessities are expensive. It is starting to seem a lot like Japan in the United States now. Please recognize, Japan has been fighting deflation since 1989 with little or no success. The Japanese Nikkei index topped out at 40,000 and has been trading around 10,000 currently. This could be what is in store for the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the next ten years as well. I'm not convinced that the solution to this problem is to inflate your way back to health; if that can even be accomplished with huge unemployment, and a massive housing crisis. Capitalism can be cruel sometimes for many. When you live by the sword you must die by the sword. However, it does work when it is left alone to do its job. The secret to capitalism is failure. Yes, companies must be allowed to fail. If they are not allowed to fail then we will have to deal with the repercussions. Unfortunately, this will mean many years of choppy markets, lacking real movement which may even go lower before things get better.

This gold bull began at $250 9 years ago, and Gold bug such as hedge funds manager John Paulson believes it may peak well above $2,125 an ounce before this one's over. Last Thursday Gold price plummeted $50 as mounting debt worries out of Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain (PIGS countries) and boosted the dollar to a multi-month high. Is it still a good time to jump on the bandwagon? 4 Reasons to Hold Gold 1. Even though we're still in a deflationary environment, there will be a time when we have to worry about inflation as government spending continues to grow. 2. Central banks like India and China hold much more of their reserves in the U.S. dollar than in gold for economic and political reasons, but there's a clear, long-term diversification away from the greenback and Gold is benefit from this trend. 3. Gold’s price is highly correlated with political instability and has negative correlation with stock market (http://seekingalpha.com/article/149636-portfolio-diversification-is-key-consider-these-etfs). 4.

Conclusion According to Douglas Breeden, professor of Duke University, historical statistics are insufficient for accurately assessing risk. Since 1975, housing prices have never declined in the U.S. for a full 5 to 10 year period. Yet, price declines have occurred in 2008 and 2009 that have never been seen, or even imagined, since the Great Depression of the 1930s. One of the worst misuses of models is to look at history to determine the worst that has been seen and concluded that it is the worst that can be. The problem is that the historical scenario may not be bad enough. We need to think about circumstances that have not occurred but are possible. Besides its use in jewelry, gold serves very few functions. For protection against inflation, you can always use iShares Barclays TIPS Bond (TIP), or as Warren Buffett does: investing in companies that have the ability to pass on price increases. With average forward P/E of 19 for major gold mining stocks, it might indicate Gold is overvalued. However, no one knows when and where the next shoe will drop. Even without a potential new round of stimuli, current level of U.S. borrowing indicates that the U.S. dollar may depreciate over the long term. Sooner or later inflation might come. If the world really does falls into the cliff, gold might prove a nice insurance. I allocate a few pentane of my portfolio in gold mining stocks, just for a peace of mind.

2010-02-12,"Bernanke, Geithner, and Mr. Market All Say Buy Gold Now (GLD, GDX)","The correction in gold prices has clearly unnerved many of the newly-minted gold bugs. The simple fact gold is not going up $20 a day has sent the “hot money” running for the exits. Investors willing to wait out the passing storms and keep their eyes on the big prize, however, are going to do exceptionally well. In fact, this correction is likely creating another great opportunity to reload on your favorite gold stocks. It’s not just me who’s seeing opportunity in gold stocks now. Secretary Geithner, Chairman Bernanke, and Mr. Market have all recently signaled now is the time to buy gold stocks. Secretary Geithner: Words that will live in infamy Over the weekend on ABC’s Sunday political show This Week, the Treasury Secretary took to the airwaves once again with plenty of focus-grouped phrases to attempt to help create the image of how much worse the economy would be without the stimulus, bailouts, etc. It didn’t take long for Geithner to get off script though. Nearly halfway through the interview he started looking ahead into the future and making some bold guarantees. The following exchange reveals a lot of how the current administration views the massive and growing fiscal deficits and its ability to continue issuing bonds: Jake Tapper: Is the United States going to lose its triple-A government bond rating? And what happens when the credit markets are no longer willing to buy U.S. debt? Secretary Geithner: Absolutely not. And that will never happen to this country… If history is any evidence, when a government representative completely rules out something from happening, it’s pretty much a sure bet it’s only a matter of time until it does happen. That’s why when a reassuring Treasury Secretary says “absolutely not” and “never,” we know the dollar’s fate is pretty much sealed. Of course, Geithner isn’t alone. The Fed Chairman continues to see the green light to keep to the printing presses running at full speed. Chairman Bernanke: The only indicator that matters As we’ve discussed before in Is The Free Money Party Over?, GDP growth, unemployment, and other bits of the financial news media’s “top noise” simply don’t matter too much to the Fed Chairman. The key economic indicator Bernanke is watching is consumer credit. After all, the economic theory du jour finds deflation as the creation of all economic ills. And simply preventing deflation by any means necessary can prevent a depression and will lead to prosperity and growth. Despite how many things are wrong with that rationale, we know that means consumer credit growth is what will signal when the Fed starts hiking rates. Right now, consumer credit is still contracting. Last week the Fed reported consumer credit for the 11th straight month. Consumers cut their debt loads by $1.8 billion in December. That’s a sharp drop from the $21 billion in November, but since it still signals a decline in consumer spending, it’s a green light for the Fed to keep fighting deflation handing out free money. Mr. Market: Gold stock timing Indicator says “buy” Bernanke and Geithner are signaling good news for gold is ahead, but it’s Mr. Market who is once again signaling now is the time to get back into gold stocks specifically. In fact, the market is saying this is the best time to buy gold stocks since the markets are still jumping off their lows last spring. The chart below shows the how many shares of Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) an ounce of gold will buy over the past three years: -> Read more."
2010-02-16,The Only Chart That Matters,"Source: http://inthemoneystocks.com/n_rant_and_rave_blog.php Every trader and investor is talking about a correction or a small pullback in the market. Since the January top in the major indexes the markets have pulled back about 8 percent into the February 5th low. Now many traders and investors are saying the lows are in and the bull run from March 2009 is about to resume. While it is unknown who will be right or wrong one thing looks certain; the move of the market is directly inverse to the move in the U.S. Dollar. The U.S. Dollar can be tracked or traded to the long side by using the popular Powershares DB US Dollar Index (NYSEUUP). For traders that are looking to track or play the decline of the the dollar can use the opposite ETF called the Powershares DB US Dollar Index Bearish (NYSE: UDN). In late January we pointed out that the U.S. Dollar would hit a strong resistance level on the charts shortly. For those that happened to look at a UUP chart would have noticed that price traded into the weekly 50 moving average. After a long period of trading below this level the initial move into this strong moving average would be important and it has served as a wall of resistance for the dollar to climb. While many traders and investors in the media will point out countless reasons and stories for the market to move in a particular direction it is really all about the dollar. When the dollar declines, everything inflationary catches a bid. Just look at the rally in the market in March 2009; this bull run was on the back of the declining dollar plain and simple. For example, one can look at the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) today and see that the GLD is trading higher by 2.40 to 109.45 as the dollar declines. The U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) is trading higher 1.38 to 37.69 as the dollar retreats. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF) which produces iron ore is another commodity stock that is benefiting from the declining dollar. Everything that is commodity related is catching a strong bid on the falling dollar. When the dollar declines watch the commodity and inflationary stocks. There is a good chance they will be moving higher when the dollar is declining. However, on the flip side when the dollar moves higher traders should be aware that commodity and inflationary stocks will decline. Just look at the decline in the Market Vectors- Gold miners (NYSE: GDX) from early December into February 5th, 2010.This proves that the market depends on a declining dollar in order to move higher.

2010-02-19,"Strong Dollar Weakens Gold, And Crude Oil Prices (GDX, GLD, SCO, DBO)","The Federal Reserve’s decision to increase its discount rate, the first time in three years, has resulted in the strengthening of the dollar, and a decline in gold, and crude oil prices. Gold price, which has an inverse relationship with the dollar, fell 0.8% to $1,099.41 an ounce. Gold for April delivery fell by 1.7%. According to a Bloomberg survey, 50% of traders, investors, and analysts believe that gold prices would fall next week, 25% expect higher prices, and 25% are neutral. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) is trading at $109.61, while the Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF) (NYSE: GDX) is trading at $44.85. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF has a 52 week range of $84.92-$119.54, while the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF has a 52 week range of $29.95-$55.40. The strengthening of the dollar also resulted in a decline in crude oil prices by more than a dollar to $78 a barrel. However, some analysts believe that the decline in oil prices may be short lived due to volatile financial markets. By the book, the increase in the discount rate and the message it sends about a process begun is bearish for equities and commodities and bullish for the dollar, said Peter Beutel, president of Cameron Hanover. The PowerShares DB Oil Fund (ETF) (NYSE: DBO) is currently trading at $27.11, while the ProShares Ultra Short DJ-UBS Crude Oil (ETF) is currently trading at $13.42. The Powershares DB Oil Fund ETF has a 52 week range of $15.75-$28.86, while the Proshares Ultra Short DJ-UBS Crude Oil ETF has a 52 week range of $12.25-$59.76."
2010-02-19,Peter Schiff Likes Gold ,"Peter Schiff said on CNBC's Fast Money that he expects gold to go much higher. He added that you can look at gold chart in any currency, and you'll see that gold is looking good. Mr. Schiff believes that investors are afraid of inflation and that makes them buy gold. Peter Schiff is also bullish on gold miners. Guy Adami commented that he is also bullish on gold, but not nearly as much as Peter Schiff.

2010-03-01,"The El Dorado; Barron’s (GLD, GDX)","According to a Barron’s report, gold has been the safest bet in the recent past for investors, even safer than the US dollar. The report is based on a study by GoldMine.com, a facilitator of cross border transactions, which allows gold to be used as a currency. The study has found that in the period between 2000, and 2009, gold has risen by an average of 10.1% compared to the Swiss franc, and 14.9% compared to the dollar. Gold reached a peak of $1,220 per ounce on December 3, 2009. According to James Turk, founder of GoldMoney.com, the purchasing power of gold remains unchanged against commodities but the purchasing power of currencies has been eroding constantly. Turk believes that this is the reason for the gold’s strength against currencies. So is the search for the El Dorado over for investors? Well, the opinion is mixed on this one. The best way for retail investors to gain exposure to gold is through ETFs. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), and the Market Vectors Gold Miners (ETF) (NYSE: GDX) are two of the options available. The closing price on Friday for the SPDR Gold Trust ETF was $109.43, while that for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF was $43.89."
2010-03-03,"Gold Rises As Euro Gains Against the Dollar (GLD, GDX) ","Gold futures rose Wednesday but came off earlier highs, as the euro's gains against the dollar made the precious metal a more attractive investment alternative.

The SPDR Gold Trust ETF has a 52-week range of $84.92-$119.54, while the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF has a 52-week range of $29.25-$55.40. Alongside the currently robust jewelry demand from India and the high interest of speculative financial investors, ETF demand could also support the gold price in holding up against the firm U.S. dollar and in advancing toward the $1,200 an ounce mark, said analysts at Commerzbank. Gold has gained nearly 4% so far this year."

2010-03-18,Is The SPDR Gold ETF The Reason Behind The Massive Rally In Gold?,"“Clusterstock’s Chart of the Day makes the case that gold ETFs like the massive SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) have helped push prices higher in recent years by letting speculators bet on the precious metal. This “trigger-finger investor base” could exacerbate a crash when the momentum fades, the argument goes,” John Spence Reports From MarketWatch. Spence goes on to say, “With more than $40 billion in assets, GLD is the second-largest U.S.-listed ETF behind SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Huge inflows and the rise in gold prices have resulted in the fund’s assets more than doubling from $18 billion in September 2008, according to J.P. Morgan. The ETF holds more gold than many sovereign nations have stashed in their reserves.” “ETFs have allowed speculative buyers to rapidly move in and out of the asset, which has changed the nature of the investor base driving the metal’s marginal price,” Business Insider writes. “See, the gold buyers of the past didn’t have the hair-trigger trading capability of the present ETF group, and there was a time when gold was considered simply a store of value rather than a vehicle for making huge upside,” it adds. “Which is why some research firms have voiced concern about gold’s suspected dependency on fund flows for price support.” We have listed some options for investing in gold through ETFs below: LONG: The investment (GLD) seeks to replicate the performance, net of expenses, of the price of gold bullion. The trust holds gold, and is expected to issue baskets in exchange for deposits of gold, and to distribute gold in connection with redemption of baskets. The gold held by the trust will only be sold on an as-needed basis to pay trust expenses, in the event the trust terminates and liquidates its assets, or as otherwise required by law or regulation. The investment (GDX) seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the AMEX Gold Miners index. The fund generally normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in common stocks and American depositary receipts (ADRs) of companies involved in the gold mining industry. The fund is nondiversified. The Funds (GDXJ) investment objective is to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners Index (the “Junior Gold Miners Index”). For a further description of the Junior Gold Miners Index, see “Junior Gold Miners Index.” The objective of (SGOL) the newly listed shares is to reflect the performance of the price of Gold bullion, less the Trust’s operating expenses. The Trust is open ended and is designed for investors who want a cost-effective(1) and convenient(2) way to invest in Gold as well as diversify their Gold holdings. The investment (UGL) will seek to replicate, net of expenses, twice the performance of gold bullion as measured by the U.S. Dollar p.m. fixing price for delivery in London. The fund normally invests assets in financial instruments with economic characteristics twice the return of the index. It may employ leveraged investment techniques in seeking its investment objective. The investment (DGL) seeks to track the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is a rules-based index composed of futures contracts on gold and is intended to reflect the performance of gold. The investment (DGP) seeks to replicate, net of expenses, twice the daily performance of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is intended to reflect changes in the market value of certain gold futures contracts and is comprised of a single unfunded gold futures contract. The objective (IAU) of the trust is for the value of its shares to reflect, at any given time, the price of gold owned by the trust at that time, less the trust’s expenses and liabilities. The trust is not actively managed. It receives gold deposited with it in exchange for the creation of baskets of iShares, sells gold as necessary to cover the trust’s liabilities, and delivers gold in exchange for baskets of iShares surrendered to it for redemption. The trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. SHORT: The investment (DZZ) seeks to replicate, net of expenses, twice the inverse of the daily performance of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is intended to reflect changes in the market value of certain gold futures contracts and is comprised of a single unfunded gold futures contract. The investment (GLL) will seek to replicate, net of expenses, twice the inverse daily performance of gold bullion as measured by the U.S. Dollar p.m. fixing price for delivery in London. The fund normally invests assets in financial instruments with economic characteristics inverse to the index. It may employ leveraged investment techniques in seeking its investment objective.

2010-03-19,PLTM and CU: New First Trust ETFs Not Physically Backed,"First Trust launched two new ETFs on March 12: First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (PLTM) and First Trust ISE Global Copper Index Fund (CU). Their names sound like they are commodity ETFs, and perhaps even physically-backed commodity ETFs. However, they are equity funds that invest in stocks. First Trust probably should have added “producers,” “miners,” or “equity” to the names to avoid confusion. First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (PLTM) is based on an equity index called the ISE Global Platinum Index, which is designed to track public companies active in platinum-group metals mining based on revenue analysis. Platinum group metals include platinum, palladium, osmium, iridium, ruthenium, and rhodium. PLTM holds 25 stocks. The largest are MMC Norilsk Nickel JSC ADR 7.9%, Johnson Matthey Plc 6.9%, Eastern Platinum Ltd. 6.8%, Aquarius Platinum Ltd. 6.8%, Lonmin Plc 6.6%, Impala Platinum Holdings Limited 6.5%, Anglo Platinum Limited 6.1%, and Stillwater Mining Company 6.0%. Top country exposure includes Canada 24.4%, South Africa 22.2%, United Kingdom 17.2%, Australia 15.6%, Russia 7.8%, and United States 6.1%. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.70%. Additional information can be found in the PLTM summary and other resources in the PLTM documentation list. First Trust ISE Global Copper Index Fund (CU) is based on an equity index called the ISE Global Copper Index, which is designed to track public companies active in the copper mining industry based on revenue derived from the sale of copper. CU holds 27 stocks, the largest being BHP Billiton Ltd 6.8%, Xstrata Plc 6.8%, Antofagasta Plc 6.7%, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc. (Class B) 6.5%, Southern Copper Corporation 6.2%, and MMC Norilsk Nickel JSC ADR 5.0%. Top country exposure includes Canada 42.3%, United Kingdom 27.1%, United States 13.0%, Australia 6.8%, Russia 5.0%, and Peru 3.0%. Although Chile produces about a third of the world’s copper, its major players are not publicly traded. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.70%, and additional information can be found in the CU summary and other resources in the CU documentation list. With the introduction of PLTM and CU, investors now have the ability to invest in platinum and copper producers in much the way that Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) provide access to gold producers. Whether or not there is investor demand for indexed products covering non-gold metal-specific mining companies remains to be seen.

2010-03-22,Increased Global Demand Will Support The Price Of Gold ETFs,"“Gold prices over the past week have been teetering in positive, negative and somewhat uncertain territory. But there is confidence that the price of bullion will increase this year. One factor that is likely to support the price of the precious metal is the fact that central banks around the world have been hoarding the commodity and are reluctant to sell it. In fact, some bullion analysts expect the central banks of China, Russia and India to continue to gobble up gold as they move away from sovereign bonds and seek safer investments,” Kevin Grewal Reports From The Street. Grewal goes on to say, “A second factor likely to support the price of the yellow metal is the expected increase in global demand for base metals. There is an indirect correlation between the two types of metals, and in general as the prices of base metals increase so do those of gold. Thirdly, investor appetite for safe-haven tools is expected to continue to rise as sovereign debt issues in Europe, particularly Greece, continue to make headlines and remain a concern.” “Lastly, the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates at or near zero is likely to result in a loss of purchasing power, which could result in the U.S. dollar declining and make gold appealing to foreign investors and painting a macroeconomic backdrop which may support gold’s price,” Grewal Reports. We put together a list of some Gold ETFs to play if you believe in Golds increased global demand below: LONG: The investment (GLD) seeks to replicate the performance, net of expenses, of the price of gold bullion. The trust holds gold, and is expected to issue baskets in exchange for deposits of gold, and to distribute gold in connection with redemption of baskets.

2010-03-25,Does Investing In The Platinum ETF Make More Sense Than A Gold ETF?,"“Gold might have history on its side, but when it comes to investing in precious metals platinum arguably makes more sense. Platinum is rarer, dearer and just as pretty. What’s more, unlike gold, it has an important industrial use in automotive catalytic converters and LCD TV screens. If that weren’t enough to recommend the white metal, the launch of new exchange-traded funds makes platinum easier than ever to buy and sell,” Christopher Helman Reports From Forbes. Helman goes on to say, “How does platinum compare to gold as an investment? It tends to trail its yellow sister when times are bad but outperform when industrial demand recovers. That’s been the case in the past three months, as platinum prices have outpaced gold’s by roughly 10 percentage points. These days, an ounce of platinum at $1,600 buys roughly 1.4 ounces of gold. That’s more than the average of 1.2 ounces last year, according to Bloomberg. Back in May 2008, an ounce of platinum bought 2.4 ounces of gold” “The ETF Securities Physical Platinum Shares (PPLT) fund is similar to the popular gold bullion SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) in that it buys and holds raw bullion (safeguarded by JP Morgan Chase (JPM)). Its shares track platinum’s spot price. You’ll incur lower transaction and storage fees in holding the ETF (annual expenses: 0.6%) than in holding and storing your own bullion bars,” Helman Reports.

2010-03-26,Further Political Disruptions Around The World Will Push Gold ETF Prices Higher,"“One of my favorite areas to invest in to protect my profits and reduce my portfolio risk is an ETF that invests in gold. SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) has advanced 150% during the past five years compared to an advance of just 1% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. And during the ugly bear market from October 9, 2007, until March 9, 2009, GLD was up 23.9% compared to the -56.8% drubbing that the S&P 500 took,” Roy Ward Reports From The Iconoclast Investor. Ward goes on to say, “Gold Shares provide investors with a convenient way to invest in gold. The shares trade on the NYSE and may be bought and sold like any other securities. I believe further political disruptions around the world will push gold prices higher in 2010 and 2011. Also, inflation will likely begin to rise within the next 12 months, which will also push gold prices higher. If the economy falters once again, investors will sell common stocks and invest in gold.” “Gold bullion increased from a low of 800 to almost 1,200 per ounce during 2009, but has now declined to 1,107 per ounce. The resulting lower price of GLD shares presents an outstanding investment opportunity. The purchase of (GLD) will counteract the volatility of common stocks and will guard against a possible fall in bond prices,” Ward Reports.

2010-03-28,"ETF Investors Will Look To Buy Gold And Tech As The Next Market Correction Nears (GLD, QQQQ, SPY, GDX)","I’m going to start off with a few breadth charts. The NYSE new highs – new lows chart is now on a sell signal as both the slow and fast average have rolled over and are accelerating downward. Everything continues to point to an impending correction. The change in character the last two days is also suggestive that something is different. Instead of opening lower and rising through the day, the market has been gapping up but closing lower. This is a complete about face from what has been happening over the last two months. I will be monitoring sentiment as the market moves down into the correction. If investors get scared and panic quickly then this should be a short correction. If we were to get a sharp selloff this is what I would expect to happen. I’m talking 50+ S&P 500 points in 3 or 4 days. If, however, investors have gotten locked into a buy the dip mentality it could slow the rate of decline and we might be looking at something lasting closer to 10 or more days. I will say that what usually happens after one of these extreme momentum moves is that everyone heads for the door at the same time. The correction tends to be scary but over quickly as everyone panics all at once. That’s what happened in February 2007 during the mini crash following the runaway move. The market gave back four months of gains in 8 days. Now I don’t think we are going to give back 4 months of gains (this is only a daily cycle low not an intermediate cycle low), but I do think we could quickly fill the March 5th gap, which would be a 60 point loss. If that happened in 5 or 6 days it should be enough to swing the bullish sentiment all the way back to the extreme negative side of the boat. The market desperately needs to reset sentiment by going through another mini profit taking period and the sharper the correction, the better. I’ve warned many times that the intermediate correction separating the second and third leg of the bull was only going to be a profit taking correction that would soon be recovered. However, and as expected, while we were going through the last correction I had multiple traders inform me that this was the onset of another deflationary collapse. Heck, I’m still seeing articles on the internet predicting another deflationary collapse any day now. Often these predictions of disaster are associated with some imaginary trend line dating back to the 1970’s or 1980’s. I’ve even seen one site that based their predictions of an impending bear market on a trend line originating in the 30’s. I have to ask, how many people from the 1930’s are still trading stocks and are there enough of them to really effect the markets? I have no earthly idea why a trend line starting back in the depression should have any significance at all to today’s market. Geez, some of the crazy stuff one sees in this business. It’s enough to make you wonder if common sense is dead. I must say after watching both the tech and real estate bubbles expand and listening to the irrational reasons analysts gave at the time for why they weren’t bubbles, I have to think common sense is becoming a rare commodity in this day and age. I’m going to let you in on a secret. Bull markets don’t end because of lines on a chart or Fibonacci retracements or anything technical related for that matter. Bull markets end when a fundamental shift occurs. They end when something breaks. In a secular bear market like we have been in since 2000 that fundamental shift almost invariably leads to a severe bear leg down in stocks and the onset of a recession…or worse. We saw the first leg of the secular bear begin in 2000 as the world realized tech stocks were ridiculously overpriced, along with Greenspan’s monetary policies spiking the price of oil. The end result was a severe bear market and a recession. We saw this again more recently as the credit and real estate bubbles burst. This was then exacerbated by Bernanke’s insane monetary response which, of course, did nothing to stop either one of those bubbles from bursting. All Bernanke’s monetary response did was spike the price of oil to $150 and made sure we would have a very severe recession. This is still a cyclical bull though and until we have a catalyst in place to kill it there is one game plan that should be followed. That game plan is one that everyone who has the slightest experience in the market should already know. In bull markets you BUY DIPs. And you continue buying dips until you see a fundamental change occur that is going to send us down into the next recession. So once we enter the correction (it may have started with last Thursday’s key reversal) we want to be buyers of that dip. (I’m going to outline a game plan in a minute). First off, let me state again that I seriously doubt the next leg down in the secular bear is going to come from a deflationary front. We’ve already gone down that road. Bernanke proved he can defeat deflation with his printing press. Heck, he proved he could abort a left translated four year cycle with the power of the printing press. I’m constantly getting into debates with traders pushing the deflation scenario. The fact remains that we had the worst deflationary period in 80 years and Bernanke halted it in 9 months. Bernanke halted deflation the same way Roosevelt halted deflation in the 30’s by debasing the currency. I can assure you that if the slightest hint of deflation reappears, Ben will crank up the presses again. So I just don’t see deflation as the catalyst for the end of this cyclical bull. The catalyst for the death of any bull market almost always comes from the area that is experiencing excesses. In 2000 the catalyst emerged when the tech sector cracked. Everyone had become convinced these companies were eventually going to make unimaginable amounts of money, while amazingly enough overlooking the fact that most of them were making no money and never really had any reasonable shot at ever making any money. They were just burning through capital and at an incredible rate. Once the world woke up and realized the emperor had no clothes, down we went. This collapse was exacerbated by Greenspan’s printing efforts to ward of the imagined 2000 contagion and had the unintended consequence of spiking the price of oil. The latest catalyst as I mentioned above came when the overheated real estate and credit markets imploded. So we have to ask ourselves, where is the excess this time? It certainly isn’t tech. The companies that are left are making money. It’s not the real estate markets. That bubble has already popped. And I don’t believe it is going to pop again. I doubt it’s going to come from the credit markets again, as people and banks are deleveraging now, and for years to come. Besides central banks have already figured out they can fix those problems by changing the accounting laws and by pumping liquidity. So where is the dam going to spring a leak from this time? What is the area that is experiencing massive excesses that will eventually come back to haunt us? I would say there are two. One of them is government debt. But I’m not sure that will cause problems though because governments control the printing presses. No matter how much debt they rack up they can always print enough additional money to pay it. That leads us to the heart of where I think the next catalyst is going to emerge. The one area of incredible excess is the currency markets. Let’s face it, every country in the world has been running the presses on overdrive since early 2008. This has created an ocean of liquidity covering the globe like no other time in history. It halted the deflationary spiral we were in last year. And it is certainly giving the illusion that good times are returning (heavy emphasis on illusion). But just like the credit bubble felt real nice while it was growing, there are going to be consequences for this excessive liquidity. The piper will eventually have to be paid. I expect it will start when a small or maybe even a medium sized country’s currency gets into trouble. Then, just as subprime infected the rest of the mortgage market, it will spread into other currencies. I strongly suspect the bull market will end when something breaks in the currency markets. So until we see that happen investors should continue to buy dips and ignore all the Chicken Little’s predicting the sky is falling because we are approaching a trend line from 1932 or because this is the third of a third wave or whatever hokey nonsense they imagine will start the next bear phase. As I have said, bear markets begin when the fundamentals break down, not when the technicals do. The Game Plan: Now with that in mind, and allowing that nothing in the currency markets has broken …yet, we need to plan for how we should proceed. At the moment traders should be mostly in cash as we await the correction into the daily cycle low. Once we get the inevitable correction we have a couple of options. One, we can invest heavily back into the miners on the assumption that gold’s A-wave has started. That will certainly be an option, but one with a very big condition attached to it. Gold must break below the February low. If gold doesn’t break below the February low of $1044 I think that option will come off the table. The reason being that the intermediate gold cycle is going to be short as we go into this stock market correction. Usually this cycle will last about 20-25 weeks. If the cycle bottoms next week or the week after that it would put the intermediate cycle at 14/15 weeks. Now it’s not unusual for gold to have a short cycle from time to time but if gold hasn’t made a lower low then we will be facing the distinct possibility that we are going to get another bounce that fails to make a higher high followed by a final move to lower lows that bottoms in the normal timing band. The other possibility would be that February did mark the D-wave bottom and gold is now in a very tricky A-wave advance. This is a possibility but one that is going to be very difficult to game as we won’t really have confirmation unless gold breaks above $1161. And by that time the rally will probably be mostly over as A-waves rarely make new highs. So while I know gold bugs will jump on a higher low as proof gold has bottomed, cyclically it would be much better if gold makes a lower low as that would have much higher odds of marking a true intermediate cycle low and probably the end of the D-wave. It would also be a huge plus if the COT report shows a 90+ Blees rating. (The Blees rating is simply a measure of how bullish or bearish commercial traders are compared to the last 18 months and available to subscribers in the weekend reports). That’s not going to happen with gold above $1050. The next thing I want to call attention to is Bernanke’s goal. It has always been his intent to inflate asset prices. And he’s certainly succeeded so far. Now let me state clearly that I’m not a believer in the whole gold manipulation conspiracy theory nonsense. If gold were really being manipulated successfully then explain to me how in the world it’s managed to rise from $250 to over $1200 an ounce. What I will concede is that the powers that be would probably prefer that gold didn’t rise. $1200 gold kind of makes a mockery of their phony CPI and PPI numbers. Now that doesn’t mean they can do anything about rising gold. A secular bull market is a secular bull market and nothing anyone does is going to stop that from running its course. What it does mean is that they are certainly not going to do anything to expedite the process. What the powers that be do want is for the stock market to rise. So I think we have to admit that if there is anything the government can do to help that process along they will, or at the very minimum they will certainly not do anything to hinder that from occurring. So the second investment option when we get close to the bottom of the impending daily cycle would be to just buy the market (probably tech as it’s been outperforming and will likely continue to do so). If the government wants the market going up then the lowest risk play would be to just take them at their word and go along for the ride. Buying the QQQQ’s (QQQQ) or the SPYDER’s (SPY) would be, by far, the safest play if gold has not made a lower low and even if gold has made a new low it would still be the safest bet, although probably not the most profitable as an A-wave advance in gold should send mining stocks rocketing higher and would likely double the percentage gains possible in the CUBE’s or SPYDER’s. So I will be watching gold as we move down into the stock market cycle low. If gold does not make a lower low like we want, then I think we are going to have to assume that we are going to see another failed rally that is unable to break the pattern of lower highs and that will roll over again. Any positions taken in miners or metals at that point will have to be short term positions. That doesn’t mean those positions won’t rally. Many could rally 15 -20% which would probably be bigger than the stock market but we would have to go into those positions knowing we will be exiting again soon and that the odds are that this is just another deceptive bounce in an ongoing D-wave and not the explosive move of an A-wave rally. If gold does fail to make a lower low I think the safer bet would be just to buy the market. -Written By Toby Connor From Gold Scents Gold Scents is focused primarily on the secular gold bull market.

2010-03-31,Investor Demand Shifts From Gold To Platinum ETFs,"Don Dion, thestreet.com, produced a video today diving into why it may be time for you to move some of your gold holdings to platinum. Since gold does not serve any real industrial demand, it is a great way to protect portfolios during times of market contraction. Don still see’s gold as a good investment due to currency risks, however with the market expanding, more industrial precious metals may perform better. Don states that, “Platinum, unlike gold, serves industrial purposes and is becoming more essential each day. Demand forecasts for the metal look strong given its use in the production of household items such as LCD televisions, as well as its use in the production of catalytic converters for automobiles.” The increasing demand for industrial metals is bidding up the prices for the metal higher, making them more desireable to those seeking higher rates of return.

2010-04-05,"Gold ETF News: After 30% Gain in Past Year, Where Next for Gold?","Jeffrey Nichols, Senior Economic Advisor to Rosland Capital, had the following commentary based on today’s market activity and the week ahead.From its recent low under $1,090 an ounce, gold has recovered lost ground, trading above $1,120 in past days. And while gold prices have appreciated nearly 30 percent from a year ago, gold remains below its all-time high of $1,227 reached in early December. The question of “Where next?” may rest in the following factors: The Euro: Will the Euro regain its lost favor, or will sovereign risk considerations push the European currency still lower against the U.S. dollar? In the recent past, capital flight and currency speculation gave the dollar a boost, and the “appearance” of a stronger dollar has been gold’s chief nemesis ever since Europe’s sovereign risk crisis moved to center stage. Greece’s announced “bail-out” plan in March eased sovereign-risk fears and gave gold some room to recover. But Europe’s currency crisis is far from over. Credit default markets are again signaling rising anxiety, not only over Greek debt but also over the sovereign debt of Portugal, Spain and Italy. In the near term, another run on the Euro could send gold lower. Federal debt: Rising anxiety over America’s huge federal debt (as evidenced by the mixed reception by foreign central banks and institutional investors to U.S. Treasury debt offerings in the past couple of months) is undermining faith in the U.S. dollar and calling into question its future purchasing power. As concerns about the dollar mount, as central banks and foreign investors demand a rising risk premium on U.S. Treasury debt offerings, the effect of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and uncertainty about the future viability of the continent’s common currency will have a diminishing effect on the dollar – and gold will be free to reflect its inherent value. Global demand: Will strong physical demand from China, India, and other important Asian gold markets continue to underpin the price, set an effective floor beneath the market, and limit downside risks? Physical demand from this region, particularly India and the Middle East, tends to be extremely price sensitive. In recent weeks, however, particularly as gold dipped toward $1,090 an ounce, increased buying from the region (China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Arabian Gulf states), provided strong support and helped push the price back above $1,100. Significant and substantial growth in gold demand from this region pushed by a range of factors will have a very positive effect on the dollar price of gold – something Western investors have come to anticipate. Western investment: Investors are returning to gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after several months of lackluster interest. Bullion held on behalf of the 12 gold ETFs we monitor, rose by 929,373 ounces in March, recording the first monthly gain since last November. In contrast, gold ETFs saw net sales of 825,501 ounces in the first two months of this year. In addition, demand for gold bullion coins has also picked up in recent weeks, indicating that interest in gold from individual “retail” investors is also perking up. As all of these developments coalesce positively for gold, we are still confident in our forecast of $1,500 gold by the end of 2010.

As a result, the yellow metal has hit its highest level since December 3. Gold futures for June delivery added as much as $20.70, or 1.72%, to $1,221.50 an ounce by 10:24 am. Analyst Daniel Major of RBS Global Banking & Markets said, “Investors are trying to search out safe havens, and clearly gold is one of those. While the current environment of acute investor risk aversion remains, gold is bound to benefit. On Monday, the higher risk assets such as the euro, stocks and industrial commodities witnessed a relief rally, while gold slipped 2%, only to make a comeback today while the rally in other assets fizzled out. According to Steve Chun, a trader with Hyundai Futures Company in Seoul, “Gold remains in favor as investors haven’t regained full confidence that Greece and debt-ridden countries will survive with the package. China’s higher inflation is also adding to alternative demand for gold.” Some of the gold ETFs that are on the move today are SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), which is up 1.60%, iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), which has moved up 1.73%, and Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which has jumped 5.72%.

2010-05-12,Gold Hits Record High,"Gold prices rocketed to a new record high of $1,231.40/oz. on Tuesday. Investors around the world had hoped that last weekend's near-trillion-dollar rescue package of loans and bond purchases by European and American taxpayers would bail out riot-torn Greece and end fears of the euro losing value or collapsing, but by Tuesday these hopes were evaporating. This gargantuan bailout, according to the International Monetary Fund's Director for Europe, Mark Belka, is nothing but morphine to stabilize the patient. This bailout, warned Belka, cures none of the underlying problems caused by Greece and other profligate nations' reckless borrowing and spending. Some ETF's of interest that moved on the news are SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), up 0.33%, and Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), up 0.35%."
2010-05-12,Another Way To Play Gold's Ascent,"Fueled by Europe's sovereign debt woes and plunging oil prices, gold has been making fresh 2010 highs, but you probably knew that already. And you probably already knew that popular ETFs like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (NYSE: SGOL) have been making new highs as well. GLD and SGOL are backed by physical gold and that means each of their shares represent ownership in an ounce gold, usually each share equals roughly a tenth of an ounce. That means these ETFs trade with triple digit price tags and those prices can intimidate plenty of investors. Don't worry, there is another way to play rising gold prices and that is the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the small-cap cousin of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). GDXJ made its debut just seven months ago, but has accumulated almost $116 million in assets in that time. The allure of GDXJ lies in the fact every now and then, a small-cap gold mining firm really does make it big. The problem is picking the right one from the herd of small-cap miners that are here today and gone tomorrow. GDXJ focuses on companies with a median market cap of $850 million, so the ETF stays aways from the speculative names without eschewing growth potential. Actually, almost 44% of GDXJ's constituents qualify as mid-cap stocks, but what should be noted is that there the intimate correlation between GDXJ and GLD or GDX that one might expect. GDX is up about 7% in the past six months, while GLD is up 10%. GDXJ trumps both, as it is up 20% since its debut. If $30 emerges as support for GDXJ that may confirm the ETF's breakout and $35 may not be far off.

2010-05-13,Tapping Into Other Miners,"Investors have been flocking to gold miner exchange traded funds such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) as way to diversify their portfolios and protect themselves from upcoming inflationary pressures. Investing in mining companies rather than physical bullion holds certain advantages for some investors and funds like the GDX have become immensely popular as a way to exploit the volatility and leverage associated with such firms. Recently, several ETF sponsors have created a number of new miner funds that expand the choices available for commodity exposure. These include metals such as silver, copper and platinum. These funds should continue to grow as the world demand for commodities increases. The First Trust ISE Global Copper (NYSE: CU) follows a basket of 27 different miners that are active in the copper mining industry based on analysis of revenue derived from the sale of copper. The fund charges 0.70% in expenses. The First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index (NASDAQ: PLTM) follows 25 companies focused on platinum metals group which includes platinum, palladium, osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium. The fund also charges 0.70% in expenses. Investing in the poor-mans gold, the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) holds 25 silver producers and charges 0.65%. While new, the fund has already attracted a decent asset base and trading volume. Learn how to find the best stocks to trade each day in our 70 page E-Book and 90 minute online video for free."
2010-05-19,Mike Khouw Recommends An Option Strategy In GDX,"Mike Khouw said on CNBC's Fast Money that he is not a big fan of gold. He recommends investors buy a put spread in Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Mr. Khouw wants to buy June 50 put for $2.85 and sell June 45 put for $0.95. This trade would cost him $1.90, and it makes the most money at $45. It loses money above $48.10. GDX is highly correlated to gold, and if gold goes down GDX will go down too. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) fell 3.96% today and closed at $49.45."
2010-05-20,A Small-Cap ETF – A Big Idea for Gold Bugs (GDXJ),"The fallout from plunging oil prices and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis has given investors few places to hide. Two asset classes are on the upswing lately: the U.S. Dollar and Gold. Both are seen as safe havens. Yes, they’re bouncing around a lot and are due for a correction. The current pullback could be a good buying opportunity. Today we’ll focus on gold-related investments. Thanks to ETFs, you can participate in gold’s rally without actually owning gold. You’ve probably heard of the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). GLD is backed by physical gold holdings and has become the world’s second-largest ETF by assets, thanks to rising gold prices and huge cash inflows. Several smaller ETFs are also backed by physical gold. There are other ETFs to help investors play positive gold trends that are not reliant on actual gold holdings. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) is the small-cap cousin to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). The latter focuses on large-cap names. GDXJ is a small-cap ETF that has proven popular with investors since its debut in November 2009, accumulating almost $116 million in assets. That’s an impressive haul in such short time. Some investors still view small-cap gold names in a negative light. This is probably due to those promotional pieces we get by email from unscrupulous hucksters extolling a small-cap miner with no chance of survival, let alone turning a profit. Those are NOT the stocks GDXJ owns. While not huge, New Gold (NGD), Gammon Gold (GRS), Coeur d’Alene Mines (CDE), and other holdings are real companies that are in the business to stay. About 54% of GDXJ’s holdings are considered “small-cap” using the metric of a market cap of $200 million to $1 billion. The ETF balances this with 44% in mid-cap names (stocks with market caps of $1 billion to $5 billion). In addition, GDXJ’s country exposure should give investors some comfort. Nearly two-thirds of the assets are in Canadian companies. Australia and the U.S. also have double-digit allocations. To be sure, many of GDXJ’s holdings could be considered speculative. That’s what makes this ETF a good idea. Select small-cap gold miners can offer big-time rewards. The trick is to own the right names. GDXJ isn’t actively managed, but its index methodology seems to result in a pretty good selection. GDXJ has performed admirably so far in 2010, gaining about 10%, in line with GDX and GLD. GDXJ has outperformed its larger rivals since its debut last November. Of course, any gold-related ETF is sensitive to the daily price swings in the underlying commodity. Bear that in mind if you buy. Nevertheless, GDXJ may be a good alternative for some gold exposure. To go long small-cap and mid-gap gold producers, buy GDXJ. Disclosure covering writer, editor, publisher, and affiliates: Long GLD. No positions in any of the companies or ETF sponsors mentioned. No income, revenue, or other compensation (either directly or indirectly) received from, or on behalf of, any of the companies or ETF sponsors mentioned."

2010-05-31,Deutsche Bank Sees Gold At $1600 In 2012,"Michael Blumenroth, a precious metal trader at Deutsche Bank, said on CNBC that the price of gold will continue its bullish trend, and it will eventually peak at $1,600 in 2012. He explained that Deutsche Bank's research team was at first bearish on gold, because they thought that this bull market in gold will be over soon, but after the problems in the euro-zone they changed their opinion. Now, Deutsche Bank believes that gold will continue to be a safe heaven. Michael Blumenroth added that central banks are not selling gold in the European markets at the moment. The IMF will probably sell this precious metal, but the IMF would rather sell it to Asian central banks than sell it in the market. Michael Blumenroth doesn't recommend investors have more than 5%-10% of gold in their portfolio. If you are also bullish on gold and you see it as a safe heaven, one way to get exposure to gold is by buying SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD). You can also look at gold miners, or you can try with Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX)."
2010-06-01,Gold Miners ETF May Be Primed For Shorting,"The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) endured the May market sell-off trading flat on the month while the S&P 500 tumbled nearly 10%, but there are dents in the armor. The ETF's recent decline from resistance around $54.60 sent the ETF below its 50-day moving average and within earshot of the 200-day line as well, bearish signs. While the 50-day line has been reclaimed, it appears as though GDX is making a series of lower highs and lower lows. Consider that gold miners do not always move in unison with spot gold prices and that mining and material names have been weak to say the least lately and there is a solid foundation for a potential short in GDX. A violation of the $49.85 area may represent a decent short entry in GDX. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) account for about 28% of the ETF's weight and GDX has $6.4 billion in assets.

He added that gold keeps changing its character. In 2008, fear was the reason behind an uptrend in gold. Inflation worries have sent gold higher in 2009, and in 2010 sovereign debt worries are the reason for a spike in gold. Gold crossed $1,250, which is an important technical level, added Scott Redler, and that is why it is moving higher today. Scott Redler believes that the demand for gold will continue, and the price for this precious metal could reach $1,500 per ounce by the end of the year. If you agree with Scott Redler, you can take a look at SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) and Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Sprott Physical Gold Trust (NYSE: PHYS) is another way to trade gold."
2010-06-18,"Time To Buy Gold? Peter Schiff Thinks Gold Could Hit $5,000 (GLD, GDX, ABX, GOLD, PHYS)","Noted investor, author, and candidate for the U.S. Senate, Peter Schiff, granted Benzinga an exclusive interview earlier this week. Schiff, who is the president of Euro Pacific Capital, famously predicted the financial meltdown of 2008, and he says that there is more pain ahead. Talking about gold, Schiff told us I don't even look at gold as an investment...I would look at gold more the way that I would look at cash. It's liquid. It's a store of savings...I don't really view it as an alternative to stocks or bonds, it's an alternative to the Euro or the Dollar or the Japanese Yen, and from that perspective, it's an absolute winner...I think it's going over $5,000 an ounce. There are a number of different ways that investors can capitalize if gold prices continue to soar. The easiest way to gain exposure to the shiny metal is to purchase shares of the massive SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD), which hit a new all time high today. There have been some questions, however, about how much physical gold the GLD actually has in its possession. If you want to be 100% positive that your shares are backed up by physical gold stored in a vault, take a look at the Sprott Physical Gold Trust (NYSE: PHYS). Another way to participate in the gold boom is to invest in individual mining companies such as Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD). These stocks have appreciated 17.65% and 20% year-to-date, respectively. It is also possible to buy a basket of gold mining stocks through the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX).

2010-06-22,Two ETFs for Any Season,"Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) analysis from Wall Street Sector Selector With the last few years’ volatility and major indexes still below highs last seen more than ten years ago at the beginning of “The Tech Wreck,” many investors are wondering if there are any “safe harbors” or investments that can still generate a decent return on investment for the long term. While there’s no “sure thing,” one can look back over the last ten years and find various asset classes that have steadily outperformed the S&P 500 and might continue to do so in the future. In this article we’ll take a look at two of these and examine how they’ve fared and how and why they might continue to outperform in the future. All that Glitters is Gold I’m not a “gold bug” by any means, but a look back shows us that gold has been in a solid bull market since 2000 and has generated significant excess returns on investment over this period of time. chart courtesy of StockCharts.com In this chart of Gold versus the S&P 500 we can clearly see how GOX, the CBOE Gold Index has outperformed the S&P 500 since 2000. However, the last ten years have not been without periods of volatility and underperformance or volatility as outlined by the jagged red trace above as Gold logged +350% returns versus less than 0% for the S&P 500. Going forward, advocates of gold say that no matter what happens gold can’t miss. (Again, I caution against thinking that anything is a “sure thing.”) They say this because if all the recent money printing and deficit spending, not just in the U.S. but around the world, leads to inflation then gold will be a good hedge against rising prices. On the other end of the spectrum, if we’re heading for a global financial collapse under the weight of global debt and sovereign defaults, then gold will be the currency of last resort and a final store of value and so will also go up. Black Gold Glitters, Too The second asset class that has outperformed over the last ten years is energy and oil in particular. chart courtesy of StockCharts.com In this chart, we compare the price of the CBOE Oil Index to the S&P 500 since 2000. Again we see a similar pattern wherein Oil has generated gains of +150% versus less than 0% for the S&P 500. And again, we see that these gains have not come without significant volatility and setbacks along the way. Advocates of oil and energy say that prices can only go up as an ever growing energy hungry world vies for more and more of a declining resource. Energy and oil prices are directly tied to global demand but it’s easy to make an argument that with the industrialization of the emerging world that demand (and prices) have only one way to go and that is up. If you “buy in” to the rationale of the advocates of these two asset classes, then retail investors now have easier access to the gold and oil markets than ever before via exchange traded funds. The largest gold ETF is (GLD) the SPDR Gold Trust ETF, which buys physical gold and whose assets are larger than most countries, while another option for exposure to the gold market is via (GDX) Market Vectors Gold Miners, which tracks the AMEX Gold Miners Index of companies involved in gold mining activities. For advocates of the energy/oil market, the largest Exchange Traded Fund is (USO) United States Oil Fund, a commodity based ETF that tracks the price of West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil predominantly through the use of oil futures contracts. The novel element to all of these ETFs is that now investors can gain exposure to commodities markets via a stock-like vehicle that can be used in cash accounts, IRAs or even 401k accounts without having to venture into the ever dangerous and volatile futures markets. None of the above is meant to be a recommendation or investment advice and no one has a crystal ball or can predict the future and so there’s never a guarantee that these might turn out to be good investments over the long haul. However, if past performance is any indication of future performance, gold and oil/energy might be two good places to look for long term returns that could outperform traditional index investing.

ECONOMIC NEWS On the economic front, existing home sales for May were released on Tuesday. The National Association of Realtors said May sales dropped to an annual rate of 5.66 million, far below consensus expectations of 6.1 million. Home sales were down 22 percent from the September 2005 peak of 7.25 million. New home sales plunged 33 percent in May from April to the lowest level ever recorded, an annual rate of 300,000 according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Sales fell 18.3 percent compared to a year ago. Observers were expecting a 400,000 annualized sales forecast for May. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor released initial jobless claims. The result surprised analysts, falling 19,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 457,000 level. This was the lowest level in six weeks, beating expectations of 465,000 initial jobless claims. Also on Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department said orders for durable goods dropped in May, sinking 1.1 percent on weaker demand for airplanes, steel and communications equipment. This was viewed as mildly positive with consensus expectations for a 1.4 percent decline. EARNINGS On the earnings front, Adobe Systems (Nasdaq: ADBE) reported first quarter profits of 44 cents per share against a consensus estimate of 33 cents. Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) earned 60 cents per share, topping analyst estimates of 54 cents. KB Homes (NYSE: KBH) had disappointing news on Friday, posting a loss of 40 cents per share.

2010-06-29,"Dennis Gartman Explains The Action In Gold (GLD, GDX, GDXJ)","Dennis Gartman said on CNBC's Fast Money that he is bullish on gold. He explained that when stocks decline like they did today, investors start to look for liquidity. This is the reason why gold struggled to make significant gains today. Dennis Gartman added that it is possible for gold to trade higher in the deflationary environment. Gold traded higher in 1930s, and back then U.S. was facing deflation too. Mr. Gartman added that he is not a gold bug, but money has to go somewhere, and gold is a logical choice. He also said that the stock market can't go up when the government is raising tax and making spending cuts. Gold mining stocks are not the best way to own gold, because you don't want to worry about strikes and other troubles that could happen. That is why Dennis Gartman does not recommend Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). The best way to play gold is with SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), thinks Dennis Gartman. GDX and GDXJ fell 2.66% and 4.42% today, while GLD gained 0.15%. See Some of the Top Moving Indexes Here."

2010-07-01,Dollar Bull Still Has No Mo-Jo Ahead of June NFP report,"The dollar decline off the June 7 high paused on the Monday June 21 summer solstice. The dollar even double bottomed on Monday June 28, but the dollar never went back up. The dollar bull trade remains on pause until it is safely back above the 21 day average in green. Curiously enough gold double topped on Monday June 21 and Monday June 28 but its bull trend could not be derailed. I will have more to say on gold in a separate report. The trend in the dollar in 2009-2010 has been beautifully defined by the quarterly blue average, and a test of that average at 8463 may well be in store for the dollar on a crappy jobs report on Friday July 2. The dollar is weaker overnight and if it weakens further after the jobless claims report (assumedly still high) that will be a leading indication for it. Now, the dollar could recover intraday if the ISM report is strong, but that remains to be seen. 8433 is the daily low close after the May 6 stock mkt crash, I don’t expect a close below that level near term. In fact, I expect the bull trend to resume after a test of the quarterly average. The dollar topped on Monday June 2, it could well bottom on Tuesday July 6 say. Now, if the dollar gets whacked for another handle of downside on Friday’s lousy jobs report, gold might rally, no? It might take wing and fly into next Tuesday July 6. Technicals are still not confirming the gold rally, so the gold bull needs a rest. Look for the gold report to follow. Stocks to look at: SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX)"
2010-07-01,Gold’s Double Top in June 2010 Ain’t Working So Well,"There is an old maxim that double tops and double bottoms are meant to be taken out. While that is not always the case, it is a maxim to be cognizant of. Gold double topped on Monday June 28, 5 days after the Monday June 21 high. Yes, I figured gold would get whacked on Monday June 28 and it did. But trend did not reverse. A 33 day cycle low was due on Tuesday June 29, and gold promptly double bottomed on that low to low cycle at 1227. 1227 also happens to be the Dec 3 high. A change in trend will not be confirmed until gold takes out the 1227 double bottom and crosses below the 2009 yr high on a closing basis. Now, the chart above is very busy. Let’s break down the details. First there is a 33 day low to low cycle. It is active, and the next 33 day cycle low is Monday Aug 16 (day after Aug 13 retail sales). Now, please reference the Dec 3 2009 yr high. Gold topped on the third day of that month, one day before a NFP report. The Dec 3 high terminated the bull trend off the July 8 2009 low on the 106 day (35 x 3 – close to the active 33-34 day cycle). Tuesday July 6 will be 106 days from the Feb 5 2010 yr low. Tuesday July 7 will be the third day of the month, and one day following the July 2 NFP report. Tuesday July 6 will also be 5 days from the high of Monday June 28 and the high of June 28 was five days after the June 21 high. Tuesday July 6 will be 10 days after the June 21 high. The June 21 high came 9 days after the June 8 high. A preliminary three little Indian price target is 1277-1278 for Tuesday July 6. I am not a big fan of this pattern as it is highly unreliable, but we got to start somewhere. I will sharpen my pencil after the NFP report.

Following gold's tumble on Thursday, keep an eye on the UltraShort Gold ProShares (NYSE: GLL). The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) was down 4.5% on Thursday. The Claymore/MAC Global Solar Energy ETF (NYSE: TAN) was up almost 3% on Thursday. For some reason, the iShares MSCI Spain Index (NYSE: EWP) was up almost 5% on Thursday.

2010-07-19,"Dennis Gartman: I Was Wrong On Gold (GLD, UGL, GDX)","Dennis Gartman said on CNBC's Fast Money that he made a bad call when he said that gold is going to make a parabolic move higher. He explained that gold is making new lows, and the up trend looks like it's broken. Gold is also falling relatively to euro and British pound. He added that it looks like the game has changed and people are worried about deflation. Inflation is not an issue any more, and there are signs of the slowing of the economy and the non-growth of the monetary base. Dennis Gartman concluded that $1,260 has been the top, and he was wrong when he said that it is going to move higher. If you are interested in gold you can take a look at SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), ProShares Ultra Gold (ETF) (NYSE: UGL) and Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX)."
2010-07-19, Gold Holds Many Keys for the Markets Worldwide ,"This morning spot gold is declining lower by 9.70 to $1178.70 an ounce. The popular SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) are trading lower by 1.31 to $115.40. This decline comes in gold even as the stock market indexes are bouncing a little bit higher today. This is telling us that deflation is now front and center and the major market indexes will also face this selling pressure after every rally or bounce. That is how deflation works as it will take everything lower. Since 2001 gold has been in a bull market making new highs in 2010. Please remember that the only way that the market indexes can go up and trade higher is if gold trades higher ultimately. It is possible that the major stock indexes can trade higher without gold, however, that should not last long. Meanwhile, gold can and has traded higher without the market. Gold mining stocks are also under pressure today. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is trading lower by 0.67 to $47.87. The GDX should have some daily support around the $47.50 area in the near term. Should this support level fail to hold for the GDX then the $46.00 area would be the next important support area for this highly popular ETF. Randgold Resources LTD (NASDAQ: GOLD) is trading lower this morning by 0.37 to $90.78. Rangold LTD will have some daily chart support around this current level do to the daily 50 moving average being of some support. Should the stock break below the 50 moving average support area the $87.50 level would be the next daily chart support area. Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE: AUY) is under pressure this morning trading lower by 0.13 to $9.40. This stock is now trading at a new low for 2010. Yamana Gold inc will have important support around the $9.00 level and more around $8.25. Both of these area could be potential short term bounce areas for this stock. Gold and gold miners both remain under pressure this morning. While gold often trades higher when the markets rally it is rare to see the markets rally higher without gold. Therefore, it is always important to be cautious of any market rally when gold id declining. Remember gold trades higher as the markets get inflated and often when fear enters the hearts of investors. Continue to watch gold very closely here as it holds a lot of the keys for the major market indexes worldwide. Nicholas Santiago Chief Market Strategist www.InTheMoneyStocks.com"

2010-07-27,Gold Miners Near Attractive Levels,The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) have topped out on June 28th around the $54.00 level. Since that time this basket of gold mining stocks has declined sharply and is now trading around the $47.67 area. On July 19th the GDX found support and bounced at $46.99. This area still looks to be an important support area for this highly popular ETF. Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE: NEM) is a leading mining stock that has sold off sharply over the past few weeks. This stock is now trading at support and could be do for a bounce soon. Newmont Mining Corp should have support at the $55.75 level. Should this level fail to hold up as support the $54.00 area would be the next important support level. Randgold Resources LTD (NYSE: GOLD) has also sold off sharply since late June when it traded as high as $99.67. This stock is now trading down at $89.15. Should this leading gold miner trade down to the $88.00 - $87.50 area it would look attractive as this is an important support area. The stock will also have a lot of support around the $85.00 level which is another possible bounce area. When everyone loves a stock or sector that is when the professional trader wants to give them what they want. When everyone hates or strongly dislikes a sector or stock that is when it becomes interesting for a potential buy. The gold mining stocks are now nearing those attractive levels.

2010-07-27,"Small-Caps, Mid-Caps, & Commodities Hitting 200 MA Resistance 07-27-2010","Cusick’s Corner The market started to hit some resistance into the close, plus commodities have stalled. This is a development because along with small and mid-caps, commodities like Copper, JJC are hitting strong resistance on the 200-Day Moving Average [MA]. If there is little to no follow through, this could be a potential road block for the equities to continue to rally. Watch the Crude Inventories, due out at 10:30am ET, which could also put pressure on equities as well. Gold is on the break to the downside, testing its 200-Day MA -- keep an eye to see if support kicks in. See you Midday. Stocks finished mixed on a day of quiet market action Tuesday. Earnings were again in focus and DuPont (DD) was the day’s best gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after the chemicals company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and raised its future guidance. Shares finished the day up 3.6 percent. The major averages also seemed to find some support early Tuesday after UBS and Deutsche Bank reported strong results in Europe. A report on consumer confidence seemed to weigh a bit in midday trading after the Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment fell to 50.4, down from 54.3 in June and below economist estimates of 51. Yet, with the earnings-reporting season in full swing, the economic data didn’t do much and the market action remained mixed into the close. At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 13 points. The NASDAQ had lost 8. Bullish Flow Alcoa (AA) lost 2 pennies to $11.02 and noteworthy trading was seen in the aluminum maker’s January 12.5 call options. The top trades were two blocks of 10,000 at 73 and 74 cents, when the bid-ask was 72 to 74 cents, and appears to have been initiated by a call buyer. Several other blocks also traded at 73 and 74 cents. At the end of the day, volume had swelled to 53,430 contracts. These investors might be buying the calls in anticipation of a move higher through yearend. AA has had a rough 2010 so far, down 36.3 percent from its mid-January highs. By purchasing the January 12.5 call options, these bullish investors are assured the right to buy the stock at $12.5 through the January 2011 expiration, even if shares rebound back to January 2010 highs near $18 per share. Bullish order flow was also seen in Sprint (S), Xerox (XRX), and MGM. Bearish Flow International Rectifier (IRF), the El Segundo, CA chipmaker, finished down 4 cents to $20.19 and put options were busy for a second time in three days. Friday, about 1,000 August 20 puts traded. Volume picked up again Tuesday. This time, 1,661 August 20 puts changed hands. In addition, 2154 December 20 puts and 672 December 22.5 puts also traded. Total volume was 4527 puts and 156 calls, which is 26X the average daily volume for IRF. The top trade was a lot of 400 Aug 20 puts at 70 cents on ISE, which was an opening customer buyer, according to sentiment data. Indeed, with more than 80 percent of the puts trading at the Ask and implied volatility up 5 percent to 40.5, it appears that put buyers were dominating the action and bracing for possible weakness in IRF shares in the weeks ahead. No news on the stock to explain the action. It might be a play on earnings due mid-to-late August. Bearish flow also picked up in Genzyme (GENZ), Juniper Networks (JNPR), and CNinsure (CISG). Index Trading Overall index options volume remains light, with 344,000 calls and 496,000 puts traded on the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) and other cash indexes Tuesday. The volume represents about 83 percent the recent average daily. The major averages are trading in a narrow range and volatility remains light, which is not unusual during the peak period of the earnings reporting season. Basically, companies that report strong results move higher, and those that fail to live up to expectations, move lower. The result is mixed market action like today. The S&P 500 trading in an 11-point range and finished down 1.2 points. In this environment, institutional investors are less likely to buy index puts to protect portfolios and that helps explain the low volume in the index market. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) edged up .46 to 23.19 and is seeing quiet action as well. ETF Trading An interesting spread traded in the Market Vectors Miners ETF (GDX) late Tuesday. Shares finished down $1.80 to $47.09 after August gold plummeted $25 to $1158 an ounce. The interesting trade is a diagonal call spread after an investor sold 15,000 September 51 calls at 80 cents and bought 15,000 December 55 calls at $1.22. This spread, at a 42-cent net debit, might be a roll of calls from September to December (and up 4 strikes). Or, it might be a bet that GDX will stay below $51 through September expiration and then see a strong rally, beyond $55, during the final three months of the year."

2010-08-06,Preparing Your Portfolio for Inflation,"It seems these days, everywhere I look, I see the word “deflation.” I’ve read about the destruction of debt and things like that, but then I see that corporations have never owed more money, and the ginormous balance sheet of the Federal Reserve. I even saw on TV that Pimco’s El-Erian switched to the deflation camp, but a closer look at the interview showed that he saw a 25% chance of a deflation scenario. That’s 75% chance of something else! Inflation? Stagflation? (To read Justin Rohrlich's take on food regulation, click here.) Peter Lynch was famous for his investment principle: Invest in what you know. Well this is what I know: I’m paying more for just about everything. I recently asked a friend to give me 10 examples of something that went up in price and 10 things that went down in price. Obviously, the 10 things that went up in price were easy -- beef, pork, bread, orange juice. And keep in mind that beef isn't necessarily something we need, and is considered a luxury in many other societies. Sure, housing has gone down in price and is likely to go down further. But even then, there's an argument that the consumer is now more levered with respect to housing (I'll save this debate for another time). (To read Todd Harrison's view of recently released payroll data, click here.) So for those of you that are expecting massive inflation, here are some plays to consider: The most obvious play is gold. It’s no surprise and has been talked about on many websites, but it’s far from a bubble. Consider the GLD ETF (NYSE: GLD) with a market cap of $45 billion. It’s a pimple on the elephant's ass compared to the weekly bond auctions from the Treasury. And when we see gold shoot up 5% a day like wheat currently is, maybe then we can revisit this bubble question. Look to the gold miners and the GDX ETF (NYSE: GDX) which are breaking the month-long downtrend. So even the fast-money guys might have an opportunity right now. But for the longer-term perspective, Professor Bill Fleckenstein said it best: These miners are sort of like central banks that print a lot of money, except they aren’t staffed by a bunch of losers.

2010-08-19,Not All Commodity ETFs Are Created Equal,"There are many ways to classify commodity ETFs. One alternative is by the type of commodity they track, such as gold or oil. Another is by the type of investment product they use. There are three common types of commodity ETFs by the type of investment: physical commodities, futures-based, and equity-based. Understanding the nuances of these different investments is important when considering commodity ETFs. Physically backed commodity ETFs invest directly in the physical commodity, and issue shares backed by the physical inventory. The largest physically backed ETF is the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) with $50 billion in assets. This is more gold than the official gold reserves of Switzerland or China. Important considerations for physically backed ETFs are the cost, safety and permanence of storing the commodity. Storage and insurance costs can be prohibitive for a commodity such as oil. Storing perishable agricultural commodities is not only expensive but also impractical. As a result, most physically backed ETFs invest in precious metals, such as gold, silver or platinum, which can be stored for long periods of time without losing their value and where the cost of storage is low relative to the value of the commodity. Futures-based commodity ETFs invest in futures contracts for the particular commodity it tracks. An example is the U.S. Natural Gas Fund (NYSE: UNG), which has $2.5 billion in assets. There has been a lot of negative press about futures-based ETFs, the most recent one from Bloomberg Businessweek (“Amber Waves of pain”, July 22, 2010). The article chronicled two problems that caused the returns of futures-based commodity ETFs to significantly lag the return of the commodity itself. The first one has been well documented and is caused by the fact that many commodity markets have been in contango for quite some time. The article suggests a second, more sinister problem with futures-based ETFs. Because the ETFs roll the futures contracts at set times, “professional futures traders exploit the ETFs’ monthly rolls at the little guy’s expense.” U.S Commodity Funds, the firm behind the U.S. Natural Gas Fund, is launching a futures-based commodity ETF that seeks to avoid the contango issue by concentrating in commodities that are in backwardation, which is the opposite condition to contango. Contango: when the future price of a commodity is higher than the current (spot) price.) Some futures based funds are structured as Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs), which have the additional counterparty credit risk exposure to the bank selling the notes. An example of a futures-based commodity ETN is the iPath Dow Jones-UBS Platinum ETN (NYSE: PGM), which is exposed to the credit risk of the issuer, Barclays Bank PLC. Equity based commodity ETFs do not invest in the physical commodity but rather buy shares of companies involved in the commodity. An example if the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) which invests in shares of gold mining companies. The returns of these funds, while correlated with the price of the commodity, do not track the prices of the underlying commodity. These funds tend to be more volatile than the price of the commodity, and typically rise faster than the price of the commodity when commodity prices increase, but also fall faster than the price of the commodity when commodity prices decline. The following chart from the Journal of Indexes article “Rethinking Investing in Commodities,” May/June 2010, shows the performance of three types of commodity based indices since 2003: equities, physical, and spot, and compares them to the return of the S&P 500. Equity based commodity indices performed best during this period followed by the spot index. Futures-based indices performed worse among these three types of commodity indices but still managed to beat the returns of the S&P 500 during that period by a small margin. Source: Journal of Indexes, “Rethinking Investing in Commodities,” May/June 2010 In summary, not all commodity ETFs are created equal and have different structures, risks, and returns. The following table shows a sample of commodity based ETFs and ETNs across these three types of commodity based investments, equities, physical and futures-based commodities: Disclosure: No holdings Bruno del Ama is the CEO of Global X Funds.

Should the GDX trade above that resistance point then the $51.50 area would be the next important resistance level. see chart:http://www.inthemoneystocks.com/userfiles/image/gdx%208_25_10.bmp

2010-08-30,Stock up on gold miners,"Ever since I started my investment career as a mining analyst in 1984, I have taken a keen interest in gold stocks. In particular, I always keep a close eye on the relative strength of the miners versus the metal as stocks often lead bullion.The chart below has been constructed by dividing the MarketVectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) by the streetTRACKS Gold Trust (GLD). A rising trendline indicates outperformance by gold stocks against bullion, whereas a declining line shows the metal having the upper hand. After a period of underperformance until October 2008, the miners outperformed bullion for about 12 months before drifting lower until January this year. The curve for mining stocks then turned upwards and led the metal higher.Source: StockCharts.comIn addition to the nascent outperformance by gold stocks, the Gold Miners Bullish Percent Index (BPGDM) shows almost 60% of the 32 stocks in the Gold Miners Index are now in point and figure uptrends.The sentiment indicator is used like all bullish percent indices: readings over 70 are overbought while drops below 30 are oversold. Importantly, the last two times that an oversold condition existed were the end of 2008 and during the first quarter of 2010. The late 2008 upturn signaled a major rally in gold shares. The latest upturn this year similarly appears to be signaling better tidings for gold and silver shares. While the BPGDM is no longer oversold, it’s generally a positive sign for a group when more than half of its stocks are in new uptrends.Source: StockCharts.comI remain bullish on gold bullion and gold miners (GDX and its younger brother GDXJ), but repeat my usual advice that the yellow metal and gold-related instruments should only be bought at times of pullbacks.Did you enjoy this post?

2010-09-02,Gold Rushing on Into Autumn,"Gold glittered in August, registering an unusually strong performance for the month, and now kicks off what has historically proven its strongest period of the year. The yellow metal climbed 5.7% last month. Historically, the August price tends to rise only 2.5% above July. Gold is now nearing its settlement high of $1,257 an ounce reached on June 18. Year to date, it’s up 13.3%. (To view David Banister's reasoning for why silver may make big gains, click here.) As we write here in the early afternoon on Wednesday, the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (GLD), which tracks the price of bullion, is down 0.2%. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), which includes holdings like Barrick Gold (ABX), Goldcorp (GG), Newmont Mining (NEM), AngloGold Ashanti (AU), and Kinross Gold (KGC), is down 1.2%. Multiple engines have been driving gold’s run to the upper right-hand corner of the chart, say market pros. (To see Jeffery Cooper's article on how panic buying and selling days seem to follow one another, click here.) For one, investors have turned to gold as a safe-haven investment in response to an uncertain economic environment. There's been a steady stream of downbeat data sparking worry about a US economy losing momentum, from free-falling existing home sales to volatile initial jobless claims. Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans recently said that the risks of a double-dip recession have risen in the last six months. “A double dip is not the most likely outcome but I am concerned about how strong the recovery will be,” he said. (To read Todd Harrison's views about naked short sales being banned, click here.) Analysts at CIBC World Markets in Toronto, who see $1,400 gold next year, remind us that during the Great Recession, “gold was one of the only investment classes that provided positive returns. This fact will not be forgotten if the next recession materializes.” Tom Pawlicki, the precious metals analyst at MF Global, expects the gold market to maintain its drive to the upside, with prices likely advancing toward $1,270 over the next couple weeks To read the rest of this article, head over to Minyanville."

2010-09-03,A Better Way To Trade Gold? (GDX),"While the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE: GLD) seems to attract all the attention from market pundits and trade strategists, the fact of the matter is that the relative nominal gains that one can achieve by trading the ETF is small as compared to other commodities like Silver. Yet, traders and investors continue to trade in gold; this led Benzinga to take a look at better way to play movements in gold—long or short. Enter the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which replicates the price and yield performance of the AMEX Gold Miners Index by investing in the names that make up the index in an undiversified manner. By buying or shorting this ETF, you are not only making a bullish or bearish bet on the price of Gold itself, but also on the implicit leverage within the business model of running a gold mining company. Therefore the price movements are greater (in both directions) without taking on more leverage. Some traders will ask, “Why not pick individual names as opposed to a miner index?” While it is most certainly possible to reap large gains by doing research on individual names, their production costs, and mining prospects, it is often a minefield, no pun intended, with smaller, illiquid names often moving sharply in one direction or the other independent of fundamental points (think hedge funds buying/selling and insiders selling stock). Therefore, by buying a basket of the names, those outliers are moderated via relative diversification. Now that there is a case for keeping the GDX on your radar, this begs the question, “Where is the ETF headed?” From a technical standpoint, the ETF looks like it can run higher. Just a few days ago the GDX popped above the key $54.25 resistance level, making a new 9-month high of $54.49. However, there is one hitch to the giddee-up—the ETF failed to close above the $54.25 level with trading being mixed ever since. This does not mean that the ETF is broken, only that it is consolidating and probably a listless trade in the meantime. Traders should look for confirmation of the uptrend by the ETF testing and holding the 50-day moving average; going long (or short) at that point gives a much higher likelihood of trading success. For more great research like this, as well as how to play it through options…please visit Benzinga’s Options & Volatility Edge and Benzinga’s Cash Generator."

2010-09-20,Treasuries Breaks Long Term Trend As Precious Metals Continue To Move Higher,"Since the emergence of the European Debt crisis in April 2010, treasuries have been in a strong uptrend as investors have been seeking protection from risky assets.April to August 2010 was a deflationary period, similar to the fourth quarter of 2008 when treasuries soared higher before the massive government stimulus. Stocks have been in a five month correction. Now, in September 2010, long term treasuries are suffering a correction and break of long term trend support. Long term treasuries are unable to find support at the 50 day moving average. I highlighted a few weeks ago that treasuries appear to be making a top as the Chinese cut back on U.S. debt. The massive efforts from Washington to prevent a double dip appear to be putting a respite in the decline in equity markets. It also appears that The Fed will continue to easy monetarily during this crisis as they meet tomorrow and is expected to accommodate further. The Fed has already stated that they will keep interest rates low well into 2011. This is very bullish for silver and gold. Efforts to deflate the currency have succeeded and now the dollar is challenging new lows and breaking through support. Treasuries have corrected considerably along with the dollar. Although the policy makers in Washington have revived the equity markets, the long term effect on the dollar and long term debt will be detrimental. The markets are at resistance now and are very overbought. I would consider being careful on this rally as a deteriorating currency and high unemployment will put pressure on the consumer. The precious metals long term uptrend is in fact the best place to be during this ongoing debt crisis. Now there is a massive flow to silver and gold. I would not go chasing it now with the masses. There will always be corrections and sales on gold and silver in a bull market as I highlighted to my readers four weeks ago right before the rally. Silver is especially overextended and could have a healthy pullback. There will be sales in the future as profit taking is imminent as it is overextended over its 50 and 200 day moving averages. Subscribe to my free newsletter for trading signals and strategies at http://goldstocktrades.com. It appears that the strategies from the central bank are now reflating the economy as gold, silver and base metals have reached new highs, while the dollar and U.S. treasuries are correcting considerably. I believe the trend of sovereign debt defaults will continue and central banks raising their positions in precious metals. This is the beginning of a major rush into gold and silver We are currently seeing a huge transfer of capital into gold, silver and mining stocks. I believe the best way to invest in emerging markets is to buy gold, silver and base metals that these countries are now importing rather than exporting. I also see the possibility of the equity market, dollar and treasuries decoupling from silver and gold as they have made extremely upside breakouts since our bullish call on precious metals at the end of July. It has made an explosive move and is extended way above support and moving averages so a pullback is inevitable. I am a long term silver bull but at this point would wait for a healthy pullback and secondary buypoints will be alerted to my readers first at http://goldstocktrades.com."

2010-09-27,Bond & Equity Markets Realigning  09-27-2010,"Cusick's Corner The market sold off into the close, realigning the Bond and Equity markets today. In previous months this situation held true, “as Bond yields go, so does the market” only to be decoupled this month up until today. The 10 year pulled back hard today, and into the last half hour of trading, the market looks to have taken notice and pulled back support, ESZ10 1137. Watch to see if this is broached as we get closer to end of the month. See you Midday. Stocks faced a bit of selling pressure late in the day and the major averages finished near session lows Monday. With no economic data to guide the action, the early attention was on another round of merger and acquisition activity. Southwest (LUV) made a bid for Air Tran (AAI), Unilever (UL) made an offer for Albert Culver (ACV) and Walmart (WMT) moved to buy South Africa's Massmart. The news didn't seem to have much market impact, however, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average was modestly lower into midday. Trading was rangebound until the final hour. Then, a wave of selling hit and sent the Dow down 48 points on the day. The industrial average traded in a narrow 63-point range and finished two points off its worse levels ahead of home price and consumer confidence data Tuesday morning. Bullish Flow Bullish trading was seen in a number of airlines Monday. The sector saw notable strength after Southwest Airlines made a bid for Air Tran. US Airways (LCC), for example, gained 30 cents to $9.29 and options volume rose to 7X the average daily. Approximately 37,000 calls and 2,240 puts traded on the airline. November 10 calls were the most actives and the action included a buyer of 18,300 at 65 cents per contract. At the end of the day, 20,375 traded hands, as some investors seem to now be looking for LCC to move beyond $10 by the November expiration. Bullish options action was also seen in AMR, Dryships (DRYS), Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR). Bearish Flow Put activity picked up in Procter & Gamble (PG). Shares lost 60 cents to $61.04 and were one of twenty-four Dow stocks to finish with losses Monday. Meanwhile, in the options, about 20,000 puts and 8,000 calls traded on the ticker. The top trade was a block of 4,000 January 2012 puts at the 45 strike. It was part of a ratio spread, in which the investor sold 2,000 of the January (2012) 60 puts at $6 to buy 4,000 of the 45s at $1.80. This ratio backspread was initiated at a $2.40 credit, which the strategist keeps if shares hold above $60 through the January 2012 expiration. However, substantial profits are also possible if PG plunges between now and then. Bearish flow also picked up in Northern Trust (NTRS), Monsanto (MON), and UBS. Index Trading Trading was very slow in the index pits Monday, with 314,000 calls and 413,000 puts traded across the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) and other cash indexes. The total volume of 727,000 is only about 68 percent the recent average daily, according to data from Trade Alert. With only three trading days left until the end of September, portfolio managers are probably reluctant to buy index puts for fear of hurting the quarter performance numbers. The cost of premium would negatively affect results if the stock market ends the quarter on a strong note. Basically, there seems to be little interest in put buying after the strong month of September for the equity market. Of course, that will likely change if we begin to see an increase in market volatility. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) gained .83 to 22.54, indicating a modest increase in expected volatility Monday. ETF Trading Market Vector Gold Miner ETF (GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that holds shares of mining companies like Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (GLD). Shares finished Monday's session off 33 cents to $55.34 on a slow day of trading for gold. The yellow metal lost $1.3 to $1,295 an ounce. Yet, gold remains not far from record highs and one bullish strategist seems to be looking for a sustainable rally in the gold miners. In morning trading Monday, this strategist apparently bought 15,000 GDX December 56 calls at $2.83, sold 15,000 GDX December 60 calls at $1.30 and sold 15,000 December 62 calls at 85 cents. This three-way spread is similar to a ratio spread (buying 1 and selling 2), but has three different strike prices. The maximum pay-off is at the middle strike, or if GDX settles at $60 per share at the December expiration."
2010-09-28,Frank Holmes: Gold Absolutely Still a Buy,"In an recent report by Aaron Task, Frank Holmes said, Gold jumped back above $1300 per ounce Tuesday morning and absolutely has more upside ahead. Frank Holmes is CEO and CIO of U.S. Global Investors, which has about $2.6 billion of assets. In the article Holmes adds, Despite all the hype about its multi-year rally, gold is actually lagging many other commodities in that it hasn't yet eclipsed its 1980 high on an inflation-adjusted basis...the same is true of silver. There is no bubble in gold, its a pretty easy lay-up that gold can double from here over the next 5 years. Some popular gold related stock include SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) and Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX)"
2010-09-28,"Government Almost Forcing Investors to Buy Everything (SPY, LQD, IEF, GDX, VNQ, CRBQ)","Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, the United States government has been on a non-stop stimulus, quantitative easing, and asset support campaign unprecedented in scale and reach. Think about that for a second. Over the past 2 years the United States (along with several foreign governments) have been supporting (and interfering) with the private sector to an extent not seen for 80 years. Interest rates are near 0%, massive amounts of bailouts have been approved and executed, monetary and fiscal policy are the most accommodative ever, and government stimulus seems never ending. All of this is distorting the ‘real' economy almost beyond recognition. Even so, the economy has hit a 'soft patch' recently. In response the Fed has basically said they will not allow the economy to slip into another recession. For the first time in history the government is now in the business of preventing ANY downturn in economic activity EVER. It is a monstrous experiment with results unknown. How does one successfully invest in this experiment? The government is basically saying 'do not save money, but if you do, you better not even think of saving it in US Dollars or Cash'. Any asset other than cash, however, should benefit (in the short term) from all the government support. Equities as represented by the SPDR S&P 500 Index ETF (NYSE: SPY) will benefit as the dollar weakens, interest rates stay low (or even fall further), and government spending/easing spurs economic activity. Bonds (represented by IShares Investment Grade Debt (NYSE: LQD) and the Ishares 7 -10 Year treasury (NYSE: IEF) will benefit as interest rates remain low, possibly fall further with government purchases of treasuries, and the horizon for very low interest rates expands. Alternative assets such as real estate (Vanguard REIT Index (NYSE: VNQ), and industrial commodities (Jeffries Commodity Equity Index (NYSE: CRBQ) would also respond well as economic activity is subsidized, interest rates remain low, and dollar denominated assets rise in nominal value. However the advantages to all these asset classes, especially equities and bonds, are shrouded in long term uncertainty. At some point interest rates will rise, taxes will have to rise, entitlements will need to be trimmed, and debt will at some point need to be restructed. Equities and bonds will not perform well as these headwinds take center stage. No one knows when these factors will present themselves, could be in 10 months or 10 years. The only assets that should retain their value longer term through this ‘new regime' should be gold and some foreign currency based assets. Gold, available through Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) or SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) will keep rising until and unless world governments stop spending, rise interest rates, implement massive austerity plans, and take ‘the pain' up front. This seems unlikely anytime soon. Safe foreign currency assets (conservative equities, some bonds, etc.) will also benefit as the US dollar inevitably falls. This will be especially true versus emerging market assets. The government is trying to force the public into risk assets. Short term investors will probably comply, longer term however, this might not work as planned. I would advise most investors to hold a decent amount of their portfolio in foreign bonds, conservative foreign equities, commodities, gold, and hedged funds. We have no choice, we all have to live through the government's mammoth economic experiment, but we do not have to risk all our money on it."

2010-09-30,September To Remember,"All the talk in the media is about how good the month of September has been. Since the start of the month of September the S&P 500 Index has rallied higher by about 11.0 percent. As we all know by now, historically September has been one of the worst month's for the major stock indexes. However, in the past seven years only 2008 was a negative September. The cause for the meteoric rise in the market indexes this month is very simple. It was simply the decline in the U.S. Dollar Index. The U.S. Dollar Index is a measure of the value of the U.S. Dollar against a basket of six foreign currencies. They are the Euro (57.6%), Japanese Yen (17.8%), British Pound (11.9%), Canadian Dollar (9.1%), Swedish Krona (4.3%), and the Swiss Franc (3.6%). Therefore, should the U.S. Dollar Index decline then the major stock indexes around the world will inflate higher. Please remember the U.S. Dollar Index is the world's reserve currency. Since June 7th, 2010 the U.S. Dollar Index has traded lower by 11.0 percent. In the month of September the U.S. Dollar Index has declined by just over 5.0 percent. In the currency world this is certainly a major move lower. The leading stocks this month have certainly been the NASDAQ 100 stocks. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Baidu.com Inc. (NASDAQ: BIDU), and Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), have all soared higher throughout the month of September. Often it is the commodity stocks that will lead the advance on the back of the falling U.S. Dollar Index. However, in September technology took the lead. Gold, silver and gold mining stocks lead the advance in commodities. The popular SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) has been making new all time highs nearly every trading day in September. Gold seems to rally when investors fear the stock market and when the U.S. Dollar Index declines sharply. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDX) has traded very similar to the precious metal by making new highs for the year and reaching its 2008 high levels. This should be a short term resistance level for the GDX at this time. There are a couple of negative facts for the September rally that must be pointed out. The first is the weak volume. Historically, healthy markets rise on heavy volume and decline or pullback on light volume. That has certainly not been the case in this rally. The second negative fact that can be easily seen in this rally is that the financial stocks have lagged the major market indexes. Since the March 2009 low the financial stocks have been leaders. That is not the case in the month of September. So there you have it, the month of September has been wrapped up in a few paragraphs. 2010 has certainly been a traders year so far and it is likely to remain a traders year into the New Year.

2010-10-05,"Gold Settles At New Nominal High…Again. (GLD, GDX, UUP)","Gold futures skyrocketed once again today, ending the regular session at $1,340.60 per ounce. The SDPR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), which tracks the price of Gold futures, ended the session higher by 1.97%, trading at $130.99. Much of this movement was due to falling of the U.S. Dollar Index, which fell once again today. The Powershares DB US Dollar Bull Index (NYSE: UUP), which tracks the Dixie, ended the session lower by 0.84%, at $22.56. Interesting to note is that the Gold miners continue to outperform to price of gold futures; the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) ended the session higher by 3.08%, trading at $57.26 and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) ended the session higher by 3.96%, trading at $34.66. Silver futures also ran higher today, touching a 30-year high, at $22.92 per ounce. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), which tracks silver futures, ended the session higher by 3.86%, trading at $22.34."
2010-10-06,Miners Keep On Chugging,"The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDX) made another new high for the year yesterday. This move higher comes as the U.S. Dollar Index declined to a new multi-month low. The GDX remains in a strong technical uptrend trading above the daily chart 20, 50, and 200 moving averages. The next important support level on the daily chart for the GDX will be around the $59.00 level. Intra-day the popular gold mining ETF will face resistance around the $58.00 area and $58.50 level. Leading gold mining stocks that are trading higher this morning are Newmont Mining Corp.(NYSE: NEM), Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd.(NYSE: AEM), and Goldcorp Inc.(NYSE: GG). Yesterday these stocks all surged sharply higher the next trading session they are likely to rest or pause before trading higher. Therefore, do not expect any major breakouts on these leading mining stocks today. Nicholas Santiago Chief Market Strategist www.InTheMoneyStocks.com"

2010-10-12,Goldman's Golden Gold Forecast Should Benefit These ETFs,"Gold and its seemingly never-ending run to new heights got another boost on Monday with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) saying the yellow metal could be trading as high as $1,650 an ounce in a year. Goldman added that gold could see $1,400 an ounce in three months and $1,525 an ounce in six months and recommended buying Comex December 2011 gold futures and January 2011 Nymex platinum. For those that opt not to play the futures market, the platinum play is the ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT). Backed by physical platinum, PPLT and its cousin, the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) have become trendy picks to play a rebound in global auto demand. As for gold, if you're looking beyond the usual suspects like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), the ProShares Ultra Gold ETF (NYSE: UGL) is a fine way to leverage your returns on gold's ascent. For whatever reason, the PowerShares DB Gold ETF (NYSE: DGL) rarely makes it into the gold ETF conversation, but don't ignore this fund. DGL tracks a rules-based index composed of futures contracts on gold and is intended to reflect the performance of gold. It goes without saying gold miners benefit from high gold prices, so be sure to be involved with either the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) or the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Silver is the derivative play of choice, though it wasn't mentioned in the Goldman report. The Market Vectors Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) is the way to go on that front."
2010-10-14,Out-of-Control Gold Meets Leveraged ETN and ETF Products ,"Gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) have become the new fad for 401k plans and individual investors. Folks have been flocking to the key gold ETFs via SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) and even the ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (NYSE: SGOL). In fact, the SPDR Gold Trust would be one of the top five or six central government banks in the world if measured solely in gold holdings. Anytime you get a hot market, as we can see now with gold, you can bet more investment vehicles pop up to capitalize on the fad. Enter leveraged gold ETFs and ETNs, which add another layer to playing the gold market right now. Two of the most obvious and liquid note-funds from the same family that take on leverage in the directional gold trades are the PowerShares DB Gold Double Long ETN (NYSE: DGP) and PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ).

2010-10-15,Don't Forget About This Mining ETF,"Considering all the hype that emerging markets ETFs get and the love affair that many traders and investors enjoy with materials and mining ETFs, one would think that an ETF that combines those worlds would get a lot of attention. That's not the case with the EGShares Dow Jones Emerging Markets Metals & Mining Titans ETF (NYSE: EMT). To say EMT gets no press is simply inaccurate, but it is an ETF that is easy to miss. Don't make that mistake. EMT touched a new 52-week high on Thursday and if it can crack psychological resistance at $22 it could be off to the races. Or should we say off the races some more? EMT is up 25% in the past three months compared to a 15% run for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). And don't worry, EMT doesn't specialize in a bunch of emerging markets miners you've never heard of. Vale (NYSE: VALE), the largest iron ore maker in the world, is the ETF's top holding. Other familiar names include Gerdau (NYSE: GGB) and AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE: AU). EMT is BRC heavy as Brazil, China and Russia account for about 61% of the ETF's weight. India sneaks in with just over 6% and South Africa gets more than 20%. Support should be in place at $20, making for a decent entry point at current levels."
2010-10-15,Long-Term Inflation Fighters  10-15-2010,"Cusick's Corner The trend continues up and it's just not worth fighting a rising tide. Review the past four Corners for some ideas on trading this trending up market and how to mitigate the short-term impact of some momentary shakeouts. For those of you who are starting to see the potential for future inflation hitting the market, especially after the moves in commodities and longer end of the yield curve, it might be worth looking at some long-term inflation fighters. Here's an inflation-fighting product to consider and study this weekend -- TIPS, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. Also watch the Dollar, UUP, over the next week for a potential pop soon, especially with the 30yr yields on the move. Plus watch the Euro currency which has been on a tear to the upside, in spite of the fact that this bullish move has been in an overall bearish trending market. Have a good weekend. Stocks finished mixed on expiration Friday. Economic data was in focus early after the Commerce Department reported that Retail Sales were up .6 percent in September, which was better than the .4 percent increase that economists had expected. Separately, the Labor Department reported that the September CPI, a gauge of inflation at the consumer level, rose just .1 percent last month and half as much as expected. A third piece of data released Friday morning showed the NY Empire State Index of manufacturing activity up to 15.73 in October and much stronger-than-expected. Economists were looking for a reading of 5.75. Yet, while stocks held steady at the open on the upbeat data, a modest round of selling pressure surfaced in early trading after the University of Michigan reported that its index of consumer sentiment fell to 67.9 in October, from 68.2 and below economists estimates of 68.5. The disappointing sentiment numbers and notable weakness in GE, BofA (BAC), and JP Morgan (JPM) seemed to weigh on the Dow Jones Industrial Average through midday. However, a post-earnings rally in Google (GOOG) helped keep the NASDAQ above water. The second half of trading was largely a continuation of the same theme, but with modest strength heading into the bell. At the close, the Dow was off 32 points, but the NASDAQ had added 33. Bullish Flow Western Digital (WDC) saw a day of heavy trading after peer Seagate Technology (STX) shares rallied on buy-out hopes. STX surged 22 percent on media reports the company is in talks to be bought out. WDC, which is in the same industry, gained $2.40 to $31.89 and options volume hit 4X the average daily. 24,000 calls and 12,000 puts traded on the ticker. January 41 calls were the most actives. About 3,000 changed hands. November 33 and January 35 calls saw action as well. Shares were up and some players were apparently taking positions in out-of-the-money calls in WDC on hopes a buyout of Seagate would bode will for other players in the storage device industry. Bullish options action was also seen in Seagate Tech (STX), Gap Stores (GPS), and WellPoint (WLP). Bearish Flow Banco Santander (STD) saw a second day of bearish trading. As noted in yesterday's wrap, about 11,000 puts and 600 calls traded on the Spanish bank Thursday, including a buyer of 5,000 November 14 puts at $1.25 per contract. Shares added 2 cents to $13.20 and options rose to 3X the average daily Friday. About 9,070 puts and 3,345 calls traded on the day. Unlike Thursday, most of the action today was in smaller lots. The top trade was 838 November 14 puts at the $1.25 asking price. At the end of the day, nearly 6,000 had traded. November 15 puts saw interest as well. There was no news on the stock. The action seems somewhat defensive or bearish, perhaps lingering concerns about the European Debt Crisis and ongoing problems in the banking world. Bearish flow also picked up in Computer Sciences (CSC), Alcoa (AA), and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS). Index Trading The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) saw another day of busy trading. VIX hit an intra-day high of 21.59, but finished the day down .85 to 19.03 after late-day strength helped lift the S&P 500 up 2.38 points to 1,176.19 Friday. Meanwhile, 253,000 calls and 89,000 puts traded on the volatility index. The top trades look like a call ratio backspread after one strategist apparently sold 20,000 VIX December 30 calls at $2.29 to buy 40,000 December 37.5 calls at $1.27. This spread might be to hedge the risk of volatility, as it generates its best profits if VIX rallies well beyond 37.5 through the December expiration. ETF Trading Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) saw day of active trading. Shares lost 78 cents to $57.41 after gold gave up $7.60 to $1,370 an ounce. Options volume in the GDX hit twice the average daily, with 62,000 calls and 97,000 puts traded on the fund. The top trade was a block of 40,000 January 2012 puts at the 25 strike, bought at 72 cents per contract. With GDX at current levels of $57.41, the contract is 56.5 percent out-of-the-money. An investor might have made the massive premium purchase to hedge their exposure to that sector of the market. GDX is an exchange-traded fund that holds shares of mining companies like Newmont Mining (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX)."
2010-10-18,"Peter Schiff Says No Bubble In Gold (GLD, GDX)","Aaron Task interviewed Peter Schiff regarding the possibility of a bubble in gold, and Schiff says we are only in the beginning stages of the gold trade. “I think we're still relatively early in the game, Schiff said. It's not rock bottom prices, but prices are not high for the metals, especially given what central banks are going to do.” Schiff goes on to say it's not a bubble in gold, because he isn't seeing any splits in any of the gold stocks (NYSE: GDX) or gold ETFs like SPDR GLD ETF (NYSE: GLD) that he owns. Schiff went on to say, Not a single gold stock I've owned has split. If this was a real mania, you know how many times these stocks would be splitting? Schiff weighed in with some other thoughts on the Treasury bubble, which is where he really sees the potential for a bubble. I've been talking about the bond bubble for years, Schiff said. I've never been able to figure out when it would burst because markets can be irrational for quite some time. But I do know it is a bubble. I do know the 10-year (note) should not be yielding 2.5%."

2010-11-16,November Rain: Nothing But Pain For These ETFs This Month,"Good grief. Wasn't this supposed to be a good month for stocks and ETFs? The Republicans dominated on Election Day. We got another round of quantitative easing. That good news has been countered by Ireland's fiscal mess and fears of an interest rate hike in China. Add in dollar strength and the past few days have been no time to be long. As such, recent ETF studs have turned into duds since last week. Let's look at a few. 1) iShares MSCI Thailand Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: THD): A Professor favorite, THD ran up almost in a straight line for six months and touched an all-time high at $68.70 earlier this month. THD has retreated 9% from that all-time high and is doing so on strong volume. The 20-day moving average didn't act as support and if the 50-day line fails as well, THD could fall below $60. 2) iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ): Any time investors get skittish about China, Brazil ETFs suffer. EWZ has also retreated almost 9% off its 52-week high at $81.77. The losing streak for EWZ is now pushing two trading weeks and if support around $74.50 doesn't hold, EWZ could retreat to $70. 3) Any mining ETF. Take a look at the performance of the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSE: COPX), the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) in the past week. All down about 8%. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has offered little respite, down more than 4% over the same time."
2010-11-18,John Paulson's High-Performance Gold Strategy ,"John Paulson almost single-handedly made gold “cool” again on Wall Street.

Since then gold has climbed 45% and major gold stocks (as tracked by the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF – (NYSE: GDX) have climbed more than 70%. Paulson's largest gains in gold, however, have come from using a unique strategy that reduces risk, increases gains, and you can use to truly maximize the gold bull market. Investing in “impaired” gold stocks When Paulson made his move into gold, he bought mostly gold and gold stocks.

2010-11-20,Why I Still Hate Gold,"Those of us who like to style ourselves as contrarians are never “wrong.” We're just early. At least that is what I keep telling myself. I've had a bearish view on gold for most of 2010, and attempted (unsuccessfully) to short it in the second quarter. “I was just early,” I told myself. And alas, given gold's recent move to all-time highs, it appears that I still am. In August, I penned a negative piece on gold that resulted in me getting quite a bit of hate mail (see “Sell Gold Now”). Among my favorites were these little gems: “Thank God this not-so-bright CFA has and will never give advice to my family concerning anything financial.” “I hope you and your clients short as much gold as you can get your hands on. You will get exactly what you so richly deserve.” “No one who understood gold would make some of the imbecilic statements in this article.” “I love how you b*tch about Indian gold consumption falling, while failing to mention the much LARGER INCREASE in gold consumption coming from China. THIS is exactly the point that defines you as a lying cheat. “ “I suggest the author get his meds readjusted and, his clients seek wiser advice from the drive-up window at McDonalds!” “Yuppie Turd!” The worst thing an investor can do is to get emotionally involved with their investments. Stocks, bonds, and commodities should all be viewed as meaningless love affairs, not potential marriage partners. Yet investors—and male investors in particular—have an odd way of developing feelings for the assets they buy. It's Just an Investment, People Just as sailors have for centuries given their ships a woman's name, to many men a stock becomes “his stock,” and if you insult it you might as well be insulting his wife or mother. In some extreme cases—and I see this with gold in particular—an investor will allow an investment to define them as a person. Being a “gold bug” is not simply believing in the investment merits of gold. It is an identity and one that exhibits many of the characteristics of a radical political movement or even a cult. (There is a fundamental belief: Gold is the “one true store of value” or the “one true currency.” There are also “prophets”—the Murray Rothbards and Ayn Rands, if you will—and “sacred texts”—Atlas Shrugged being the highest profile example.) When I gave my opinion that gold was a bad investment at current prices, the responses above show how personally the gold bugs took my comments. To them, I wasn't expressing an investment opinion; I was insulting their entire view of the world! This is not to pick on gold bugs, of course. The “dot com” bubble of the late 1990s had its true believers as well, as have all bubbles throughout history. Anyone who dared to question the investment merits of the high-flying internet stocks was ridiculed as an old fogey who “just didn't get it.” And in the interest of full disclosure, yours truly has lost 90-100% on a handful of investments over the years in which I was a “true believer.” What can I say, it happens to us all at one time or another. To be a successful contrarian investor over time, you have to suppress your emotions and political views and remain detached. You have to objectively examine the arguments being made for an investment. And in the words of world-renowned speculator George Soros, you have to “Find the trend whose premise is false, and bet against it.” I must admit, I sometimes have a hard time suppressing my emotional side as an investor. This is why I titled this article “I Still Hate Gold.” It irks me that I have lost money speculating against the yellow metal, and so I want it to fall. And then it irks me even further when I realize that I've allowed my emotions get the better of me. Knocking Down the Bulls' Arguments So, fully acknowledging my own psychological shortcomings, let's take a quick look at the bullish arguments for gold: Gold is a hedge against the hyperinflation and currency depreciation that is just around the corner due to the Fed's printing of money and the Obama Administration's wanton deficit spending. Gold represents stability of purchasing power I'll pick these apart one by one, starting with inflation. If there was ever a non-crisis crisis, it would be the inflation scare of 2010. There is almost universal agreement among gold enthusiasts that there is a wave of inflation coming from the Fed's machinations that will make the United States resemble Weimar Germany. Really? Because earlier this week it was announced that core consumer price inflation (which excludes food and energy prices due to their volatility) just hit its lowest reading since the data series began in 1957. Fed Chairman Bernanke is worried about deflation, not inflation. The money supply, despite the Fed's tinkering with the monetary base, has not grown significantly because money is being destroyed by the private sector faster than it is being created by the Fed. I know, I know, the government must be cooking its books. Of course it is. That's why the bond vigilantes have pushed bond yields higher…oh wait…bond yields are still near all-time lows. Yes, the Fed is manipulating the bond market. I get that. But the Fed, while the biggest buyer of bonds these days, is not the only buyer. And if bond investors were truly concerned about inflation or dollar depreciation, the 10-year Treasury would not be yielding less than 3%. The 1970s are not making a comeback. When I see a divergence between the bond market and the gold market, my bet is that it is the bond market that will ultimately be right. But doesn't gold at least represent stability of purchasing power in an unstable world? Again, not so much. Consider this little quote from the Financial Times. “If there were no dollar, and US shoppers paid for their groceries with gold coins, since 2000 the amount of gold needed to buy a loaf of bread or rent an apartment would have fallen by three-quarters. Deflation of 75 per cent in a decade is not an ideal characteristic for money.” (From “In Gold They Rush”) I should also add that investors who held their wealth in gold would have seen their purchasing power ruined in the two decades from 1980 to 2000, and that gold—unlike stock, bond, or real estate investments—pays no income. The basic assumptions underlying the gold bubble are flawed and driven more by charged ideology and anti-establishment sentiment than by actual economics. The time to have bought the barbarous relic was in 2000, when it traded for less than $300 per ounce and no one wanted it, and not ten years later after it has risen by more than a factor of 4 and when it has become fashionable. The contrarian move would be to sell gold and buy blue chip stocks—which are about as unloved today as gold was in 2000. But alas, I was “early” on this trade… Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA This blog is a free service of Sizemore Financial Publishing LLC, publisher of the Sizemore Investment Letter.

For more Voice of the People, visit http://at.zacks.com/?id=5851 Featured Post U.S. Dollar Comeback Halts Market Rally Today the U.S. Dollar Index has rallied back into positive territory after starting the morning sharply lower. Normally when the U.S. Dollar Index rallies the major stock market indexes will deflate and trade lower. However, today the major stock market averages have been able to still hold some of it's early morning gains. This strong stock market action is likely due to the very light volume and the agreement between the tax and unemployment agreement between the President and the Republican party. There where several asset classes that are feeling the effect of the stronger U.S. Dollar Index today. Gold, silver, and oil are all pulling back today. The popular SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) is trading lower by $1.52 to $137.59. The pullback in the GLD comes after the popular ETF made a new high this morning. The same type of trading action took place in the iShares Silver Trust (SLV). This morning the SLV made a new 52 week high at $30.00 and has sold off since that time. Spot crude also made a new high for the year this morning trading as high as $90.76 a barrel before pulling back. Spot crude closed lower on the session by 0.69 cents to $88.69 a barrel. Many extended commodity stocks such as United States Steel Corp. (X) and Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. (CLF) also pulled back from their intra-day highs. Gold and silver mining stocks also sold off today from an extended move on the daily charts. The popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) is trading lower by $1.04 to $62.74. At this time all of these pullbacks looks to nothing more than short term corrections. The new tax cut and unemployment agreement between the President and the Republican party should only have a short term positive effect. After all this agreement could add another $1-5 trillion to the U.S. deficit. This market is all about the short term gain and never looks at the long term pain which will certainly come again.

2010-12-07,Copper ETF: What's The Big Deal?,"News of the impending debuts of ETFs backed by physical copper sure has gotten a lot of attention. Copper-backed ETFs have become such a big deal that one might think the issuers fighting to enter the space have found a cure for cancer or solved cold fusion. There was the recent bit about JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) massive $1.5 billion copper trade on the London Mercantile Exchange. RBS has said a copper-backd ETF could boost prices to $4.50 a pound and one analyst quoted in a Financial Times piece said a successful copper ETF could be the difference between copper priced at $8,500 per ton and $10,000 per ton. Remember, the red industrial metal has never traded above $9,000 per ton. So as JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB), iShares and ETF Securities race to bring the first ballyhooed physical copper ETF to market investors may do well to, gasp, pay this even minimal attention. The reason is simple: In the ETF world, there are already exceptional ways to play copper. Meaning the miners. This is a trend that has already made itself clear with gold and silver. Gold mining ETFs, such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) have outperformed funds like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD). Sure, the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) has been on fire, but the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) has been even better. When it comes to copper, the iPath DJ-UBS Copper TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: JJC) hasn't disappointed. On the other hand, the First Trust ISE Global Copper Index (NYSE: CU) and the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSE: COPX) have left JJC in the dust. So when it comes to a physical copper ETF, it might be fair to say No big deal. *Performance data is for the last three months."

2010-12-08,'Fast Money' Recap: Market Rotation,The trading panel discussed the rotation from the commodities to the financials.
2010-12-08,Direxion To Introduce Leveraged Gold Miners ETFs,"Direxion, the largest issuer of leveraged ETFs, is looking to get in on the gold ETF action with two new 2x leveraged ETFs that track the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. Give Direxion credit because the company came up with nifty tickers for the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 2x Shares and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 2x Shares: NUGT and DUST respectively. Consider these funds leveraged equivalents to the wildly popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Gold mining stocks are essentially a play on gold and the stock market. Investors trade the miners instead of the metal because, as the price of gold goes up, miners' higher profit margins can boost earnings exponentially, and vice versa, Direxion said in a statement."
2010-12-10,Direxion Adds Leverage To Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX),"Stocks in the gold mining industry are among the most volatile stocks being traded. ETFs tracking them are also volatile. As of Wednesday (12/08/2010), traders can now get leveraged long and short access to this group via Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 2x Shares (NUGT) and Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 2x Shares (DUST). Both funds are getting their market exposure from either buying or shorting Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). So, if you really want to know what exposure you are getting with these new ETFs, then a visit to Van Eck Global's GDX overview page is the place to go. There you will learn the largest constituents of the underlying NYSE Arca GoldMiners Index and of GDX are Barrick Gold Corp (ABX) 17.1%, Goldcorp Inc (GG) 11.1%, Newmont Mining Corp (NEM) 9.6%, Silver Wheaton Corp (SLW) 6.2%, and Anglo Ashanti Ltd (AU) 5.7%. The largest country weights are Canada 62.1%, US 15.1%, South Africa 13.5%, and Peru 4.8%. The links to the NUGT overview and DUST overview don't provide very much information, nor does the combined fact sheet (pdf). To find the expense ratio, one must go to the Direxion Funds at a Glance section, from there select “performance”, and then scroll down to NUGT/DUST. There in the far right hand column you will find that expenses are capped at 0.95%. However, there is no indication as to whether the stated expense ratio includes the “acquired fund” 0.53% of GDX. The prospectus also does not address acquired fund fees. Since NUGT is buying GDX directly, perhaps as much as $2 of GDX for every $1 of NUGT, then acquired fund fees could be as high as 1.06%. Direxion needs to provide clarification regarding the fees associated with these new ETFs. However, even if the total expense ratio of NUGT turns out to be 2.01%, traders will likely still embrace it as it has the exposure and volatility they crave.

2010-12-16,Mining Stocks Face Short Term Pressure ,"Recently the gold mining stocks have been under pressure after making a new high in December 7th, 2010. The popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDX) traded as high as $64.62 on December 7th and is trading around $60.27 this morning. Normally after a stock or ETF makes a new high it will need to pause or consolidate the gains before trading higher. However, this time around the GDX has sold off and traded below the November 9th, 2010 top. When price action fails to hold the prior top or high it is usually an indication that a further correction is likely to take place. The GDX will have short term daily chart support around the $59.00 level which is the daily chart 50 moving average. The next important support level and likely bounce area for the GDX will be around the $57.50 area. The highly popular Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDXJ) is following a similar pattern to the GDX. This highly popular ETF will have some daily chart support around the $38.50 which is the daily chart 50 moving average. However, should the momentum push the ETF below this level the GDXJ will have strong support around the $37.25 area. Yamana Gold Inc.(NYSE: AUY) is a leading gold mining stock that made new highs for the year on December 7th, 2010 at $13.13. Since that time Yamana Gold Inc. has pulled back to $12.16. This stock is still trading above daily 20, and 50 moving averages which tell us that the stock is still in a strong technical position. Yamana Gold will have minor short term support around the $12.00. The $11.50 area is the daily 50 moving average and this should be fairly strong and a possible bounce level.

2010-12-16,Eleven For '11: Sector ETFs To Watch In The New Year,"Continuing with the theme of ETFs to watch in 2011, today the Professor is focussing on 11 non-leveraged sector ETFs that very well could be on the minds of traders in the new year. Some are dividend plays, others are plays on rising commodities prices, but each has a different reason for appearing on the list. Without further ado, in no particular, here's the list of 11 sector ETFs to watch in 2011. 1) Oil Services HOLDRs (AMEX: OIH): OIH is the quintessential $100 oil play, or at least one of them, making this ETF one to watch next year. OIH is also worth following to see how one of its top holdings, Transocean (NYSE: RIG), deals with the newly announced government lawsuit against it for its role in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. 2) Guggenheim Airline ETF (NYSE: FAA): Another $100 oil play, but in reverse. Assuming oil prices rise, airlines could be in for some pain. Margins for the group are expected to be weaker next year and how well the economy performs will be pivotal for this sector. 3) Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL): A play on emerging markets demand for coal, KOL is also an M&A play as constituents like Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) and Massey Energy (NYSE: MEE) are expected to be involved in further coal consolidation. 4) Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF): Will financials finally awake from their slumber? Will dividends be restored? Find out the answers to those pressing questions with XLF. 5) Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV): XLV should find itself atop many traders' lists, at least for a few weeks, if the Republicans are able to mount a legitimate challenge to over-throwing Obama-care. 6) PowerShares Aerospace & Defense ETF (NYSE: PPA): The big question here is how vulnerable is defense to possible spending cuts on Capitol Hill? Then again, politicians talk a good game, but rarely deliver on spending cuts. 7) Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): If gold's voracious rally finally stalls, or worse yet, the yellow metals falls in bloody fashion, GDX will be in trouble. If the trend doesn't reverse, GDX will continue its ascent. 8) Guggenheim Global Shipping ETF (NYSE: SEA): Dry bulk shippers were an obvious victim of the global financial crisis, but the group may be starting to show signs of life. SEA is the way to play a rebound in this group. 9) iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average (NYSE: IYT): The strength (or weakness) in the U.S. economy will be seen in IYT. Plus, Dow theorists love this ETF. 10) Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK): With tech companies sitting on massive hoards of cash, XLK is another M&A play and perhaps a dividend play. Of course, Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) makes XLK worth watching. 11) Vanguard REIT Index ETF (NYSE: VNQ): Another crisis victim, REITs need to make 2011 the year they restore investor confidence. Make VNQ your 2011 REIT play."

2010-12-22,Craig Effron and Curtis Schenker: Scoggin Capital Management,"Craig Effron and Curtis Schenker are what David Einhorn was before the Lehman debacle- brilliant hedge fund managers generally flying under the media's radar. Head of Scoggin Capital Management, they invest in mergers, spinoffs, bankruptcies, and financially distressed companies through stocks and bonds. Here is what Katherine Burton wrote about Scoggin in Hedge Hunters “Between 1988, the year he started the fund, and August 1, 2007, he produced average annual returns of 18.2 percent a year, after fees and using no borrowed money. He had only one losing year, 2002, when he was down 1.3 percent. His returns are not correlated to the stock market, and 90 percent of the time, his funds make money in the months the Standard & Poor's 500 Index is down.” Einhorn paid just homage to Schenker in Fooling Some of the People All of the Time The reason Schenker managed to make money when the market is down is that he protects himself at the first sign of trouble by buying put options on the market indices, or shorting them using ETFs or futures when options are expensive. He doesn't short individual stocks as a hedge, but he sometimes sells short if he believes that those stocks are going to go down. So he tries to create some value on the short side as well. Buying put options or shorting market indices isn't a magic formula for success . It's more like buying insurance- which has a real cost. The upside of buying insurance is it enables your survival. Many hedge funds shut down after catastrophic (30+%) losses because they have to earn back all their losses before collecting incentive fees again. In most cases key employees don't want to work for less money for a couple of years, so they quit. As a result, hedge funds lose their edge and rationally shut themselves down. Craig Effron and Curtis Schenker's Scoggin lost more than 30% between December 2007 and March 2009. Luckily, most of the other hedge funds performed horribly and there was no appetite for seeding new hedge funds. So Scoggin employees stayed put. One of Craig Effron's favorite investments is China. “When I got to China, I realized immediately that we were in America 1910. Today in America everyone hates everyone. There is so much negativity. In China, it is all positive. I don't know how it will play out, but this place is for real.” says Effron. Clearly he doesn't agree with Jim Chanos , who is a bear on China's property market. Scogging's latest 13F filing reveal that Craig Effron and Curtis Schenker have several of the stocks David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital has. Apple (AAPL), Carefusion (CFN), CIT Group (CIT), Ensco PLC (ESV), Flagstar Bancorp Inc (FBC), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), Microsoft (MSFT), Pfizer (PFE), and Sprint Nextel Corp (S). Interestingly, Scoggin started buying Sprint Nextel before David Einhorn did. So it might be David Einhorn who is monkeying Scoggin in this case.

2011-02-22,"BTDStocks.com Tuesday, February 22, 2011 End-of-Day Update","The market returned from the long weekend and experienced a strong selloff with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite declining 2.1% and 2.7%, respectively. The DJIA was down less but still finished lower by 1.4%. Investor participation confirmed the selling pressure and market breadth was very bad. As a result, we are lowering the resistance levels on the DJIA (DIA), S&P 500 (SPY), and Nasdaq Composite (QQQQ) (see below). However, we are actually raising the support levels on the DJIA and S&P 500 (see below). The support level on the Nasdaq Composite was moved down (see below). The DJIA held above and never tested its 21-day moving average. The S&P 500 mildly tested and held above its 21-day moving average but the Nasdaq Composite closed below its 21-day moving average. We will be watching the 21-day moving averages closely to see if the indexes find support here or if it is going to turn into resistance. Volatility shot up today with the Volatility Index (VIX) increasing 26.6% to 20.80. Fear was evident in today's market action. The prudent approach continues to be the same as we have been saying: defense. Protecting profits and keeping losses small is the way to go based on the stock market direction. Refrain from putting new money to work. If you need to own stocks, please see our open watch list below. Today we removed the 'Stock of the Day' position in the Market Vectors Gold Miners (symbol: GDX) at $58.58 based on a special intra-day alert.

2011-02-24,A Forgotten ETF For Gold's Rebound,"When it comes to gold ETFs, it seems like all the opinions, comments and buy and sell calls revolve around the usual suspects. ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) or another comparable fund backed by physical gold or the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and its small-cap cousin, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) command most of the headlines. Quiet as it may be kept, there are leveraged ways to play the gold miners, both from the long side and the short side and they come courtesy of who else but Direxion. With gold getting a boost thanks to Middle East tensions, let's have a look at the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 2x Shares (NYSE: NUGT). Credit to Direxion for a cute ticker, but NUGT really may be a hidden nugget when it comes to gold ETFs. To make things simple, consider NUGT the double leveraged cousin of GDX as both track the NYSE Arca GoldMiners Index. Just 2.5 months old, NUGT has stuggled on the volume and due to a sell-off in gold to start 2011, but gold's bull market of 2010 illustrated the power of mining ETFs, so why don't double up occassionally for a short-term trade with NUGT? NUGT's volume has started to increase a bit and the fund has done exactly what is supposed to do over short-term holding periods, returning GDX by almost 2x over the last five days. NUGT's inverse equivalent is the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 2x Shares (NYSE: DUST) in case you're feeling bearish on the miners."
2011-02-28,Five Commodities ETFs For Q2 and Beyond,"Commodities are all the rage these days as hardly a day goes by without oil or one of the precious metals getting a fair amount of press. This trend has amplified the attention paid by investors to ETFs that offer exposure to commodities of all stripes. Even with that, soaring commodities prices today have kept talk about seasonality to a minimum. It's almost as though the market has said forget tomorrow and live in the moment. Well, astute investors know better and it often pays to play seasonal trends in commodities. And we talk about seasonality with commodities, we're going much deeper than the thesis that oil prices rise in the summer because more folks are traveling. Here's our list of commodities ETFs that could fall or flourish in the second quarter and later this year. 1) iPath DJ-UBS Cotton TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: BAL): BAL has been a freight train in the past year, surging almost 143% and like the commodity it tracks, this ETN is volatile. Last year represented a departure from typical seasonal trends as cotton prices climbed in the second half of the year. Typically, the opposite is true. BAL has been under some pressure lately and the wild intraday moves make this ETN a worthwhile trade in the coming months. The question is, and it's hard to answer at this point, will cotton keep fighting off its historical patterns or will it tumble in the second half of 2011? The USDA is forecasting a bigger cotton crop this year, but overseas demand should be robust enough to pick up that extra supply. 2) Market Vector Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): Gold prices typically get a boost starting in June when India's wedding season starts in earnest. That may seem like an odd fundamental catalyst, but the trade works for ETFs like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD). Mining ETFs like GDX should be watched because if oil prices do climb in the spring and summer, that means higher input costs for the miners and gold prices will need to rise to dampen oil's impact. 3) Teucrium Corn ETF (NYSE: CORN): Corn is harvested twice a year, first in the southern hemisphere and then in the northern hemisphere. Supplies are expected to be tight in the U.S. despite a record crop in terms of size and there have been reports of high temperatures in Argentina, South America's major corn producer. Keep an eye on how Argentina's harvest impacts CORN as that could be a tell for the rest of 2011. 4) ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL): Spring is when the big car companies really ramp up their sales and since palladium is the key component in catalytic converters used in cars sold in China AND the U.S., the two largest and most important auto markets in the world, PALL could prove to be a seasonal play, though the fundamentals bode well for longer-term success. 5) iPath DJ-UBS Coffee TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: JO): Like BAL, JO fought off seasonality to rage higher for almost all of 2010. Assuming coffee prices resume their old trend of dipping in the summer months, that dip may be the time to buy JO because coffee seasonality starts to work in favor of the bulls late in the third quarter."
2011-03-03,"Ray Dalio: 2011 Is A Sweet Spot, 2012 Much Harder (GLD, GG, ABX, GDX)","Ray Dalio, of Bridgewater Associates is on CNBC this morning. Ths is noteworthy for two reasons. Dalio rarely gives TV interviews, and Bridgewater Associates is one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. Dalio says that Bridgewater is a group of independent thinkers, and is proud of its radically transparent culture. It's because of that openess, Dalio says, that the hedge fund knows what's going on. Dalio was asked about the U.S. dollar's role as the reserve currency. He says that the dollar will inevitably decline from being the world's reserve currency to one of a few reserve currencies. U.S. equities are comparitively cheap, and the flows are beneficial to them. Dalio thinks that we will have a pretty good environment for equities, but cautioned that it's importnat to be diversified, and investors need some gold in their portfolio, and to diversify away from dollar-denominated equities. Dalio said that gold should be a part of people's portfolios. Investors can play this by owning SPDR GLD ETF (NYSE: GLD), or a number of gold miners, like Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG), Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Gold is the greatest store of wealth, when compared to currencies. Dalio says that purchases of financial asets by the central banks helped put money back into the economy, but it's undesirable in the long term. We needed that spending in the short-term however to make up for the lack of private sector spending. Dalio believes that private credit growth will slow and economic growth will slow as well. He thinks we will average around 2% real economic growth. The deleveraging will be with us for a long time. If you can print money, you're okay. That's why countries who can't print money, like Portugal and Spain, are in trouble. 2011 is a sweet spot in the cycyle, whereas 2009 and 2010 were years for asset purchases. Dalio believes we will have longer term slower growth. Dalio believes the next seismic shift, sometime in 2012, is the currency links. It's a one way street for investors because of the currency links. Dalio says that many countries have an inappropriate monetary policy. He believes in 2012, many emerging market economies will have to devalue their currencies as a result of this. 2012 is going to be a difficult year because of the need to revalue the currencies. We're competing with emerging market economy currencies, commodities, but Dalio thinks that 2011 will be a good year for equities by and large. He does believe that towards the latter part of 2012, we will see a global tightening. Dalio says that many emerging market economies will not be able to slow inflation, like China, and the U.S. will have to remain with easy monetary policy to combat this. Dalio concluded the interview by saying he's not interested in holding municipal bonds, although he admitted that he wasn't a muni expert."
2011-03-17,Global X Distills A Pure Gold Miners ETF,"Global X on Tuesday (3/15/11) rolled out a new ETF designed to target companies producing gold and only gold. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (GGGG) seeks to track an index that limits inclusion to companies that generate the vast majority of their business from gold mining. The underlying Solactive Global Pure Gold Miners Index restricts new index components to those with at least 95% of the company's revenues generated from gold mining. To remain in the index, that proportion must remain above 90%. Additionally, constituents are weighted proportionally on free float market capitalization with the largest positions capped at 4.75% each. The resulting country breakdown for the fund currently has Canada at 41.3%, South Africa 15.4%, U.S. 11.2%, Australia 9.1%, U.K. 6.4%, Jersey 4.8%, Russia 4.8%, China 4.1%, and Turkey 3.0%. GGGG has an expense ratio of 0.59%, and the fund has 30 holdings in all. The nine stocks capped at 4.75% during the last index rebalancing were Kinross Gold Corp (KGC), Anglogold Ashanti ADR (AU), Gold Fields Ltd ADR (GFI), Polyus Gold ADR (OPYGY), Eldorado Gold Corp (EGO), Randgold Resources Ltd-ADR (GOLD), Osisko Mining Corp (OSKFF), Petropavlovsk Plc, and Centerra Gold Inc. GGGG will be in competition with both Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ), as GGGG's holdings are found in both. However, due to its “pure” play philosophy, GGGG excludes many familiar names that don't meet that description including Barrick Gold (ABX), Newmont Mining (NEM), Buenaventura Mining Company (BVN), and Yamana Gold (AUY). Additional information is located on the summary page, in the fact sheet (pdf), and in the prospectus (pdf). Disclosure covering writer, editor, and publisher: No positions in any of the securities mentioned. No positions in any of the companies or ETF sponsors mentioned. No income, revenue, or other compensation (either directly or indirectly) received from, or on behalf of, any of the companies or ETF sponsors mentioned."

2011-04-02,ETF Showdown: This One's For Goldfinger,"Since the series debuted in 1962, 22 official James Bond movies have been produced. Did you know that three of the titles mention gold? Of those three, Goldfinger is probably still the most-well known and that film, the third in the 007 series, is still widely regarded as one of the best in the series. Basically, the villain, Auric Goldfinger, wants to loot Fort Knox for its gold. Fast-forward almost 50 years since the movie was made and plenty of conspiracy theorists openly say there isn't even any gold in Fort Knox. Maybe Auric Goldfinger would need to consider some ETFs if he was around today. So with that, this week's ETF Showdown compares two equity-based gold ETFs that might just appeal to Goldfinger himself. When discussing gold ETFs that track equities rather than featuring physical holdings of the commodity itself, that means we have to talk about gold miners and that leads us to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the big kahuna of equity ETFs with gold exposure. GDX is almost five years-old and has accumulated almost $660 million in assets under management, highlighting its dominance in this genre. But competition may be here in the form of the newly minted Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE: GLDX). GLDX is five months old, but has garnered $25.4 million in AUM since its debut. Gold explorers and gold miners, what's the difference? Well, the important difference to note with GDX and GLDX is the holdings. GDX has 31 holdings and GLDX has 31, but GLDX offers exposure to the more speculative side of gold stocks. Anyone that has invested in gold equities probably knows about Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), all of which can be found among GDX's top-10 holdings. On the other hand, companies like NovaGold Resources (AMEX: NG), Rubicon Minerals (AMEX: RBY) and other less heralded fare make up the bulk of GLDX's holdings. Since GLDX is more a junior miner play, it is more than 83% allocated to Canada at the country level compared to about 65% for GDX. GDX trumps its newer rival when it comes to expenses with an expense ratio of 0.53% compared to 0.65% for GLDX. Even the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) features lower fees than GLDX. The bottom line is that for investors that are simply gold crazy, GDX and GLDX combined could be a potent idea because that scenario covers large caps and more speculative issues. Still, it's usually a more sound idea to keep risk to a minimum with gold stocks, so GDX is probably the better bet for the conservative trader or investor."
2011-04-04,Gold Miners Strike Early,This morning the major gold mining stocks are holding up very well. Gold and silver are both catching bids higher today. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDX) is trading higher by 0.61 cents to $60.39 a share. The GDX will have intra-day resistance around the $60.65 area. This could be a small pullback area for the GDX. Newmont Mining Corp.(NYSE: NEM) is trading higher this morning by 0.91 cents to $55.35 a share. There looks to be some minor intra-day resistance for Newmont stock around the $55.40 area and more resistance around the $56.00 level. Traders can watch for small pullbacks off of both levels. Randgold Resources Ltd.(NASDAQ: GOLD) is another leading gold mining stock. This stock rallied sharply higher last week and looks to be pulling back today after last week's surge. Randgold stock is trading lower this morning by $1.38 to $82.23 a share. The stock will have minor intra-day support around the $82.00 area. Should the stock decline further intra-day traders should watch for support around the $81.00 area. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com
2011-04-18,"Market Decline Equals A Chance To Add Gold Miners (GDX, GDXJ, GLDX, PSAU)","Even though physical gold prices have risen in the face of the today's S&P U.S. outlook, the companies that mine the metal have fallen hard. This gives investors a perfect opportunity to add the sector. Due to the miners' production cost structure (which comes with fixed expenses), these companies can act as a leveraged plays on gold prices. Essentially, a 1% increase in the price of gold will often equal a greater than 1% increase in a miners' operating income. This gives the gold miners a unique risk/return profile relative to physical gold. While the sector isn't known for its huge dividends, ever-increasing gold prices could change that. With gold hitting record highs, many firms are seeing operating margins surge for each ounce of gold produced. Many of the top producers have cash cost in the range of $400 to $600 per ounce. As the sector continues its trend of increased profitability, investors can expect more dividend increases. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NASDAQ: GDXJ) and Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NASDAQ: GLDX) all focus on different areas of the gold mining spectrum and could be used as plays for adding exposure. Investors may also want to consider the PowerShares Global Gold & Precious Metals (NASDAQ: PSAU) as well. Disclosure: Author is Long GDXJ and IAU"
2011-04-18,Silver And Gold Continue Explosive Rally As S&P Downgrades U.S. Debt,"Regardless of whether a compromise is reached over the approaching lockdown of the United States ceiling and the raising of the debt, this impasse has momentous significance for holders of gold (SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)) and silver (iShares Silver Trust (SLV)). The serious weaknesses of our economic structure is exposing it as a paper tiger. Instead of seeking fiscal sanity, the inability of our leaders to agree on even the smallest of issues is reminiscent of the Roman Empire dealing out bread and circus to the masses when Rome could no longer afford the good times and the games. Let's look at the pathetic reality. Our legislators are unable to come up with as little as 2% of a total budget measured in the trillions. While the Republicans and the Democrats are separated by only several billions, the underlying issues are ignored. This may be because we are witnessing political theater in a dress rehearsal for the 2012 election. The actual battlefields on which both sides face one another are not only fiscal, but ideological as the debate raged over Planned Parenthood funding. The media in their attempt to sell newspapers and program time sensationalize the basic issues. Simply put, we are approaching insolvency. Our ship of state is sailing straight into a sea of icebergs. Sooner or later we will have to come to grips with the urgent reality that belts will have to be tightened. If we do not sober up to the reality of our situation, the decision to keep our national vessel afloat will occur whether we like it or not. Remember that we have to borrow forty-three cents out of every dollar that we use to pay for our expenses. To put it succinctly, 50% of our population pays no taxes. The revenues to pay our national debts are coming off of the hides of the middle class, the wage earners and the small businesses. It is somewhat peculiar that the basic truths for our survival are not mentioned. Do not be diverted by the ambient noise that tends to complicate the issue. We have been sidetracked by irrelevant issues; we are spending ourselves into a financial quagmire. This is hurting the hard-working middle class who are dealing with a deteriorating US dollar (PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (UUP)) and simultaneously carrying the load of increased tax burdens. Also long-term yields are rising and institutional investors are selling their US debt holdings raising long-term yields (iShares Barclays 20+ Year Treas Bond (TLT)). It would all be worthy of a Fellini farce if it weren't so sad. The situation cries out for solutions I've proposed in the heat of the financial meltdown, concentrating on precious metals and key natural resource stocks to hedge against a dollar devaluation and burgeoning debts. We have protected ourselves with gold, silver, and mining stocks (Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX)), which have soared over the past two years since the credit collapse. What goes completely unmentioned is the role of the Fed in the entire equation. The Federal Reserve Bank is the one factor in this equation that has the unquestioned, uncontrolled power to change unexpectedly the best laid plans. The Fed is omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent. All this time it watches and waits. One change in the Fed discount rate, one raise in margin, one change in the direction of interest rates and quantitative easing by the Imperial Fed can rewrite the whole script. They are accountable to no one and answer to no one. They can and have, if needed, print fiat money and cheap paper to obfuscate growing budget deficits. All eyes are on QE ending in June and what will occur with long-term interest rates (iShares Barclays 20+ Year Treas Bond (TLT)). As the act continues in Washington, as the Democrats and Republicans try to show the masses who is more fiscally prudent, the reality is that the Fed will have to continue printing cheap dollars to pay off huge debts. Investors realize this and that is why we are seeing these major moves in gold (Proshares Ultra Gold (UGL)) and silver (ProShares Ultra Silver (AGQ)). Let us keep a firm hand on the wheel and steer a sound course with the compass tuned to the North Star of our technical discipline. It is important to remember that the charts give us clues during this treacherous times and allows us to go where the smart money is moving. We are living in extremely volatile times and the market will play on our mind and emotions. That is why it is crucial that we become stronger than the average investor who easily gets caught up with the herd mentality. These amateur investors get aggressive at overbought levels and dump their positions during sell-offs. Remember when you invest in anything you become subject to inner feelings of anxiety and greed. You need to realize that a technical system protects you from becoming subject to the dangerous, contagious emotions of the investment community. I have unfortunately learned that what takes you months to earn can be taken from you in a matter of days. In August, I predicted a major change in the gold:silver ratio and believed silver would significantly outperform gold. On August 25, 2010, I wrote on my blog, “While I am bullish on gold, I believe investors could see a higher percentage move in silver.” The gold silver:ratio has dramatically favored silver since I wrote that. Silver is extremely volatile and has often in the past exceeded its measured targets. It is much less reliable for timing purposes than gold and could easily overshoot my late January $40 target. The US dollar is heading into new lows without showing any sort of dead cat bounce, which is quite concerning. Investors have flocked to the Euro (CurrencyShares Euro Trust (FXE)) which is quite dangerous for some countries paying back huge debt burdens and for countries who rely on exporting overseas. Do not be surprised if we see some economic weakness resurfacing in the eurozone. Click Here to get a free trial to my highly acclaimed premium daily analysis."
2011-04-20,Mining Stocks Are Still Lagging The Precious Metals,"The leading gold and silver mining stocks have recently lagged the precious metals themselves. Sometimes the leading mining stocks will lead the metal, however, they have been lagging the precious metals since mid-March 2011. Gold and silver are making new highs this morning while the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDX) is still trading below its December 2010 high which was $64.62 a share. This morning the GDX is trading higher by $1.45 cents to $63.10 a share. The GDX will have intra-day resistance around the $63.50 level. Some leading mining stocks that are trading higher this morning are Newmont Mining Corp.(NYSE: NEM), Randgold Resources Ltd.(NASDAQ: GOLD), and Goldcorp Inc.(NYSE: GG). These stock will usually trade in tandem with the GDX, therefore, watch for pullbacks when the GDX comes into its resistance level. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"

2011-05-06,Take Advantage Of Dips In Precious Metals and Miners,"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will continue devaluing the dollar (UUP) by keeping interest rates at all-time lows and continue quantitative easing as we have not seen a major improvement in unemployment and housing. We are also entering an election year in which central banks do not want to rile the equity markets. Just because the S&P (SPY) has been soaring does not mean the economy is improving. Easy money policies will continue for an extended period of time to fight against current economic weakness. This is an environment in which gold (UGL) and silver (AGQ) will benefit. We are currently seeing a massive inflationary environment globally that has caused political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, and rising costs in key emerging economies such as China and South Korea. We must be prepared for these current short-term corrections in precious metals because it will provide additional buying opportunities in gold (GLD), silver (SLV) bullion and mining stocks (GDX). The market will try to make you be complacent when you should be fearful, and make you scared when you should be enthusiastic. I have mentioned that silver was 70% above the 200-day moving average, surpassing overhead resistance, reaching record levels on the oscillators and surpassing my late January technical targets. Silver has moved much faster and higher than I originally projected. I initially thought the move would last through May, but the speculative buying and short covering has caused silver to reach my target a few weeks ahead of schedule. Whenever these conditions occur, caution is merited as the odds of a shakeout have significantly increased. A healthy correction is necessary to maintain the long-term steady uptrend and provide secondary buypoints. Major institutions raises cash and began selling into a rising market as the speculative fever reached a climax the last two weeks of April. When the consensus gets greedy, I get fearful. Since late January when my indicators turned bullish on precious metals and mining stocks, we have seen record investment demand in silver and gold bullion combined with short covering. Tremendous record volume in the silver market indicated a short-term buying hysteria. These frenzies in the precious metals markets are often followed by quick and violent corrections which we are currently witnessing to shakeout the Johnny Come Lately traders who get overaggressive in these rising markets. Investors were building up very aggressive and speculative positions. The conditions in silver have been setting up for a painful pullback. A healthy correction is currently necessary to sustain the long-term steady uptrend in hard assets. Most investors do not realize that precious metals are in a long-term secular uptrend but there will be volatility with ebbs and flows. Silver is an extremely turbulent market which exceeds technical targets and momentum oscillators regularly. Silver blows very hot and very cold exceeding to the upside and the downside. This is a chart I sent my readers April 22, 2011. I needed to be careful about this move in silver in late April surpassing my late January target of $40 and the US dollar bearish sentiment which was reaching an extreme in late April. Silver exceeded upper trend channels and saw record volume, showing signs of a shakeout. I was very concerned that silver was overheating as the herd tried to force its way into this trade. Whenever I have seen these parabolic moves, they have not ended well as the profit-taking begins and the investors who have overleveraged themselves get margin calls. I am not surprised at all about this painful shakeout. Precious metals investors may be repositioning from bullion into mining stocks. This consolidation may be the catalyst to help the miners catch up with the performance of gold and silver bullion. Mining stocks have not yet seen the speculative levels that bullion has seen. The general public is now realizing that inflation and precious metal prices will be high for some time to come as Bernanke has no plans of exiting, but are reluctant to enter bullion at these pricey levels. Miners, especially junior explorers (GDXJ) are providing a discount to bullion. Inflation will continue for years to come yet this correction in the junior miners (GDXJ) indicates the public is still unaware of the basic fundamental and growth potential of this sector over then next decade especially when gold and silver find support. This has been no surprise to my readers. I have said that there is no exit plan from the Fed. There is a concerted effort to devalue the US currency to pay back soaring debts. The US is broke and it can't afford raising interest rates. Savers are getting swindled by leaders in Washington, which has used public taxpayer money to bail out corporations and banks. Americans are getting squeezed by soaring prices of basic goods, while their hard-earned savings are depreciating. I have urged caution around initiating positions in gold or silver bullion as the trade was very crowded and at the end stages of its short-term move from late January through May. Remember, gold has a historic cycle to provide a sale every six months. As gold and silver sell off, don't forget the long-term uptrend will stay intact. Will you be ready for the next turning point in precious metals as the herd sells out during the panic? I believe junior mining stocks (GDXJ) will catch up. Some people are concerned that some of the mining stocks that haven't moved yet should be sold while they're reaching long-term support and basing. I don't believe so as they all provide leverage to falling currencies and rising demand from emerging economies. As these mining stocks sell off, I begin to look at the long-term fundamentals which have not changed. Perceptions from the herd change but the fundamentals in gold miners (GDX) do not. One must take advantage of sell-offs in gold and silver miners; they are opportunities to get on board the secular bull market in precious metals. I believe it is the best way to protect one's assets during these times of growing record deficits and currency devaluations."
2011-05-10,Market Vectors Indonesia ETF Reaches $500M AUM,"The Market Vectors Indonesia ETF (NYSE: IDX), the first Indonesia-specific ETF listed in the U.S., has reached the lofty $500 million in assets under management level, according to Van Eck, the parent company of Market Vectors. IDX made its debut in January 2009 and in that time has established itself as the leader among Indonesia-specific ETFs listed in the U.S. iShares, the largest U.S. ETF issuer, introduced the iShares MSCI Indonesia Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: EIDO) a year ago, and while that fund has done admirably in attracting assets, its $184.4 million in AUM is still dwarfed by IDX. As of March 31, the index IDX tracks contained 35 stocks covering an array of sectors, including banks with a weight of 26.6%, consumer discretionary with a weight of 13.7%, energy with an allocation of 15.5% and materials with a weight of 12.7%. Bank Central Asia, Astra International and Telekomunik Indonesia are the ETF's top three holdings. Earlier this year, Van Eck cut the expense ratio on IDX to 0.6% from 0.68% and the shares were later split three-for-one. In addition to IDX, there are six other Market Vectors ETFs with over $500 million in AUM. Those funds are the following: The Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO), the Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL), the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX) and the Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: BRF). Van Eck currently has 33 ETFs listed in the U.S. and $23 billion in assets under management. The firm is the sixth-largest U.S. ETF issuer."
2011-05-11,Dollar Runs As Metals And Other Currencies Stumble,"Commodities and major currencies declined today as the dollar shows it hasn't yet lost the “safe haven” aura it has held for so many years. The dollar strengthened against most currencies including the Euro, Aussie and Canadian dollars and others while oil and metals fell yet again, along with U.S. stocks in general. According to Nick Nasad of FXTimes, a variety of factors came in to play to the dollar's advantage. Oil declined resulting from a much higher than expected inventory increase, combined with increased margin requirements imposed by the CME. There is also concern about interest rates increasing around the world as more nations, especially China and in Europe, report increasing inflation. This will put more pressure on various central banks to raise interest rates, which in turn will negatively affect commodities. The Euro is under pressure from issues related to the support and/or bailout of Greece, Portugal and possibly others. Reaching an agreement between the European nations may be difficult due to the political disagreements along with the protests in Greece. Germany in particular needs assurances that any nation receiving aid is doing all it can to reform its practices. As commodities decline, so will currencies linked to commodities such as the Australian, Canadian, and New Zealand dollars. Silver declined today much more sharply than gold, with silver dropping nearly 8 percent compared to around 1 percent for gold. The recent run up in gold and silver may have ended for the time being if traders become more risk averse. Any interested dollar traders may want to consider ETF's such as PowerShares DB US Dollar Index (NYSE: UUP) or the PowerSharesDB Dollar Bearish Index (NYSE: UDN). Traders considering silver plays can consider the iShares Silver Trust Fund (NYSE: SLV) or the ProShares UltraShort Silver ETF (NYSE: ZSL). Traders wishing to follow gold can consider the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), ProShares Ultra Gold (NYSE: UGL) or the Market Vectors Gold Miners Fund (NYSE: GDX)."
2011-05-18,Dollars of Future Passed...,"There is so much talk these days regarding the end of the FED’s QE2 or quantitative Easing part 2 that has resulted in both professional and amateur investor confusion. Add to the mix the constant MOPE (Management of Perceived Expectations) from “B52 Ben’s” minions and throw in to the mix the bloviating statements put forth by everyone’s favorite Treasury Secretary “Turbo Timmy” Geihtner all contradicting themselves also has set the stage for the investment community to be off kilter. Of course keeping investors off balance and guessing is exactly what the FED and other players want as each has their own agenda and is basically playing for time. In my mind there is no question that QE3 is coming of course I cannot tell you at what point she will dock. It is also doubtful that QE3 would be called by that moniker but “a rose by any other name would still be a rose”. I highly doubt that QE3 would sail on in right after the end of QE2, instead we will see games played with the FED’s bloated and highly over valued balance sheet. I believe it was James Rickards who coined the QE Lite term and that is what I believe the FED will engage in. The FED will use maturing debt and interest earned to reinvest in treasuries essentially keeping the music from stopping. The amount the FED will be reinvesting will be sufficient to avert the catastrophe of full detox shakes required to actually right the economy but not enough to stave off the withdrawal pains. Instead I believe the FED is playing for time and actions have been taken to essentially create the façade of credibility so that they can jam QE3 down our throats when the economy is looking like the music is stopping again. I have noted in the past that the FED is taking a page from the French Assignat playbook of the late 1700’s that ultimately lead to worthlessness of that currency. The French economy was in the doldrums and the government printed a bunch of Assingats and the economy would act much better for a while. Going forward each time the economy of France slowed sufficiently the government would print more Assingats and things would get temporarily better, until they just didn’t as the Assignat was toast. Today we have fancy names and methods for hiding money printing and devaluation but semantics aside the end destination is the same. No different than a wife making excuses for her alcoholic husband we hear from all levels of government, economists and media that the Dollar cannot be replaced, or will not lose its reserve currency status. I want you to think dear reader about what has transpired in the last decade, no better yet even the last couple years. Would you have believed that GM could become Government Motors, or that Wall Street would be bailed out or the mortgage mess could have occurred? Would you have envisioned the changes going on throughout the world from natural disasters to political upheaval? As humans we have a tendency to extrapolate the future by looking to the past, however, this is not a correct assumption. As the 18thCentury Scottish Philosopher, David Hume posited, there is no real reason to believe that future has to resemble the past in fact it could be argued that it is an irrational expectation to believe so. In other words humans tend to be guilty of linear thinking that just because it was so before so shall it be forever. Of course the idea that the past dictates how things will be in the future is a silly notion, just look in your own life for proof on smaller scale. Take the internet for example, many of us had newspaper subscriptions and had the paper delivered to the house. If I had to guess today judging by circulation numbers that most of you reading this missive get your news through an alternative to actual newsprint, probably online as I do. By thinking in a linear fashion it would have been assumed that everyone would continue to get their news via printed materials delivered to their home, but clearly something has changed. Even the financial industry gets this concept as they constantly proclaim past performance is not indicative of future results. Yet the economists and media pundits continue to utilize linear thinking applying it to things like the Dollar, real estate, reserve currencies, US Government debt and infinite number of other things. The changes we are discussing take time and some even move at a glacial pace, but they do move. To me the move away from the Dollar as a store of value let alone the world’s reserve currency has been moving at that glacial pace. It is more akin to the shifting of tectonic plates on the earth’s crust. The plates that make up the continents are in continual motion that is imperceptible to us building pressure as the plates move and when the tension achieves its maximum it results in an earthquake. The continual drama we are living through with our economy is building pressure on the tectonic plates that hold the Dollar and US Government debt. At some point the plates will shift and all the economists, politicians and banksters who currently say that it is impossible for the paradigm to change will be wrong. I do not know when, but I do know that the paradigm will shift. There will be some event that will cause governments and people around the world to shift away from Dollar assets and or demand higher rates of interest and payment regardless of what today’s experts say. If you could travel back in time and go to a pub in England in the early 1900’s and tell the patrons that the US Dollar would supplant the Pound and that England would become but a player in the US’s shadow they would have thought you a lunatic. Flash forward to today and we have and establishment dealing with the problem of our debt and spending, and unfortunately at all levels these people think in a linear fashion and look to the remedies of the past to fix the future. If one throws in to the mix the notion that all sides have an agenda which do not necessarily lend themselves to the best interests of solving the country’s problems. Instead we have two ideological points of view both out of touch with reality that promotes each side’s unyielding view of what they want the US to be like. I can remember growing up watching what used to take place in Washington seeing the politicians sparing with each other over issues but eventually coming to a compromise and then going out for drinks after session. Today the object of the game is to block your opponent at every step and vilify them in the media not exactly an atmosphere conducive to problem solving. It could be that the rest of the world has sensed that not only are we at a crossroads fiscally and economically but they also are voting by not automatically running to the Dollar. Avoidance of the Dollar was best exemplified when the crisis erupted in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and instead of running to the safe haven of the Dollar people around the world moved in the Swiss Franc, gold and silver. Before Silver did its now famous swan dive as a result of the 5 CME margin hikes in 8 days all I kept hearing about was how there were something like 99% Dollar bears and that the dollar was to embark on a multi month rally as a result. I did not buy the premise then and I don’t buy it now that the dollar is going to run up to the 80’s on the DXY. The latest evidence I have shows that while the trade may have been crowded the supposed rally is not nearly robust as one was lead to believe. The open interest in the Dollar has remained rather flat all the time that it has been rising. Additionally, the commercial players who are right the vast majority of the time have reduced their position during this rise while the large longs have somewhat increased their position. Conversely, if you look at the chart below you can plainly see that throughout this supposed rally in the dollar that the small speculator open interest has gone parabolic. To me the fact that the small spec is fueling this rise and the strong downtrend is in place says this is nothing more than a short term bounce. There are those that argue that because the Dollar on the DXY exceeded its 50 day moving average that it is in rally mode, but just as we have seen in gold, silver and equities moving above an average particularly in a down trending bear market is no guarantee that the rally will continue. I believe instead that the current Dollar uptick is in the process of exhausting itself either at this level or by the time it gets to 77.5 near the major downtrend line (assuming that it can continue to climb) and then will resume its trek down toward the 64 level as my initial target. Dollar Chart 5/18/2011 including sentiment data and Commitment of Traders information: Sentiment indicators from Forexpros.com for 5/18/2011 and last week. Assuming that the Dollar does continue its decline then that would be bullish for the equity markets and in particular for the energy stocks and precious metals group. The sentiment in the precious metals group is at a level where the issues could rally, while if history holds true the energy sector still has some work to do. There are a couple charts posted below showing the bullish percentage for the energy sector and the precious metals. In the energy sector there are lots of names to choose from like the large caps Conoco (NYSE: COP), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Total (NYSE: TOT) or smaller plays like Occidental (NYSE: OXY) and Satoil (NYSE: STO). I personally like Statoil and Occidental as I believe that provide excellent value and potential as the oil shares turn around. Statoil is a Norwegian oil producer which like many of its brethren had gotten beaten down as a result of the current dollar rally and the oil futures margin recently implemented by CME Group. Statoil is a solid company that is currently trading at about 7.5x future earnings and is currently oversold. Statoil is very attractive at today’s price level. Occidental Petroleum is an independent Oil and Gas producer that has been a great performer in the past and is currently completing a pull back and bounce off of its long term uptrend line. OXY is currently oversold and should rally nicely with the rest of the oil and gas sector. Oxy is projected to grow earnings on the order of 52% for 2011 and looking forward to 2012 earnings are supposed to grow 16% as well. I have owned OXY in the past and it is a very good company and has delivered well in the past. OXY sports a forward PE of 10.6 and a PEG ratio of 1.14 so it is not overly expensive; and as a bonus you collect a 1.8% dividend to boot. I believe that OXY is very attractive at the current level. The precious metals are actually in very good shape from a sentiment perspective and this suggests that the shares are close to if not already mmaking a bottom. As for the precious metals there are many to choose from but I prefer to buy intermediate producers and a couple of the majors. The miners I favor once the sector gets some legs are GoldCorp (NYSE: GG), First Majestic (NYSE: AG) , SilverCorp (NYSE: SVM), Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), Silver Wheaton (NYSE: SLW), Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) , US Gold (NYSE: UXG) just to name a few. If you want a diversified basket of larger and mid cap miners then save yourself the aggravation and just buy the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). On the other hand, if you are looking to invest in juniors my best advice is to either use the ETF Market Vectors Junior gold (NYSE: GDXJ) or look in to the Tocqueville Gold Fund (Mutual Fund : TGLDX) run by long time gold mining portfolio manager John Hathaway. I suggest the two options above for investing in juniors because it is much more complex to assess the juniors that will be successful versus those that will always be just a hole in the ground. Investing in juniors requires knowledge and research that most investors do not have so the funds mentioned are a better alternative. Well that is it for today and I know that this missive kind of ran the gambit and I apologize for that, but I hope you still enjoyed the piece. Until next week stay healthy and good investing. I post this column on Thursdays here at Benzinga although I do have my own blog (monetaadvisors.com) where I cover stocks, commodities, precious metals, currencies, markets, government and interesting general observations that may not get play on Wall Street as well as subjects that interest me and hopefully you too.

I am a Series 65 Investment Advisor Representative and have recently started my own investment advisory called Moneta Advisors, LLC, based in the Boston area.

In my past I have been a stockbroker, computer programmer, Sr. computer consultant, and ran a manufacturing company; all the while I remained a private investor."
2011-05-20,Is Volatility Back?  05-20-2011,"Cusick's Corner This is expiration trade -- move on the open and then slither into the close with most traders covering their trades early. The market looks to be prepared to stay in a tight range, 1330-1336 on the June S&Ps, but if the bulls can break resistance of 1336, the squeeze could be on into the After Hours. With the Financials still lagging, coupled with today's pullback and Spanish elections this weekend, this market has few catalysts beyond the technical levels that we have discussed. See you After Hours. Stock market averages are in the red, but well off session lows midday on options expiration Friday. With no economic data to guide the morning action, some of the focus early in the day was on the sliding euro. The European currency is down .7 percent against the dollar amid ongoing concern about the debt crisis. In the US, disappointing earnings news from Aeropostale (ARO) and Gap Stores (GPS) is weighing the retail sector. SPDR Retail Trust (XRT) lost 1.3 percent. However, some of the commodities have rebounded into midday. Crude is now up 39 cents to $99.32 and gold added $20.6 to $1,513 an ounce. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 32 points, but 87 points off session lows. The tech-heavy NASDAQ is off 8.5. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) added .50 to 16.02. Trading in the options market today is busy due to the options expiration. 4.9 million calls and 5.3 million puts traded through 12:30pm ET. Today is the last day to trade expiring May 2011 options contracts. Bullish Flow Brocade (BRCD) is up and options are actively traded Friday. After the closing bell Thursday, the San Jose, CA data storage device maker reported a second quarter profit of 13 cents per share, which beat Street estimates by 3 pennies. Shares added 6.8 percent to $6.69 on the news. Meanwhile, options action in BRCD is brisk. 32,000 calls and 15,000 puts traded in the name so far. July 7 calls, which are now 4.6 percent out-of-the-money and expire in eight weeks, are the most actives. 13,800 contracts have traded through midday. June 6 calls, June 7 puts, and June 7 calls are busy as well. Market Vectors Gold Mining ETF (GDX) hit a morning low of $54.54, but has rebounded and is up 63 cents to $56.23. Shares of the some of the gold miners bounced along with the yellow metal in late-morning trading Friday. Meanwhile, options volume is GDX is 79,000 calls and 22,000 puts. The top trades were part of spreads, in which the investor bought 2,340 June 55 calls and sold 2,340 May 55 calls. The spread has traded more than 10,000X and appears to be rolling activity, or closing out May 55 calls to open new bullish positions in the June 55s. Volume in the June 55s is now 23,500 contracts. Bearish Flow Officemax (OMX) is down 19 cents to $8 and setting new 52-week lows today. Shares came under fire following disappointing earnings from peer Staples (SPLS) earlier this week. OMX also took a 20 percent hit on 4/29 after its earnings missed expectations. Shares of the office supplies retailer have now tumbled 54.8 percent year-to-date. Options action today seems to reflect some bearish sentiment as well. 11,000 puts and 550 calls traded in OMX so far. Most of the action has been in smaller sizes. The top trade is a 548-contrtact lot of June 8 puts at the 40-cent asking price. 2,572 traded. August 9 puts and November 8 puts are seeing active trading as well. SPDR Retail Trust (XRT) is down 65 cents to $52.67. Retailers are seeing relative weakness Friday following disappointing profit reports from Gap Stores and Aeropostale, which are trading down 16.8 percent and 15.2 percent, respectively. Options volume in XRT is 3X the average daily. 56,000 puts and 8,000 calls traded in the ETF through midday. The top trade of the day is an apparent ratio spread, in which the investor bought 9,000 June 51 puts and sold 18,000 June 47 puts. The position is a bearish play, as it makes its best profits if shares fall to $47 through the June expiration, which equates to a 10.8 percent drop over the next four weeks. Unusual Volume Salesforce.com (CRM) options volume is running 6X the (22-day) average, with 115,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for about 66 percent of trades. Sprint Nextel (S) options volume is 3X the average daily, with 99,000 contracts traded and call volume representing for 91 percent of the activity. Akamai (AKAM) options volume is running 2.5X the average daily, with 71,000 contracts traded and put volume accounting for 52 percent of the activity. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Corning (GLW), Aruba Networks (ARUB), and Ann Taylor (ANN). Implied Volatility Mover American Eagle (AEO) shares are down in sympathy with apparel retailer Aeropostale, which sank more than 15 percent on earnings news. AEO, which releases its results next week, is down $1.01 to $13.61. Options volume in American Eagle is 4X the average daily. 12,000 puts and 3,600 calls traded in the name so far. June 13 and 14 puts are the most actives. Meanwhile, implied volatility is up 15 percent to 46.5."
2011-05-25,No Longer Just Crazy Talk: UN Warns the Dollar Could Collapse,"On Wednesday, the United Nations warned that the U.S. dollar could collapse. While some economic commentators have warned of such a scenario for years, it has still been largely characterized as a fringe idea. According to Reuters, in the U.N.'s mid-year economic review, U.N. economists warned that a loss of confidence in the dollar would put the global financial system at great risk. The consequences of a U.S. dollar collapse may be so significant as to be difficult to predict. It may be terrible for U.S. equities, which are priced in dollars. However, a collapsing currency might mean that while the real value of equities decline, their nominal values stay flat or even rise. That scenario may be dangerous for traders looking to execute a simple short-market strategy. Gold may do very well if the U.S. dollar collapsed. Given the pressure on the euro, and the Chinese government's unwillingness to allow the yuan to float freely, gold may be the only refugee for savers looking to park their funds. In that case, traders might want to consider the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD). For a play which may be slightly riskier, investors might wish to look at Market Vectors ETF Trust (NYSE: GDX). GDX attempts to return a value corresponding to the general performance of companies that mine for gold. If investors want to observe the potential ramifications of a dollar collapse, they need look no farther than Belarus."
2011-05-26,Direxion Unveils +/- 3x Versions of Market Vectors Agribusiness and Russia ETFs,"Direxion rolled out four new ETFs yesterday (5/25/11) providing +3x and -3x leveraged exposure to existing ETF offerings from Van Eck Market Vectors.

Direxion Daily Agribusiness Bull 3x Shares (COWL) and Direxion Daily Agribusiness Bear 3x Shares (COWS) track the same DAXglobal Agribusiness Index as the unleveraged Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (MOO) (MOO overview). COWL provides +300% the daily return while COWS provides -300% (three times the inverse) the daily return. The new ETFs hold swaps on the performance of MOO and have their expense ratios capped at 0.95%. The underlying index has current sector exposures of Materials 48.0%, Consumer Staples 35.0%, and Industrials 17.0%. Country weightings include U.S. 47.9%, Singapore 10.5%, Canada 10.0%, Switzerland 7.5%, and Germany 4.4%. The COWL/COWS combined fact sheet (pdf) provides additional background on the funds, while the COWL overview and COWS overview contain links to other material. Direxion Daily Russia Bull 3x Shares (RUSL) and Direxion Daily Russia Bear 3x Shares (RUSS) track the same DAXglobal Russia+ Index as the unleveraged Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) (RSX overview). RUSL provides +300% the daily return while RUSS provides -300% the daily return. The new ETFs hold swaps on the performance of RSX and have their expense ratios capped at 0.95%. The underlying index has current sector exposures of Energy 53.2%, Materials 26.2%, Financials 5.7%, Telecom 5.0%, Consumer Staples 5.0%, and others 4.2%. The RUSL/RUSS combined fact sheet (pdf) provides additional background on the funds, while the RUSL overview and RUSS overview contain links to other material.

2011-05-27,A Look Ahead: Next Week's ETFs To Watch,"Thank goodness it's Friday and thank goodness we're heading into a long weekend. Moreover, it's probably good news there's just one trading day left in May after today because the “sell in May” crowd has certainly asserted itself this month. Stocks got off to a rocky start this week as Europe's sovereign debt woes continued to roil global equity markets, but equities gained some strength as the week wore on and at the very least, the bulls can head into the long weekend on a cheery note. While next week is a short week, it will no doubt be filled with opportunity, especially with the May jobs report looming next Friday. So let's get the weekend started with some ETFs to keep an eye on next week. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): If you're a believer in the seasonal trends of commodities, then this is the time of year to start to paying attention to gold. India's wedding season is about to kick-off and that scenario has proven to be a positive catalyst for gold in the summer months. Oil Services HOLDRs (AMEX: OIH) and the U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO): Another pair of seasonal plays as the Memorial Day weekend marks the start of the summer driving season. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were out with some supportive remarks about oil earlier this week, so let's see how long enthusiasm for oil and oil equities lasts. The Guggenheim Airline ETF (NYSE: FAA) should be one to watch as well. Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL): KOL has held up pretty well in a challenging market environment the past week or so and is now flirting with its 50-day moving average. In addition to being a technical play, KOL's fourth-largest holding, Joy Global (Nasdaq: JOYG), reports earnings on Thursday and this will be an important report for KOL and plenty of other materials ETFs. ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT) and ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL): Things that make you go hmmm: Japan's largest platinum refiner forecasts a massive global platinum supply increase because Japan will be producing fewer cars this year due to the March earthquake that struck the country. Bloomberg News broke that story early Thursday morning. Thursday evening, CME Group (NYSE: CME) lowers margin requirements on platinum and palladium futures contracts."
2011-05-31,Nine Investments that Might Pull a Jim Tressel,"In a move that managed to surprise everyone and no one (at the same time), Jim Tressel finally resigned from the Ohio State University. Tressel, whose Buckeyes won one National Title and regularly competed for the top slot, walked away after it became clear that he had covered up rules violations for some of OSU's top players. The recent situation has been a distraction for our great university and I make this decision for the greater good of the school, Tressel said in his resignation letter. Tressel was scheduled to appear before the NCAA infractions committee to explain why he denied knowing about players receiving improper benefits — a denial later proven a lie when emails emerged showing that he had, indeed, known of the benefits. Tressel's departure comes at an odd time, considering he had already been suspended for five games and an interim coach had already been named. He could have walked away then and saved himself some time and money, rather than drag out a losing hand for another few months. You might see a similar situation play out with your portfolio this June. The probable end of QE2, matched with the government refusing to announce any sort of QE3, will serve as a defining moment for a few stocks this summer. Here are a few investments who might “Pull a Tressel,” disappoint your portfolio and leave you hanging come the fall. First up on the “maybe i should get in short on this” category are the banks. If QE2 ends without QE3, financial stocks will likely get slapped around a bit this summer. Even the big boys won't be immune, which means look out for possible signs of decline for JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and Citigroup (NYSE: C). Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) is another possible target, but they have so many government insiders that it's hard to imagine them falling significantly in the long term. Second, consider oil companies. If the economy avoids another round of cheap money, oil prices are likely to go down. Rather than trying to pick which oil stocks will gain or fall, consider playing this event with oil ETFs. Three to look at are the United States Oil Fund (NYSE: USO), PowerShares DB Oil Fund (NYSE: DBO), and the Teucrium Crude Oil Fund (NYSE: CRUD). Third, look to gold. Dollars have been depressing and limp for a while now, in large part because of QE and QE2. An end to the free money policy might prop the dollar back up, leading to a relative decline in gold prices. Gold has been higher than Rick James lately, so perhaps a fall back to the regression line is in order. Consider three different ETFs, depending on your level of risk-aversion and portfolio. SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) was the first Gold ETF, and remains very popular. ProShares Ultra Gold (NYSE: UGL) is more aggressive, offering double returns (and the chance of double losses) with its shares. Market Vectors Gold Miners Fund (NYSE: GDX) offers a different twist on gold investments, by investing in gold companies rather than the price of gold directly."
2011-06-02,Five Inverse ETFs Your Broker Forgot To Mention,"For all the controversy surrounding leveraged and inverse ETFs, it's almost unfathomable that any member of this sub-sector of the ETF universe could go unnoticed. The reality is plenty of nifty inverse and leveraged ETFs are not as popular as one might think and with the broader market fresh off a May swoon (and not looking much better to start June), now is a fine time for investors to think like traders and employ some short-term hedges in their portfolios. Obviously, the critical factor with leveraged and inverse ETFs is understanding what these funds are about and it's spelled out for the world in the funds' prospectuses. Nearly every leveraged ETF out there is intended for short-term use. In other words, don't hold a leveraged or inverse ETF the way Warren Buffett holds shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and you'll keep losses to a minimum. Let's look at five unheralded leveraged and inverse plays. 1) Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 2X Shares (NYSE: DUST): Home to one of the most appropriate tickers in the ETF world, DUST is also a fine way to hedge exposure to an ETF like the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) or just be outright short gold miners themselves. Not a bad idea since miners have lagged the underlying yellow metal this year. 2) Direxion Daily India 2X Bear Shares (NYSE: INDZ): For as popular as traditional India-specific ETFs have been, INDZ has been somewhat of a disappointment as it less than $4 million in assets under management. Making INDZ's AUM conundrum even more curious has been the slack performance of India ETFs this year. Forget all that. If you can keep an eye on your positions intraday, INDZ offers plenty of volatility and great moves over one to three day holdings periods. 3) ProShares UltraShort Utilities (NYSE: SDP): With everyone and his sister looking to play defense these days, SDP probably isn't an ETF you want to jump into with right this minute. Put it on the back burner for when risk appetite and the high beta trade return. When that happens, SDP will prove useful as investors shuffle out of stodgy utilities stocks. 4) PowerShares DB Base Metals Short ETN (NYSE: BOS): BOS isn't leveraged, but it makes for an ideal play in this environment with so many jittery investors and pundits fretting about global economic growth. If global growth is really slowing, why not be short aluminum, copper and the like all in one fund? 5) Direxion Daily Russia 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: RUSS): OK, so RUSS just made its debut last week, but it is the first leveraged, inverse play on Russia and it is immediately useful. If the market bid up ETFs like the Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX) due to rising oil prices, RUSS represents an excellent option for a short-term hedge on long Russia exposure AND for establishing a short oil position."

2011-06-13,Liquidity Crisis Intensifies Mining Stock Sell-off,"Any thoughts of a bubble in precious metals is not pertinent at this time. As long as mining stocks are not in favor then any thoughts of a bubble are not applicable in the current situation. Mining stocks should be soaring in tandem with their brothers in bullion. Such is not the case. Miners are trading far below general market valuation. In past history during a bubble, mining stocks soared to hundreds of dollars a share at the same time as bullion. Wealth in the ground represents an open ended warrant on mining potential. Mines can grow, new ore bodies can be found, while bullion has no such potential open ended expansibility. Gold mining stocks(GDX) are incredibly cheap at $1500 gold(GLD). Before the credit crisis in March of 2008 as gold hit $1000 an ounce, miners (GDX) hit its all time high of $55. Now three years later gold is 50% higher, yet the miners have barely been able to breakout of the $55 range. Yamana (AUY) and Kinross (KGC) Gold are two majors that have been significantly underperforming gold over the past three years and are not near their pre credit price levels in 2008. These stocks have not provided any leverage to the price of gold to their shareholders. Investors are sticking to the bullion etf's and are disinterested in the miners. This lack of interest in this sector signals we still have some way to go in this precious metals bull market. The gold miners should be trading higher if they kept pace with the rise in the bullion. The standard deviation between miners and gold bullion has never been so great. It is at times such as these that investors can benefit from this apparent discrepancy. Currently mining stocks have corrected because of apprehension regarding the possible exit from QE2 and growing difficulties for miners worldwide. Investors who were burned during the 2008 credit crisis are concerned about a repetition of such an occurrence and its effect on a potential counter trend rally in the U.S. dollar (UUP) and long term treasuries (TLT). Small mining companies (GDXJ) depend on a readily available line of credit. Investors fear if the flow of capital were to be shut off as had been their experience in the past, their ability to operate might be impaired. This may represent a buying opportunity for investors in small miners(GDXJ). Miners represent assets in the ground whereas etf's such as GLD and SLV may have a built in weakness in the actual physical gold and silver they are holding. If called upon to produce the actual bullion, they might not be able to do so. This would favor mining stocks which represent actual wealth in the ground. There may be an implicit weakness in the very nature of a strictly bullion etf. Simply put a large quantity of bullion may not be able to be produced on demand. Do not be surprised if the bullion etf's find themselves unable to meet the demands of the marketplace. In such cases, the miners would once again come into favor as the investment vehicle of choice. At present there is a deviation between bullion and assets in the ground. Investors may be reluctant to hold paper in such a climate of fear and uncertainty. There are presently astute wealthy investors who have sold some of their bullion to purchase mining stocks. Again note that many miners are presently languishing while bullion etf's struts across the financial stage. This anomaly may not last much longer. Presently mining stocks are going through a major firesale, while bullion commands center stage. In the markets, it is prudent to expect the unexpected. That is why we should seize the opportunity to buy straw hats in winter. Such an opportunity may be upon us now as bullion etf's may stumble in the future. The gold mining etf (GDX) may be making a critical turn in the low 50's as it has broken through trend support. The technical conditions are even more oversold than the reversal lows in January 2011, July 2010 and February of 2010. A move above the trendline and moving averages may turn out to be a very powerful buy signal and signal the current correction is over. Careful monitoring of the uptrend is required.

2011-06-20,Dip Buying? Try These Five ETFs,"These days, it's hard to be excited by much in the ETF universe from long side. Unless of course you've taken to buying inverse funds, which has been a fine idea since the start of May. Yes, these are trying times, but this is also the type of environment where the astute investor can scoop up some solid ETFs at discount prices. While that's not an invitation to bet the farm or initiate large positions, the following ETFs may just be what the doctor ordered for those that are looking to buy on a dip. 1) PowerShares Dynamic Food & Beverage ETF (NYSE: PBJ): PBJ has a been a constant favorite in this space for several months, but even the defensive trade got a little crowded as the pundits like to say, forcing PBJ down about 5% in the past month. Upon further examination, there's a lot to like here. Hershey (NYSE: HSY), the ETF's biggest holding, is catching a bid on plunging cocoa prices while Smithfield Foods (NYSE: SFD), the world's largest hog producer, recently reported surprisingly strong quarterly results. For good measure, General Mills (NYSE: GIS), the second-largest U.S. food company, reiterated guidance, and in the case of all three of these PBJ holdings, if they're coping with commodities prices, that's a good thing. 2) PowerShares Dynamic Industrials ETF (NYSE: PRN): Through its exposure to Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), General Electric (NYSE: GE) and some others, PRN shares a tight correlation with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and that has not been a good thing lately. The flip side to that is if you're a believer in a third quarter through year end rally, as long as PRN continues to find support at its 200-day moving average, an entry below $30 is attractive right here and now. 3) Market Vector Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): Perhaps the riskiest member of this list, GDX and other mining ETFs have been decimated lately and that's no surprise given that they were lagging the metals their constituents mine for earlier this year. The bet here is that the scenario change and gold miners will at some point start to perform in line with gold. The risk is that there is no clear timetable for when that will start to happen. Downside risk is a move below $50. 4) Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL): A clear victim of the high-beta trade being turned off, KOL's price has changed for the worse, but the fundamentals of many of its top holdings have remained rock solid. Hey, if bullish comments on the coal sector earlier today by Goldman Sachs aren't enough to give KOL some positive mojo, we're not sure what it's going to take. 5) iShares S&P SmallCap 600 Index Fund (NYSE: IJR): Small-caps certainly helped the cause on the way up, but they've been a real drag on the way down. The Russell 2000 serves as a great indicator of fund manager sentiment and it's hard to imagine that Index staying flat if the Dow and S&P 500 rally in the third quarter. While IJR does not track the Russell 2000, it's worth a look on a pullback to the $68 area. From there, the ETF could run to the mid- to high-70s by year end."
2011-06-29,A Look At Blue Ridge Capital's Big Bets ,"Blue Ridge Capital is a value oriented fund run by John Griffin, who previously worked for legendary hedge fund manager, Julian Robertson. The fund was started by Mr. Griffin in June of 1996. Blue Ridge seeks high absolute returns by owning shares in businesses with outstanding investment characteristics and selling short the stock of companies with fundamental problems. Investment decisions are based on detailed, company-specific research with a long-term time horizon. Griffin is known for doing outstanding fundamental research, similar to his mentor, Julian Robertson who ran the legendary Tiger Management hedge funds. Furthermore, Blue Ridge's long positions are highly concentrated which suggests tremendous confidence in each stock. Here is a look at some of the fund's largest holdings. As of March 31, 2011, Blue Ridge's largest position was in Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: VRX). The fund held nearly 9 million shares valued at $444 million. Depending on when this position was initiated, it may be a huge winner for Blue Ridge. Year-to-date, VRX is up more than 85%, but has gained only 0.02% over the last 52 weeks. On the 5 year chart, VRX has gained nearly 200%. The firm's second largest position is in Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), which has been a favored momentum name for years. Blue Ridge held nearly 2 million AMZN shares valued at $352 million as of the end of the last quarter. Amazon has been a wonderful stock on nearly any time horizon since the company's 1997 IPO. AMZN is up 460% over the last 5 years and 88% in the last year. Blue Ridge's third largest position is none other than Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Blue Ridge held almost 1 million Apple shares as of the end of March valued at $340 million. The firm has likely made a nice profit on this position as AAPL shares have surged 467% over the last 5 years, including 30% over the last 52-weeks. Griffin's fund also has a substantial position in energy name Range Resources (NYSE: RRC). The firm held 5.7 million RRC shares valued at $335 million and accounting for 5.38% of Blue Ridge's portfolio. Range Resources has also been a nice winner, gaining 119% over 5 years and 36% over the last year. The fifth largest position in the fund was J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM), valued at $317.6 million. JPM has struggled a bit over the last 5 years, losing 1.52%, but is up 8.6% over the last year. The bank is widely viewed as the best house in a bad neighborhood, as the highest quality financial stock. It certainly fits in with Blue Ridge's penchant for emphasizing quality companies with good track records. The hedge fund also holds substantial positions in Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which are worth mentioning as the firm added to these stakes between the first and second quarters. Blue Ridge's position in the GDX accounts for 5.09% of the portfolio, up from 4.68% and NFLX now accounts for 4.05% versus 1.9% in the first quarter. Among other well known stocks that Blue Ridge was betting on at the end of last quarter are Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY), CME Group (NASDAQ: CME), Teva Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: TEVA), and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ: DLTR)."
2011-07-06,Gold and Silver: Short Term Pullback In Secular Uptrend,"We have witnessed an important watershed in world history with the unwinding of QE2. Every citizen, no matter where, has a ready camera eye on the world, carried in his smart phone case. Even more so does the internet provide the anvil for major nations to forge economic strategies. “Swords are being hammered into cybershares.” We think of wars being fought with soldiers on battlefields, now Cyberspace is the new field of combat. As we have seen with the uprisings in North Africa and the Middle East, the use of the internet is becoming a vital instrument in fighting the wars of the future. Cyber-spying to formulate the economic policies of nation states are an increasingly critical factor. So it has never been thus that even friendly nations may spy on one another in order to formulate their investment timing. An interesting development that underlies the growing importance of the internet in our daily lives is occurring under our very noses. Recently, an unnamed, nation state cracked into the confidential, super secret network of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF is an integral component of the global financial system. It is important to comprehend the significance of this developing story. Indebted nations are strategizing methods, in which they can pay off ever mounting debts with cheaper currency. China, who is sitting on a hoard of devaluing dollars and bailing out a debt burdened Europe, must exchange them for real assets in the form of precious metals and natural resources in the ground. History presents us with watershed events which are difficult to perceive while we are in the midst of them. This has been no surprise to readers of Gold Stock Trades. In a series of articles entitled the “Chinamese Twins”, I have identified the attempts on the part of China and America to achieve a kind of symbiosis. It is a pro-quid-pro where deals are being constantly negotiated between the two superpowers. The recent arrangements consisted of the U.S. paying off rising debts with cheap dollars (UUP), while China increased the value of the Yuan (CYB) in order to combat inflation. At the same time, the higher Yuan might purchase real mineral assets. We are now seeing the outcome of a much weaker dollar, higher commodity prices, and less inflation in China. This year the Chinese Investment Corporation, who has been given a duty to look for potential North American resource assets by the Government of China, opened its first international branch in Toronto, the North American epicenter of resource companies. It is within conjecture that China may step up its hunt for resources in the second half of 2011. Egypt has upcoming elections where the Muslim Brotherhood looks to be taking a major role, Democracy-Islamist style. Then we have the imminent Iranian Nuclear developments probably in 3 weeks. Did we forget about the PIIGS and the U.S. debt problems? There is a whole flotilla of Black Swans straight ahead that could lead investors to the safe havens of precious metals and strategic metals resources. Overall, there have been “summer doldrums” for mining stocks (GDX), gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) unless some exogenous event swoops down upon us. Although things may taste flat to bitter at this time, the aforementioned additions to the soup can serve to bestir the pot. Important reversals are being monitored as QE2 expires. The markets will do what they always do: confuse, misdirect and obfuscate. It's important for investors to stay on target and not be swayed by skewed media reports and questionable economic data, which often serve to mislead us as we make our way through the investment jungle. The long range arc of gold, silver and mining stocks moves on a maze-like path, however it should be noted that the path ascends upward over time. As precious metal investors, we must view temporary corrections with an eagle's eye, making sure to survey the economic landscape. In doing this, I see a chaotic game-plan unfolding below the headlines. At times like this, we as investors must avoid the turbulent winds that only serve to divert our course. Precious metals will remain the true compass to guide us on the path toward investment profits. Our leaders, however, are charting a different course. President Obama's reelection campaign is already on the road. The current administration seems to be increasingly concentrating on its own interests. This was highlighted by Obama's move to release 30 million barrels of emergency reserve oil (OIL). This oil is supposed to be used for emergencies, not votes. Why did it come right as QE2 ended? Is this a stimulus in disguise? We're told by the politicians that unless the national debt ceiling is raised quickly and unconditionally, the nation will be adversely affected. Standard & Poor's threatened that if the US government fails to raise its borrowing limits, they will give the lowest credit rating possible, forcing interest rates to soar and causing a deflationary nightmare. The US has until August 2 to increase its debt limit. Since 1960, it has been raised over 60 times. Spending, entitlements and deficits will increase, and the long-term upward trend in gold and silver should proceed. My firm believes that this trend of raising debt limits will continue. It's an election year, and politicians' jobs are at stake. The last thing they want is default. A lower credit rating would cause borrowing costs to skyrocket, which would cripple the US in paying back its soaring debts. Don't forget that the US is the world's biggest spender. This is the third year that the deficit has exceeded a trillion dollars. The opposition to such threats is supine and voiceless. The Republicans are accused of “brinksmanship” and plunging us into a fiscal abyss. Instead of viewing this as a major lever in obtaining important concessions from our leaders, only the “voice of the turtle” is heard through the land. Consequently, the US is heading toward a European-style centralized government, which the current administration hopes to effect if they are reelected. As precious metal investors, we observe a different vista. We sense that the “Summer Goldrums” is creating a base right here in precious metals. It is a short-term pullback in a secular uptrend. Mining stocks may be affording us with a pivotal turning point from which a profitable new rise may emerge. Miners have currently tested the key $52.50 level successfully, the 2011 low-on-low volume indicating a lack of buying rather than aggressive selling. I am keeping an eye on what may be a good re-entry point for the commitment of new funds. My firm reiterates its conviction in the long-term upward trend of the mining stocks and precious metals. Gold maintains its strong uptrend, evident on long-term charts, and many who have been calling a finale will realize that this period is just an intermission.

2011-07-07,TLT Forms Narrow Range,"Mid day and a quick look at hourly bars over the past 2 weeks shows the clear momentum of the Lazy Man 5+1(GDX). Rule#1 is “Don't Trade Against the Trend” and this chart is evidence why. The FED is selling (not buying) $66 billion in treasuries next week, which is a little less than the amount the FED bought in June with QE2. The sale comes in conjunction with Op-Ex dynamics and may create a few ripples in the trend. Meanwhile, as GDX leads the pack in momentum over the last week, TLT has formed a narrow range consolidation… a short term straddle/strangle opportunity many traders embrace (also see Tuesday's Waiting for a Break)."
2011-07-08,Check Out The Chart: Signs Of Life For This Mining ETF,"One theme that has been beaten like a dead horse this year has been the slack performance of gold and silver mining stocks and ETFs relative to the underlying metals. Even before the infamous margin hikes on silver that led to a plunge in spot silver prices, silver miners and the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) hadn't delivered returns worth writing home about in 2011. While the S&P 500 is up over 6% year-to-date, SIL is down 8.6% while the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down 7.44%. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), today's “Check Out The Chart” subject, is even worse, having plunged 9.2% year-to-date. In fact, GDXJ's June slide was so violent that the ETF actually made a new low for 2011 in the $32 area before finding support and bouncing higher. Since late June, the ETF has been in rally mode and even with a small loss on Friday (as of this writing), GDXJ is still up nearly 7.5% in the past five trading days. Now, it might just be fair to say the ETF has an interesting chart. Not necessarily really strong, but certainly not as weak as was seen in June. GDXJ is doing battle with some resistance at the 200-day moving average at $36.55 and a move above that area gives the ETF plenty of real estate to run back to $42-43 area, the upper end of which represents the 2011 high. GDXJ's stochastics show the ETF may a be a tad overbought in the near-term, but the relative strength indicator is far from signaling overbought conditions, perhaps indicating that as investors embrace riskier assets such as small-caps again, GDXJ is poised to benefit. Of course, it is dangerous to assume that gold miners are simply overdue to rally in unison with spot prices for the yellow metal. That argument could have been made several months ago and would have proven quite unprofitable. That said, gold miners have suffered some nasty technical blows this year, indicating the worst may be behind the group. With seasonal trends favoring higher gold prices right now, mining stocks and ETFs, GDXJ included, may be poised to rally in the back half of 2011. If nothing else, GDXJ has a favorable risk/reward scenario here. Check out the chart."

2011-07-13,Gold Companies Lagging Gold - Big Time,"If you've been following the gold markets, you know that something strange has happened over the past year or so. In short, gold prices rose from about $1,200 an ounce this time last year, to a new record high price of $1,579 as I type. That's a 31.6% gain. This large gain is not the strange part of the story. We know that gold is likely to rise in price in world currencies as long as central banks and world governments continue to print money in order to service decades of deficit spending. And since there's no practical limits on that spending or the fiat currency needed to finance that spending, that means that there's no practical limit on how high gold prices can rise. Before I get into the strange part of the story - I'd like to briefly explain why gold is such a good measuring stick for currencies. The amount of above-ground gold stays relatively static. It grows at about the same rate as the world's population. So 100 years ago, there was about the same amount of above ground gold per person as there is today. Also, unlike silver, copper, and many other precious and base metals, very little gold is consumed by industry. So almost every ounce that's ever been mined is sitting in a vault, in a safety deposit box, in a jewelry box or otherwise in readily available form. And though investment demand has begun to spike over the last few years, overall demand is still relatively flat. Here's a chart showing world demand for gold over the last few years: Demand stayed about the same regardless of whether gold was $700 an ounce or $1400 an ounce. So, with gold demand relatively flat, gold supply relatively unchanged and very little supply destruction - gold is one of the rare assets that accurately counterbalances currency price action. Every new $1 bill printed means that the world's pile of gold has to necessarily be worth about $1 more. You don't have to take my word for it. We've seen the money supply vastly outpace the supply and production of gold. That's why gold's price is rising. So here's the strange part: while gold jumped 31.6% in the last year, gold stocks have lagged, big-time. Here's a chart of gold's price over the past year plotted against a gold major ETF, the Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX): Normally, you might expect major gold producers to at least keep pace made in the price of gold. It's not out of the question for gold majors to double or triple gains made in gold. But right now, gold majors are lagging behind. And for no good reason. Today, I think you could do much worse than to pick up shares of GDX. As long as this fund lags gold, you should be buying. There have been very few times when this fund lags gold over the past 12 years, and all of them were great entry points. Had you bought GDX at the end of 2000, when it was lagging gold you'd be sitting on 725% gains right now - nearly double the gains in gold alone. Another great time to buy GDX was at the end of 2008, when it fell below gold's performance for several months. GDX is up 240% since then, while gold is only up 110%. If you buy today, I think you'll come close to 2-3 times outperformance over gold in the next few years. That could mean a total gain of 500% or more, easily. I hope you'll take notice of this trend, and not wait until GDX and the gold majors to make huge moves."
2011-07-14,Five Mining ETFs Your Broker Forgot To Mention,"When it comes to mining ETFs, know this: There is more to this corner of the ETF globe than just the usual suspects. You already know the usual suspects such as the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL). As is always the case, popularity is not a guarantee of returns and the mining sector is definitely an area where it pays to look off the beaten. Even better is that this approach can be extended to miners of both base and precious metals. With the latter finally showing some signs of life, let's have a look at five mining ETFs your broker probably forget to mention. First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ): Don't let the names deceive you. FXZ really isn't a kissing cousin to an ETF like XME. In fact, FXZ may just be the closest thing to a chemicals industry ETF out there because that sector accounts for over 43% of the ETF's weight. And by chemicals, we don't mean Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) or DuPont (NYSE: DD). This ETF offers exposure to a different, more obscure group of names. FXZ has been trapped in a narrow range between $23.50 and $26 this year, so buy above $26 on a breakout. Rydex S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials ETF (NYSE: RTM): Sick of excessive weights to Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX), DuPont and the like in your materials ETF? Try RTM on for size. Home to 30 familiar materials with no single constituent getting weight larger than 3.72% or less than 3.41%. Equal-weight ETFs do work, but in a taste test between XME and RTM, XME's wins by a wide margin regarding performance. iShares S&P Global Materials ETF (NYSE: MXI): There have been times when we've felt like we were the only ones singing the praises of this ETF, so it may surprise some to learn MXI has soared over 30% in the past year. View MXI this way: Iron demand is forecast to continue rising, especially in the emerging markets. The three largest iron ore makers in the world are Vale (NYSE: VALE), Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP). Those stocks account for 20% of MXI's weight. First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (Nasdaq: PLTM): As good as it when it comes to a platinum mining ETF, PLTM has suffered a similar fate to other precious metal mining ETFs this year. That is a shellacking. Gold and silver mining ETFs have started to show some signs of life recently, but the same cannot be said of PLTM. Not yet anyway. If platinum and palladium prices bounce, maybe the miners will finally join the party. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG): The newest member of the lists, GGGG is just five months old. Home to 30 stocks, the ETF is a legitimate competitor and alternative to GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) as it mixes well-known gold miners with more obscure names. GGGG's anonymous days may be drawing to a close as gold miners have started to rally and the ETF has surged 10% in the past month."
2011-07-18,"Gold Miners Soar, Are They Extended?","All of the leading gold mining stocks have soared higher over the past month. This morning, the popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDX) is trading higher by $1.01 to $60.75 a share. The move in the the GDX has been nothing short of sensational, however, price is now very extended, and overbought at this time. The GDX may trade a little bit higher, but whenever a stock or ETF goes straight up the way the GDX has it must pullback or consolidate soon. Traders should look for a pullback in the GDX soon. Other leading gold mining stocks that are trading higher this morning include Newmont Mining Corp.(NYSE: NEM), Yamana Gold Inc.(NYSE: AUY), and Goldcorp Inc.(NYSE: GG). All of these leading stocks are very extended on the daily chart and may need to pullback soon. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"
2011-07-19,"How To Play $2,500 Gold","Yesterday, gold crossed the $1,600 level and it looks as if there is no stopping the precious metal, considering the debt concerns we have at home and abroad. Many are convinces that $1,600 is the next stop on the way to $2,000 an ounce, and perhaps even $2,500 if things really get out of hand. Yesterday we saw fears that Greece may be allowed to default, and the consistent and persistent worries that the U.S. could actually default. Over the weekend, Egan-Jones downgraded U.S. debt, but no one cared because it is not Fitch, Moody's or S&P. If and when one of the three major rating agencies does downgrade U.S. debt (which seems more likely by the day due to the ineptitude of Congress), there are two outcomes for precious metals: either soaring to heights unseen before, or plunging as investors try to raise cash from anything and everything. The more likely scenario is that gold and other precious metals will soar should a U.S. default become reality. Given the fact that S&P has asked for $4 trillion in cuts over the next decade, even if a deal were to get done, there is still a strong chance a downgrade could happen. Besides a potential downgrade of U.S. debt, there are other factors happening at home that could cause gold to blow past yesterday's intraday high was $1,607.90 an ounce, before settling at $1,602.40 per ounce. The economy is weakening, no doubt, due in large part to the devastation that happened in Japan. Automakers had a tough time getting parts, semiconductor companies had supply constraints and there were numerous other factors that have caused recent economic numbers to show a weakening in the U.S. As such, we could see further easing in the United States, as hinted at in the minutes from the Federal Reserve June policy meeting. The minutes were released on July 12, and ever since then, gold, as well as silver have been jumping. If the Fed and Chairmen Ben Bernanke do decide to do additional easing, the U.S. dollar would continue to depreciate, triggering a flight to precious metals. This could potentially pave the way for $2,000 gold. Talk about a yellow brick road paved with profits. I think people are coming to realize that the economy is weakening again and the government might see a need to try to stimulate the economy further, said Joe Foster, portfolio manager for the Van Eck Global International Investors Gold Fund to CNN Money. There are still worries about Europe and Greece in particular, according to Foster. Greece is sort of on the verge of default and they're still trying to figure out how to engineer a recovery for Greece without inflicting a default on the country [and] the markets are sensing that's almost impossible, he said to CNN Money. Until the situation is resolved in these peripheral countries, it's going to drive gold. We may not see $2,500 gold tomorrow or next year, but if we see more easing and continued worries about defaults, the streets are not going to be paved with asphalt anymore. The streets will be paved with gold. Just don't have Ron Paul ask Ben Bernanke if gold is money again. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that gold is likely to continue to climb might want to consider the following trades:Buying gold miners such as Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Hecla Mining (NYSE: HL) or Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) could prove to be profitable as gold soars to new highs. If traders do not want single equity exposure, they may want to consider ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD), which tracks the price of gold. Other ETFs to consider are Market Vectors Gold Etf Trust (NYSE: GDX) or Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Bearish:Traders who believe that gold is likely to fall sharply from these levels as issues are resolved may consider alternate positions:Go long PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP), which should rise in face of problems being solved.

2011-07-20,Buy Gold Dips Because U.S. Politicians Are Ugly Actors,"FRANKFURT - Buy as much gold on any pullbacks as the made-for-TV miniseries drags on and on. The theatrics in the Senate, the House, and the Oval Office, wouldn't cut it on a high school stage, but when you got enough corporate sponsors it gets play on every idiot box around the world. It's The Debt Ceiling, starring Dr No, Mitch Earmarks McConnell, Harry I'm-Not-Gay Reid, The Big O, the insane tea baggers, and a supporting cast of hundreds of others who need to emote before the cameras. The climax will be when the uglies figuratively throw grandma under the bus and steal her social security. And there's sure to be great applause when one of the ugly actors helps grandma up, but the camera will miss it when the ugly actor kicks her back down again. The little voice in my head is screaming at me, Ramon, pedal your bike to that dealer near Zeil and get a few coins for your pocket! Maybe you've got more cash and can back up your gas-guzzling truck. I probably would if I could. Even Mr. Gold, Jim Sinclair, says the new magnet to watch is $1,764. If you somehow still trust paper you can pick up SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD). You can also look at the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). For leverage, there is the PowerShares DB Gold Double Long ETN (NYSE: DGP) and the ProShares Ultra Gold (NYSE: UGL). If you think gold has topped out, that The Debt Ceiling isn't half bad. To make serious coin on gold's decline try the PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) or the ProShares UltraShort Gold (NYSE: GLL). As far as Eric Cantor betting on a U.S. default: if he were my older brother I'd whack him upside his head with a two-by-four. As Gerald Calente says, Politics is show business for ugly people. Sadly, he's right. Maybe I better jump on my bike. If you have any new tips for me or want to send me gold, contact me at ramon.lewis.benzinga@gmail.com."
2011-07-21,How To Play A 20% Rise In Gold In 3 Months,"FX Concepts' John Taylor was on Bloomberg TV yesterday and he said that he sees gold at $1,900 at October, which is a 20% rise in just three months. Here is a link courtesy of ZeroHedge that has the interview with Taylor on Bloomberg talking about what he foresees happening later this year. After that sharp run up, Taylor said he sees gold plunging to $1,100 an ounce as another recession hits the globe, which Taylor believes will be worse than 2008. Talk about being optimistic. Taylor said that he sees the Euro going as low as $1.15 this year, and may hit parity with the U.S. dollar, although Taylor has made that call before. Taylor has been notoriously bearish on the economic policies of the U.S. and Europe, and is generally regarded as one of the best forex traders on the planet. Interestingly enough, he runs the largest FX hedge fund in the world. Taylor has been incredibly bearish for some time, and predicted a lot of the problems that Europe is currently experiencing in a Bloomberg conference at the end of last year. He has been worried about the problems of the PIIGS, and we saw today that Greece essentially has to have a Marshall plan to help save it, and even this plan may not save it. Taylor believes that the U.S. is running out of time and options to prevent a slowdown, and Europe is likely to fall with it in the coming months. Gold has long been a safe haven currency, despite what federal reserve Chairmen Ben Bernanke thinks. With a looming debt crisis of our own, gold has crossed the $1,600 mark, and if Taylor is right, could see another run to $1,900 an ounce before too long. If S&P actually does downgrade U.S. debt to AA next month should a deal on the deficit and debt ceiling not be done, then mass chaos would happen in the global asset markets, and gold and silver probably would see record inflows, inline with Taylor's thinking. Despite his considerable bearishness, Taylor has been wrong before, as he has said before the Euro would go to $1.20, and it has not hit that level yet. He is probably right to continue to be bearish on the U.S. dollar, as Bernanke and the rest of the FOMC are hellbent on doing whatever they can to destroy the purchasing power of the dollar in an effort to stimulate the economy. QE1 and QE2 have done little but raise equity prices, cause inflation, and perhaps make add a few jobs, although no one can really quantify how many jobs have been saved or added thanks to the Federal Reserve's policies. So how should you play Taylor's theory that gold will run 20% in the next few months? ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that gold is likely to soar as Taylor suggests might want to consider the following trades:Go long junior gold miners, such as Hecla Mining (NYSE: HL), Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) or the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). If gold jumps, these names are likely to do better than larger gold miners. If you do not want the volatility that comes with owning smaller miners, consider owning the Market Vectors Gold Etf Trust (NYSE: GDX), which owns larger miners, and is less volatile. Silver should also do well in this scenario, and names like First Majestic Silver Corp. (NYSE: AG) will do well. Bearish:Traders who believe that the U.S. dollar is likely to continue to fall may consider alternate positions:Shorting the U.S. dollar, either by shorting PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP), or going long PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish (NYSE: UDN).

2011-07-29,Moody's Thinking About Screwing With Spain Next,"Moody's Investors Service said Friday it might cut Spain's credit rating soon, and few in Madrid are going to be happy with that thought. Then again, it's unclear whether the idea to cut Spain's rating can really qualify as a thought, given the logic behind it. Moody's has said the downgrade would come because Moody's is concerned about the rising cost of borrowing money to pay down Spanish debt. Of course, downgrading the credit rating has exactly one outcome: it raises the cost of borrowing money to pay down debt. If this is not an epic facepalm moment (ask your kids) then I do not know what would qualify as one. Spain's current long-term rating sits at Aa2, and the decrease would only bump it down one notch. Still, why cut the debt rating now, particularly when Spain has met its 2010 targets and is otherwise recovering? Cutting the debt rating would only serve to make it more likely that Spain has trouble in 2011 and beyond. What is Moody's argument? “Funding costs have been rising for some time for the Spanish government and for many closely related debt issuers, such as domestic banks and regional governments,” Moody's said. “Pressures are likely to increase still further following the announcement of the official package for Greece, which has signaled a clear shift in risk for bondholders of countries with high debt burdens or large budget deficits.” Moody's continued, “Challenges to long-term budget balance remain due to Spain's subdued economic growth and fiscal slippage within parts of its regional and local government sector.” Spain is also, officially, on the right path. Wages have been cut. Subsidies have been cut, and voila! It's still not good enough for the banking cartel. (I sincerely hope the austerity hawks here in America are paying attention to the fact that Spain cut back on social spending and drove the country further into recession, shrinking the economy...which is what will happen here if they get their way.) Either way, Moody's isn't looking to make a move for at least three months. They just figured now was a good time to remind Spain that even doing everything you've agreed to do isn't enough to keep the vultures from your still-living-torso. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish: The continued debt saga in Europe is pushing gold prices through the roof along with other macroeconomic headwinds. There is absolutely no obvious reason why this cannot continue. Investors should have precious metals exposure through ETFs such as SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), and and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE: GDXJ). Bearish: Traders wishing to bet against Spain, could buy ProShares UltraShort MSCI Europe (NYSE: EPV), short iShares MSCI Spain Index (NYSE: EWP), or short Spanish bank Banco Santander, (NYSE: STD)."
2011-07-29,"Hello Darkness, My Old Friend","Hello darkness, my old friend-Simon & Garfunkel This morning we saw second quarter GDP come in much weaker than expected, as the economy grew 1.3% annualized in the second quarter. Expectations were for a reading of 1.7%. The real kick in the pants was the revision to first quarter GDP which was revised to 0.4% from an initial reading of 1.9%. We saw revisions to previous quarters that were so sharp it made your heard turn. The Commerce Department said the economy contracted 5.1% between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009. It was initially estimated that the contract was 4.1%. If you really want to take some Pepto Bismol this morning, the economy fell 8.9% annually in the fourth quarter of 2008, the worst in 50 years. That was not a recession folks, that was a Great Depression of a magnitude of the likes most of us have never seen in our lifetimes. The economy actually decline 0.3% in 2008, as opposed to being flat. All of the revisions included retail sales from the Census Bureau, which were not in the original numbers. In 2009, the economy fell 3.5%, much worse than the original 2.6% decline that was previously estimated. On the bright side, the economy grew faster than expected, growing at a rate of 3%, compared to the 2.9% previously reported. Despite this better than expected news, we are awash in a sea of negativity, as nothing seems to be going right this morning. It is nothing more than a harrowed mess that appears to be a rolling stone. Speaker of the House John Boehner's (R-OH) planned vote was cancelled last night because he could not get the required 218 votes needed to pass his plan. His own party is against him, and there are deep structural problems within the Republican party. The Tea Party subset is really making things difficult for the Republicans. The Democratic led Senate is trying to get something done, and Harry Reid (D-NV) said this morning, We have hours to act before a default happens. We are less than 100 hours away from defaulting, and it does not look like anything is going to get resolved today. Perhaps there will be a last minute compromise between both parties, but it does not look like it, at least as of right now. The Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury are making contingency plans for a potential U.S. default, and they are meeting with primary dealers today at the New York Fed to discuss the plans. We will see details leak out as the day happens, but it may do more harm than good, as the devil is always in the details. With a weak Q2 GDP, the potential for a U.S. default and a potential double dip recession, Simon & Garfunkel's song has never been more appropriate. At least since 2008. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that the Federal Reserve will enact a QE3 to try to save the day might want to consider the following trades:With a weak Q2 GDP, and the potential for a weaker than expected July jobs report, the odds on a QE3 appear to be increasing. Agricultural stocks, like Potash Corp. (NYSE: POT), CF Industries (NYSE: CF) should do well. Consider agricultural ETFs like PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund (NYSE: DBA) and Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO) as well. Other commodity related names should do well, such as Gold ETFs, like Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) and Market Vectors Gold Etf Trust (NYSE: GDX).Bearish:Traders who believe that QE3 will happen may consider alternate positions:The middle class will be crushed, as will the U.S. dollar, and both will be on the precipice of ceasing to exist as we know them. QE3 will kill the middle class, with gasoline prices soaring, and food costs spiraling out of control. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results. What about doing the same thing three times?Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security. We do not offer investment advice, personalized or otherwise.

2011-08-01,Manufacturing Growth Hits 2-Year Low,"Manufacturing data fell again in July, giving ammunition to the thesis that the economy is turning back toward recession. The Institute for Supply Management, a purchasing executives trade group, said Monday that its index of manufacturing activity fell to 50.9 percent in July, barely registering as growth. Any number above 50 percent works out to growth; the higher the number, the more the sector is growing. Overall, the manufacturing sector did reports its 23rd straight month of growth — the exact amount of time that the economy has been officially out of recession. Despite the growth, new sales orders were down sharply, and other numbers from the survey suggest that the current quarter may yield bad results. The ISM manufacturing report for July is a shocker and strongly suggests that the disappointing performance of the economy in the first half of the year was not just temporary, said Paul Dales, a senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics. Overall, it has been a rough few months for manufacturing. The Japanese earthquake/tsunami/nuclear holocaust led to a parts shortage, disrupting automakers' supply chains, cutting into the output of new cars. High gas prices left Americans stranded with few dollars to spend on discretionary items. Employers have responded to the downturn predictably, pulling back on hiring. The economy added just 18,000 net jobs in June, the fewest number of jobs in nearly nine months. Unemployment rose to 9.2 percent. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish: It is hard to see how this is bullish for much of anything, except probably gold. Investors could consider gold-based ETFs such as (NYSE: GLD), (NYSE: GDX), and (NYSE: GDXJ). Bearish: The stock market is starting to signal that the economy is facing serious headwinds. Traders looking for more downside could buy inverse ETFs such as ProShares UltraShort S&P (NYSE: SDS), ProShares UltraShort Russell2000 (NYSE: TWM) and ProShares UltraShort QQQ (NYSE: QID)."
2011-08-02,Gold Miners Still Lag the Metal,"This morning, the gold mining stocks are trading slightly higher on the trading session. The popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is trading higher by 0.56 cents to $57.90 a share. Recently, the GDX rolled over on the daily chart after trading as high as $61.71 a share on July 25, 2011. Meanwhile the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) are trading higher by $1.33 to 159.05 a share. This tells us that the gold mining stocks are obviously lagging the precious metal. Traders can watch for intra-day resistance on the GLD around the $58.25 area. Other leading gold mining stocks that are trading higher this morning include Newmont Mining Corp. (NYSE: NEM), Yamana Gold Corp. (NYSE: AUY), and Agnico Eagle Mines LTD (NYSE: AEM). All of these stocks look to have limited upside on an intra-day basis. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"
2011-08-02,"Hey Ben, Gold Is Money Whether You Like It Or Not","Despite claims from the all mighty Bernank that gold is not money, gold has been rising at an accelerated rate in recent trading session on concerns over any number of different reasons. Weaker than expected economic growth. The debt ceiling potentially not being raised. The possibility of default. Europe sovereign debt crisis du jour. All of this has led to $1,600+ an ounce gold that looks like a run away freight train. “Increasing the debt ceiling is not going to make the debt go away, while the debt problems in Europe aren't going to be resolved overnight, and we're seeing all these getting reflected in the weaker economic numbers,” said Zhang Yingying, an analyst at brokerage Galaxy Futures Co. to Bloomberg. Gold has climbed to levels not seen ever in both New York and London trading, and if we continue to see weak economic data from the U.S., as well as abroad, there could be no stopping the gold train. Yesterday, the July ISM data was released, and it came in well below expectations, at a reading of just above 50, 50.9. Expectations were for a reading over 54. Over 50 indicates economic expansion, but just barely. “All the ongoing economic uncertainty and fears of a downgrade of the U.S. AAA sovereign rating are gold supportive,” Andrey Kryuchenkov, an analyst at VTB Capital in London, wrote in a report. “Weak macro numbers would also delay the tightening cycle in the U.S.” Gold actually dipped yesterday after the House of Representatives passed a bill raise the U.S. debt limit and cut federal spending, with the Senate voting on the bill today. That was no matter, and gold is zooming again this morning, up another $19 an ounce this morning. So far, gold is up 15% this year, up eleven years in a row. We have seen calls for $2,000 an ounce by the end of the year. Jim Rogers, noted investor and U.S. dollar bear, has said that gold will continue to soar on the policies of the U.S. government. Gary Halverson, regional Australia-Pacific president at Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE: ABX), said that prices are “well-supported at current levels”. We continue to see strong demand, from both foreign central banks, retail investors, and speculators. In fact, The Bank of Korea bought 25 tons over a one-month period from June to July for the first time since 1998. We are also moving into the Indian gold buying season, and there is no reason to think that India, with its population of nearly 1 billion, will slow down its demand. Despite what Federal Reserve Chairmen Ben Bernanke thinks, gold is money. Just ask Ron Paul what he thinks. There are serious inflows going into the precious metal and it does not look like it is going to stop anytime soon. As such, traders need to be prepared for the precious metal to hit $2,000 an ounce, and perhaps beyond. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that the U.S. economy will fall apart might want to consider the following trades:Go long everything gold you can get your hands on. Gold coins. Bars. ETFs such as SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD), Market Vectors Etf Trust (NYSE: GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). If everything comes crashing down at once, there is no telling where gold will go. Bearish:Traders who believe that the U.S. economy is likely to recover faster than anyone expects may consider alternate positions:Since gold is well above previous highs, it may correct sharply, especially if economic data gets better now that Washington has their act together (for the moment, anyway). Shorting the aforementioned names could prove to be profitable. High beta names such as Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), Green Mountain (NASDAQ: GMCR) and others could move higher if the economy gets better.

2011-08-02,"Short USD, Short EUR, But Buy Gold, Equities, Cigs, and Whiskey","FRANKFURT - I've proven that even a fool can make a lot of money in the market. I've also proven that a foole and his money is soone parted. This morning, I was sitting outside of a café on Berger Straße, sipping on a latte and pretending my pen was a cigarette. I watched high-end branded mothers push past with homunculi in thousand euro baby carriages; I saw hipsters and bald men, summer-kissed girls and women, and everybody appeared to have a sunny disposition save I. I was thinking, Who was going to save me and my money? Wasn't anyone else worried about Greek Bailout Part I, Part II, ad infinitum? Didn't any of them see that Portugal, Ireland, Italy, and Spain were already standing in line? That there was a contest between the ECB and the Fed to see which could pump out the most paper? Perhaps I wasn't enjoying the sunshine because I made the mistake of viewing a few hours of C-SPAN's coverage of The Debt Ceiling the day before. It was as if reverse-evolution was at work: congresspersons have near the same intelligence as an amoeba. And their grip on reality is equal to that of a teenager who has swallowed a tab of acid. The Debt Ceiling was a farce because everybody knew what the outcome was going to be. The only solution to the economic problems in the US and Europe is to keep printing. It is a race to the bottom between the US dollar and the euro, and we may see a short-term bounce in the US dollar because, as The Renewable Man says, When you print, your currency invariable goes up short term. I am not interested in playing the US dollar, but an investors wishing to go long the U.S. dollar can buy PowerShares DB USD Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP). To short the euro, investors can buy the 2x leveraged Market Vectors Double Short Euro ETN (NYSE: DRR) or the 2x leveraged ProShares UltraShort Euro (NYSE: EUO). I believe I will use a strengthening US dollar to buy some real assets with my FRNs, such as gold, cigarettes, and whiskey. If TSHTF, I'm sure I can trade a cig or a shot for a meal. It might seem odd that I am contemplating going into equities after this current downturn, but it is not, if you consider that unlimited paper has to go somewhere. Don't forget, Helicopter Ben's QE3 is also coming this month. There is nothing to be gained in government bonds (miniscule interest and then, of a sudden, they will die), so paper will move to equities to keep pace with inflation. This strategy works if TS does not HTF and the gains, in real terms, will likely not amount to much, but after buying one ton of gold, there is only so much tobacco and whiskey a man can store. Trusting paper holds for a few more years, you can play gold by picking up SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD). You might also want to look at the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Investors who want to bet the market will rise, can buy SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) or Rydex 2x S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: RSU) which seeks to correspond to twice (200%) the inverse of the daily performance of the S&P 500 Index. Another bullish play could be ProShares Ultra QQQ (NYSE: QLD), which seeks to return twice the daily performance of the NASDAQ-100 Index. I will never look at C-SPAN again. That is more depressing than a depression. If you have any tips for me or want to send me gold, contact me at ramon.lewis.benzinga@gmail.com."
2011-08-02,"Auto, Truck Sales Data Due Out at 3 pm Eastern","Two key economic figures are due out at 3:00 EST Tuesday, and traders are eagerly awaiting both to see how the market might react in late-day trading. The Monthly Auto and Truck Sales figures are each scheduled to be released this afternoon, providing a glimpse into how well auto and truck manufacturers did in July. The expectations are 4.1 million sales for autos and 5.2 million sales for trucks. Last month, autos came in at 3.86 million while trucks were in at 4.98 million. Clearly, the markets are expecting an uptick from last month. But will they get it? And what will happen if they miss? The Dow is already down huge today, so perhaps good data will show up as a late-day reversal. Conversely, will bad data lead to a continuation of its slump downward today? Early reports are not very positive. General Motors missed their mark, coming in at a 6% increase rather than 7%. That could well hold the overall numbers down, considering how they are calculated. Each auto maker reports sales individually. The reports are typically released over the course of the first three business days of the month. Using the individual reports, a total annual sales pace can be calculated after applying Commerce Department seasonal factors. It is this annual sales pace that the market refers to when discussing auto and truck sales for the month. Auto and Truck Sales measure the monthly sales of all domestically produced vehicles. They are considered an important indicator of consumer demand, accounting for roughly 25% of total retail sales. Demand for big ticket items such as autos and trucks tends to be interest rate sensitive, making the motor vehicle sector a leading indicator of business cycles. In other words, if the data come in short of expectations, we may see more panic selling. However, even if they hit their mark, there is no guarantee that stocks will rise. Why? Because, as I mentioned, the market is down big...and no one can really explain why. Look at the greater political movement. Wall Street got a big win today, as the debt ceiling debacle passed. The manufactured crisis was averted. Wall Street avoided tax increases, which were on the table, and spending cuts, which mostly went to programs that help poor people. By all political measures, today should have been a coke-fueled bonanza on Wall Street. And yet, the market is down 150 points right now. Economic data from earlier in the day certainly doesn't indicate that level of sell off is warranted. Construction spending exceeded expectations, and personal income met expectations. Personal spending was underwater, but given the income data it suggests that perhaps people are socking a little more cash away for a late-summer trip. Either that, or perhaps we're due for a dip in consumer confidence and perhaps another recession. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that auto sales numbers are on the rise might want to consider the following trades: Any of the automaker stocks, including General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford (NYSE: F) Rising auto sales indicate a good economy, which could point you in the direction of market ETFs like the S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) or the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE: DIA). Bearish:Traders who believe that auto sales are down and the economy is headed down with them may consider an alternate positions:Short any of the bullish positions.It may seem risky, considering the boost the commodity has taken in the last year, but perhaps buying gold in any form would be a good idea. Look to gold ETFs like (NYSE: GLD), (NYSE: GDX), and (NYSE: GDXJ), which offer varying levels of risk and reward. Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-08-08,"Gold Takes Out $1,700 and Keeps Going Up in Asia","FRANKFURT - Gold burst through $1,700 an ounce in Asia on Monday as investors dropped riskier assets and ran to the safety of the ancient currency. Markets were sharply down in Asia in the first day of trading after Standard & Poor's downgraded the sovereign debt rating of the US to AA+ from AAA. Jim Sinclair, known as Mr. Gold, wrote on his blog that the next target for gold is $1,764 with $1,784 being the gate to an entirely new phase. Looking at a one year chart, gold has climbed from $1,197 an ounce to the new high reached today in Asia of over $1,715, a jump of approximately 43%. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Sunday, Considering the momentum in which the market went down over the last week, it is very unlikely, if history is any guide, that this isn't going to take a while to bottom out, on NBC's Meet The Press program. If there is a further selloff in equities in Europe and the US later in the day, investors should expect gold to move even higher. It might be time to batten down the hatches and buy gold, cigs and whiskey. Depending on how you see it, there are a few ways to play gold and the dollar on Monday. ACTION ITEMS: Bullish: Traders who believe that gold will go higher might want to consider the following trades: Play gold by picking up SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which seeks to replicate the price and yield performance of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), which seeks to replicate the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners index Bearish: Traders who believe that gold will drop sharply after this spike may consider these alternate positions: PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) ProShares UltraShort Gold (NYSE: GLL) Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-08-08,Are Shares Of Gold Miners A Steal At These Levels?,"FRANKFURT - Gold has hit a fresh record high today of over $1,719 an ounce, its 11th record high in the last 19 trading sessions. Shares of most unhedged gold miners, however, are far from their all-time highs and well below their 52-week highs. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), for example, though up nearly 5% today, would still have to rise over 15% to approach its 52-week high. Barrick, the biggest gold miner in the world, is actually down approximately 10% year-to-date. This is at odds with SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), the gold trust that seeks to replicate the price of gold, which is up nearly 20% year-to-date. The Amex Gold BUGS Index, also known as the HUI Index and listed on the American Stock exchange, is well off its 52-week high as well. The HUI index tracks 15 of the largest and most widely held unhedged public gold miners. Barrick is the largest component of the index, and a close second in the index is Goldcorp (NYSE: GG), another unhedged miner that has risen over 5% today but again, is also well off its highs. Another favorite unhedged miner, Agnico-Eagle Mines (NYSE: AEM), is off by nearly 23% year-to-date, and once more, that is after rising over 5% today. An investor could do very well buying unhedged miners if they believe gold will continue setting records. As Reuters has reported, Dominic Schneider, an analyst at UBS Wealth Management, said today that UBS had increased its price target to $1,800, adding, but I would say the way things evolve right now I really could even imagine $2,000 being in the cards. The chances have increased that we'll reach $2,000--the forecast remains 12-month $1,800, but the risk is that we will actually hit towards $2,000. If miners play catch up, they could easily outperform gold in the months ahead. Traders who believe that gold and unhedged gold miners will go higher might want to consider the following trades: Play gold by picking up SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which seeks to replicate the price and yield performance of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), which seeks to replicate the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners index Buy shares of Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Agnico-Eagle Mines (NYSE: AEM) Bearish: Traders who believe that gold will drop sharply after this spike may consider these alternate positions: PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) ProShares UltraShort Gold (NYSE: GLL) Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-08-10,"Why Gold Is Going To $2,000 An Ounce By The End Of August","This morning, gold crossed the $1,800 level and it looks as if there is no stopping the precious metal, and we could see $2,000 by the end of the month at this rate. There is a crisis of confidence around the world, and when there is a crisis of confidence, people freak out. When people freak out, everything is sold, whether it deserves to be sold or not. Rock solid names like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and others are being sold with companies that will not be around in three years. No one knows for sure what the earnings will be on these companies, whereas just a few short weeks ago, confidence was not fleeting. As such, when you get a crisis of confidence, money all piles into one place: precious metals, particularly, gold. Gold has soared over $300 in almost a months time. That used to be a year's move, and not all in one direction either. After S&P downgraded U.S. debt, the fear level was set to Extreme, and panic started around the world. For those who are saying this is not like 2008, you are right and wrong. You are right in the sense that corporations are in much better places than they were just three short years ago. Corporate balance sheets are spectacular. However, consumer, investor, and business confidence is where it was in 2008. You need confidence for markets to function properly. Good news, bad news, or no news, markets can handle that and function properly, most of the time. When you sap confidence, it is a very different story. Nobody believes the government anymore, and no one believes the banks. Just this morning, rumor mongers were saying that Societe Generale could be on the verge of bankruptcy. Obviously this did not happen, but we are seeing this happen in Italy, starting to see it in France, and every so often, we hear German banks being caught up in the rumor mill. With S&P downgrading the U.S. debt, it sapped confidence across the world, and markets across the world fell sharply. Besides this, we have a weakening economy, Congress has shown no inclination to act and provide fiscal stimulus, and Japan is still rebounding from the devastation saw in March. There are still worries about Europe and Greece in particular, according to said Joe Foster, portfolio manager for the Van Eck Global International Investors Gold Fund to CNN back in July. Greece is sort of on the verge of default and they're still trying to figure out how to engineer a recovery for Greece without inflicting a default on the country [and] the markets are sensing that's almost impossible, he said to CNN Money. Until the situation is resolved in these peripheral countries, it's going to drive gold. Italy, with its over $2 trillion in debt is going to be a problem for a very long time. It will be until either the European Financial Stability Fund is operational, or it is allowed to restructure its debt, and bond holders take a hair cut. There is no magic solution for a country as large as Italy, whether you want to believe it or not. When you have a crisis of confidence, everyone heads for the exit. The only door that is open? Gold. Just do not be surprised when you get to the door, and Ron Paul is the one opening it for you. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that confidence will continue to be fleeting in the short term might want to consider the following trades: Buying gold miners such as Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Hecla Mining (NYSE: HL) or Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) could prove to be profitable as gold soars to new highs. If traders do not want single equity exposure, they may want to consider ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD), which tracks the price of gold. Other ETFs to consider are Market Vectors Gold ETF Trust (NYSE: GDX) or Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Bearish:Traders who believe that investor confidence will come back sooner rather than later may consider alternate positions:If confidence comes back from some outside force, equities could soar. Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) etc. all could soar from these levels. Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-08-22,Don't Forget About This Gold Miners ETF,"In case you didn't get the memo, after months of underperformance relative to spot gold prices, ETFs that track gold miners are finally starting to act right. In recent weeks, perhaps the worst thing that can be said of these ETFs is that they are performing “less bad” than the broader market and in a display of their underlying strength, some of these ETFs even rise slightly on wicked down days for the broader market. And as we are seeing today, gold miner ETFs also outperform on up days. That's only part of the good news. The other part is the discussion on gold miner ETFs does not begin and end with the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Simply put, now is not the time to be ignoring the Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG). “Quad G” flies under the radar because GDX has almost $8.7 billion in assets under management, dominating the large-cap mining ETF space. GDXJ is no slouch with almost $2.5 billion in AUM, but there is room in this niche for GGGG to thrive. GGGG, which made its debut in March and is home to 30 stocks with nearly $3.9 million in AUM, is just starting to perk up. Up nearly 5% in the past week, GGGG's gains have been made on above average volume, perhaps indicating investors are finally starting to take a look at this unheralded mining ETF. While GGGG isn't the most well-known mining ETF that doesn't mean it's speculative. Canada, South Africa, the U.S. and Australia account for roughly 72% of the new ETF's country weights and that diversity actually trumps its more popular rivals while offering the same conservative geographic posture. In other words, it's a good idea to embrace mining ETFs with North America and Australia exposure and GGGG offers plenty of that. Investors can also rest easy knowing major gold miners such as El Dorado (NYSE: EG), Kinross (NYSE: KGC) and Gold Fields (NYSE: GFI) are found among GGGG's top-10 holdings. With no signs that gold's run is going to end in the near-term, GGGG is offering some value here as it remains a fair bit off its all-time high. A move above $17 puts the ETF in breakout mode, a move that cannot be ruled as spot gold's rising tide lifts the sails of mining ETFs."

2011-08-23,Gold Miners Retreat,"Many of the leading gold mining stocks have rallied sharply higher from August 5, 2011. At that time, the popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) was trading as low as $53.77 a share. The leading gold mining stocks are pausing today from their recent advance. This morning, the GDX is trading lower by 0.75 cents to $62.94 a share. The current pattern on the GDX daily chart remains very strong, however, after such a strong advance a pullback or some consolidation should not be ruled out before the GDX moves higher. It also important to note that the gold mining stock have lagged the precious metal this year. Traders can watch for intra-day support on the GDX around the $62.35 area. The GDX will have intra-day resistance around the $63.70 area, and $64.50 levels. Some leading gold mining stocks that are declining this morning include Randgold Resources LTD(NYSE: GOLD), Agnico Eagle Mines LTD(NYSE: AEM), and Newmont Mining Corp.(NYSE: NEM). These stocks will usually trade in a very similar fashion. Traders should continue to watch the GDX support and resistance levels as guide for the gold mining sector.

2011-08-24,Moody's Remix  08-24-2011,"Cusick's Corner No, not the Nights in White Satin group. Is Moody's serious? This is about the worst market timing I have ever seen -- a downgrade of Japan, where has Moody's been the last 20 years? Europe has been performing well into the Midday in front of EU banks getting ready to announce Q2 results. Today Financials have been the leader and the main catalyst for the major indices, helping them get out of an early morning neutral range, breaking out into the Midday. I am watching Crude closely into the After Hours, looks to be pressuring an upside breakout and still seeing the weakness in Gold persist. Speaking of weakness, the Bonds are being pounded; 30-Year down almost 2 points, which for equity traders is a welcomed sight. Scalping seems to be the trade of the day in the Metals and Crude markets and in equities high probability spread trading is strategically the modus operandi, especially amongst swing traders trying to take advantage of selling high volatility with good risk/reward. See you After Hours. Stock market averages have given up morning gains and are in the red midday Wednesday. Economic news was in focus early after data showed Durable Goods up 4 percent in July, which was significantly better than the 1.9 percent that economists had expected. Stock index futures were in the red before the report was released after Moody's cut Japan's credit rating overnight. Yet, despite a 1.1 percent loss in Japan's Nikkei, stock index futures pared their losses on the data and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was able to build gains through morning trading. Bank of America (BAC) shares rallied 8 percent and are the best gainers in the Dow after high profile analyst Meredith Whitney said she doesn't think the bank is in a mad dash to raise capital. BofA also sent a note to employees today dismissing recent speculation that the bank is in merger talks with JP Morgan. Yet, despite big gains in Bank of America shares and the strong durable goods orders report, the industrial average has given up early gains and is down 35 points. The Dow had recorded a 322-point yesterday. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 17. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) added 1.02 points to 37.29. Overall options volume is light for a third day, with 4.6 million calls and 5.5 million puts traded across the exchanges through 12:47pm ET. Bullish Flow A couple of oil drillers are seeing bullish trading today. Crude has added 51 cents to $85.95 on the heels of weekly inventory data. Meanwhile, Baker Hughes (BHI) has lost 58 cents to $55.25 and is now down 31.8 percent from the 52-week high of $81 per share set less than a month ago. In options action, a noteworthy options trade in the Houston, TX oil service company is a January 70 - 75 call spread at 85 cents, 7000X. That is, the strategist bought 7,000 Jan 70 calls at $1.89 and sold 7,000 Jan 75 calls at $1.04. The position looks opening because volume exceeds open interest in both contracts. If so, it's a bullish play and makes its best profits if shares recapture $75 through the January 2012 options expiration. Options action is picking up in Nabors Industries (NBR) as well. Shares of the offshore driller are off 21 cents to $17 and call volume is approaching 15,000 contracts, which is 6X the typical volume for midday and compares to put volume of 3,230 contracts. The top trades in NBR today include a spread, in which the strategist apparently bought 1,450 December 17 calls at $2.41 and sold 1,450 December 23 calls at 55 cents. The spread, for a $1.86 net debit, is a bullish play. It makes its best profits if shares rally to $23 through the December expiration, which represents a 35.3 percent rally from current levels. NBR is down 35.6 percent month-to-date and today's spread trader might be taking the position on hopes for a recovery of those losses through mid-December. Bearish Flow Research In Motion (RIMM) shares are up 92 cents to $28.92 and have now rallied 33.9 percent off the 52-week lows of $21.6 set on August 8. A noteworthy options trade in the Blackberry-maker today is a ratio spread, in which the strategist bought 11,700 January 26 puts at an average of $3.625 per contract and sold 33,000 January 21 puts at $1.625 per contract. This looks like a roll up. That is, the strategist is exiting a position opened on August 8 when the stock was probing 52-week lows and 49,200 August 21 puts were bought at $3.25. They're now opening a new smaller position in January 26 puts. A shareholder might have initiated the spread to adjust a hedge or protective put position. Two of the top options trades through midday Wednesday are in the iShares Small Cap Fund (IWM). Shares are up 31 cents to $68.50 and a 30,000-contract block of October 68 puts traded at $3.86. At the same time, a 30,000-contract block of October 58 puts traded for $1.35. This was part of a purchase of the Oct 68 - 58 put spread for a $2.51 net debit, according to a source on the exchange floor. The bearish position makes its best profits if the small cap fund falls 15.3 percent through the expiration. An institutional investor might have initiated the spread to hedge a portfolio of small cap stocks heading into the historically volatile months of September and October. Market Vectors Gold Mining ETF (GDX) options volume is running 2X the (22-day) average, with 171,000 contracts traded and call activity accounting for 57 percent of the volume. Unusual Volume Pulte Home (PHM) options volume is 5.5X the average daily, with 93,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 85 percent of the activity. Micron Technology (MU) options volume is running 3X the average daily, with 67,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 67 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in TIVO, American Eagle (AEO), and Nabors Industries (NBR) Implied Volatility Mover American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) is under pressure and puts on the retailer are being sold today after the company reported earnings that fell short of expectations. Shares are falling to new 52-week lows and were recently down $1.29 to $10.33. Options volume includes 19,000 puts and 3,680 calls. September 9 puts are the most actives. 11,850 traded and 80 percent of the volume has been on the bid, indicating selling interest. The contract is 12.8 percent out-of-the-money and some investors are possibly selling the contract on the view that shares will hold above $9 through the September expiration, which is in 23 days. Implied volatility in AEO has eased 20 percent to 54 now that the earnings risk has passed."
2011-08-24,A Value Investor's Gold Stock Shopping List,"I hate to toot my own horn, but when you call a gold price correction on the day it occurs, you have to be your own cheerleader. As I write, the price of gold is down 3% - and falling. I still think we're in for about a 10% total gold price correction, from peak to trough. And it could be worse than that - but not much. Now that the trend is playing out, I think it's time to ready yourself to buy some gold stocks on sale. For the record - I'm still massively long-term bullish on gold. And I'm not a trader so I'm not shorting gold now, nor was I two days ago. Why am I bullish on gold stocks? Well, the world's central bankers are playing with their cards face up. All of these fiat currencies are in big trouble, and yet, folks like Ben Bernanke are telling us that they plan to keep interest rates low for at least the next 18 months. Low interest rates are almost always inherently inflationary - and bullish for gold. And right now, the only thing in more of an uptrend than gold prices is the United States' national debt: It's funny because a chart plotting gold's price back to 1940 looks eerily similar. Relatively flat until the early 1970s, followed by a huge uptrend. Coincidence? Okay, onto gold stocks. I anticipate that gold stocks will get somewhat shellacked during this gold correction, and that's already started to play out as you can see from this chart of the AMEX Gold Bugs Index (AMEX: HUI): Now before you go googling the gold bugs ticker, it's not an ETF. It's just an index of the 12 largest publicly traded gold companies. You can't buy this index - but as you can see it's already down about 3.5% - and I expect gold stocks to continue to get whacked to the downside whenever gold prices correct. But the real story on gold stocks is that they've been on sale for the past few years. Take a look at this performance chart which plots the percentage gains of gold vs. the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): The price of gold has been outpacing gains in gold stocks since the market crash of 2008. Gold stocks took a 75%+ haircut in 2008 even though gold only retraced about 30% over that same period. And gold stocks really haven't recovered. They should be selling for a premium to the price of gold - as you can see from the chart above, between 2003 and 2008, they did sell for a premium to gold's gains. That's normal territory for gold stocks for the simple reason that they can increase their profit margins by leaps and bounds when gold's price rises. And I think we will see a resumption of that trend sooner or later - which is why you should be buying gold stocks, specifically the best-of-breed gold stocks, whenever you see gold prices dipping. Gold stocks as an asset class are already on sale. Any gold price correction puts them at fire-sale prices. I like GDX, and its little brother GDXJ as ETFs if you want to go that route. They're a simple way to get diversification in the sector, and you'll save money on transaction fees by buying these ETFs instead of the individual companies, and they actually have a pretty low annual expense ratio of just 0.53% and 0.54% respectively. Also, if your brokerage doesn't let you buy shares on Canadian, Australian or other foreign exchanges, these ETFs have a good mix of companies from those countries. Honestly, you could get fancy and buy individual companies, but when the whole sector is on sale, you shouldn't overthink the situation. I'd consider averaging into these two ETFs as long as gold is falling. When it resumes the uptrend, I think these ETFs will quickly correct to the upside - so don't try to time any tops or bottoms. Average in over the next few days or weeks and you'll make out like a bandit Related Articles: A Gold Correction is Coming How Obama's Job Proposal Will Affect Gold and Silver"
2011-08-31,Gold Is Still the Best Safe Haven We Have,"Gold may not be the perfect safe haven but it's sure the best one we have and we can use all of the confidence we can muster. Consumer confidence in the U.S. fell this month to the lowest level since March of 2009. Just to refresh your memory that was when the Dow was at 6400, the S&P was at 667 and the NASDAQ was trading at 1265. You may argue that since consumer views are usually wrong the contrarian view is actually positive for stocks. Sadly I don't share this contrarian view. What I see happening is that we will stage a nice “head fake” rally in September and then at the end of September the market will bounce around and consolidate. In October the market will sell off with a vengeance. We will see the S&P at 1040 before it's done. Gold continued its rise this week as it rose in New York, capping the biggest monthly gain since November 2009, on speculation that the Federal Reserve will take more action to spur growth. This will only fuel the fire that is already burning out of control in gold. Gold prices have moved too far and too fast. When this happens increased volatility is the normal result. Healthy stocks in an uptrend like to move at a 45 degree angle. When a stock goes up in a straight line it is never really sustainable. Despite pullbacks, I believe that gold's position as a safe haven is intact. I believe prices will eventually trend higher because of these for secular trends. 1) The law of supply and demand is a pivotal factor in supporting the eventual rise in gold prices. From 2005 to 2009, the gold industry received 59% of its supply from mining production, 31% from recycled or scrap gold and 10% from central bank sales. Well central banks are no longer selling their gold. The amount of scrap gold is falling as investors hoard the metal, which leaves mines to fill the gap. I will add here that while we have seen the gold miners ETF, GDX put in a tremendous show of strength lately and I believe we will see the GDX start to put in a strong showing very soon. 2) In the Worlds Gold Council's recent Gold Demand Trend Report for the second quarter of 2011, mine supply grew 7% to 708.8 tons but total supply was unchanged as gold producers de-hedged and sopped up excess gold. 3) The above ground supply is estimated to be around 165 metric tons and half of that is in the form of jewelry. Of the 82,500 tons remaining in bullion, 30,000 tons are owned by central banks and the rest is privately held. 4) The total gold demand for the second quarter was 919.8 tons which far outpaced the growth in mine supply. This leads further credence to my belief that we may soon see the GDX enjoy gains it has rightfully deserved. One thing is for sure. Gold has lost a big buyer recently, the miners. Miners have been buying gold on the open market to eliminate hedging positions, where they had been previously locked in to gold sales at a lower price. This was a brilliant tactical move on the part of the miners as the role of dehedging has been instrumental in pushing gold prices higher and without it, the market loses the key driver. One factor that could help is the advent of physically backed gold ETFs. Along with GLD, the Swiss Gold Shares (SGOL), the Central Fund of Canada (CEF) and the Sprott Physical Gold Trust (PHYS) they hold 1,400 tons of gold or more than half of the annual production. As I said earlier the big winner will be the gold miners. I see the Gold Market Vectors ETF (GDX) making substantial gains in the near future. Other name to keep an eye out for are the best for the breed miners like Barrick (ABX), Newmont Mining (NEM), Goldcorp (GG) and Kinross (KGC)."
2011-09-06,Gold Miners Jump Out Of the Gate,"This morning, gold and gold mining stocks are taking off to the upside. The popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDX) is trading higher by $1.64 to $66.55 a share. Traders must watch the $66.50 and $67.00 levels as short term intra-day resistance. The daily chart on the GDX continues to remain very strong, however, the GDX is starting to get a bit extended and overbought. Whenever, stocks or ETF's get extended on the daily chart they will usually need to pullback or consolidate before moving higher. Other leading gold mining stocks that are surging higher this morning include Randgold Resources LTD.(NASDAQ: GOLD), Yamana Gold Inc.(NYSE: AUY), and Barrick Gold Corp.(NYSE: ABX). All of these leading mining stocks look very similar to the GDX on the daily chart. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"
2011-09-06,"Buy Gold, Silver, and Avoid the Miners","The last year for gold and silver has been an amazing ride. After a sideways consolidation period in which silver traded at $15.00 for the first three quarters of 2010, September unleashed a move that was nearly unstoppable. From September 2010 through October 2010 silver almost doubled. I bought the ETF GLD on January 27th of 2011 at 128.50. Rather than bemoan that I came late to the party, I embrace the fact that I came at all. From February through April of the year GLD acted like a healthy stock – taking two steps forward and one step back. If you wanted a chart for technical analysis that looked like a healthy stock the chart of GLD from January through April 29th was a proxy. On January 29th I got fooled by the chart and sold out $152.39. I simply did not connect the dots that as long as the currency was going to be continually debased then gold would continue to move up no matter what the technical analysis showed. On May 5th GLD hit an intraday low of $142.59 and closed the day at $143.51. I thought I would wait for it to consolidate and pit in a base but it took off from there and for the next seven weeks moved up. I figured I had missed my chance. On July 1st however, for reasons passing my understanding it dropped like a rock for one day and I was able to buy back in at 144.05. From that day until the end of august it ran up in a parabolic move very reminiscent of the move silver made from January 27th through April 28th. I have been a gold and silver bug for fifty years. When I began collecting physical gold and silver it was a hobby. I really never gave much thought to it being an investment. It was a thrill to hold a gold double eagle from 1887 in your hands. Since 2010 I have become acutely aware that gold and silver were more than a hobby. It was now big business. Since that time I have lived by the mantra “if you don't possess it, you don't own it.” I was always a bit skeptical about holding GLD and SLV and I learned about the Sprott Funds of PSLV and PHYS, I also learned about a fine Canadian fund CEF. However, I always had a feeling that I was missing something. After hearing Rob McEwen, CEO from US Gold (UXG), speak I realized what I was missing was the underlying mining companies. I did my homework on them and I found that the best of the breed in gold was Barrick (ABX), Goldcorp (GG), Newmont Mining (NEM), and Kinross (KGC) just to name a few. Lest I leave out the silver miners there was Coeur d'Alene (CDE), Silver Wheaton (SLW), and too many to name. I also discovered the GDX which was the ETF of gold and silver miners. As I began to do my homework and learn about both the gold and silver mining companies I learned that there was a divergence from these companies and the underlying asset. Take a look at The Gold Bug Chart (HUI) below. Above you can see that this chart spans four years. While gold and silver have had tremendous runs the miners have lagged. How could this be so? I did not make sense to me. How could investors want to own gold and silver at spot prices but not want to own real wealth in the ground at a fraction of the cost of the gold and silver? Below please find a chart of the spot price of gold ($GOLD) during the same period. Please take at look at both of these charts. The top chart is a chart of the miners over the last 4 years and the lower chart is a chart of the spot price of gold over the last 4 years. They are not complex but they tell the story very well. While gold (and silver) have run up in the last few years the mining stocks have gone nowhere. After studying the reason for this divergence I found my answer. The precious metals market is manipulated. It is a dirty little secret and no “powers that be will ever admit to it but I can add. If the price of the underlying asset is manipulated, why would any anyone want to invest in companies that extract this metal from the ground? If the price of the metal can be altered on a whim this would certainly make owning the companies that extract the metals from the ground a very dubious trade. Here are a couple of examples that I saw play out before I truly understood what was going on. I often wonder if these well paid gurus who make a lot of money playing off the fears of people truly understand what is going on. The news was bad (employment was worse). This had a bullish effect on gold and silver as the U.S. dollar weakened and the precious metals drew bids, spiking the metal higher. What resulted was the miners were shorted within 5 minutes of the news causing the miners to pull back to key technical level of support. The news was good (employment was better than expected). This resulted in a massive short position being instigated against the miners almost immediately with no move up. This resulted in stops being triggered, again targeting key support levels. Both scenarios were a blatant attempt by short sellers to drive the market down and reap very large profits. Little fish like me were not invited to the party. This begs the questions: who is behind the sudden selling and is it the entity holding a concentrated position? How is it possible for me to know what will occur days before it will happen? Only if a market is manipulated could this possibly occur. There are other reasons I believe that the precious metals market is manipulated. For one, mining stocks are paper trades or as I like to call them digital bytes. As Voltaire said back in 1731, “the value of a paper currency will always revert back to its intrinsic value – zero.” As I have often written “if you don't possess it, you don't own it.” Another reason I try and avoid mining stocks is while we play “nice in the sandbox” here in America and Canada in many other countries it is not unprecedented for a government to nationalize a mine. I can think of to many countries that could use a few hundred million dollars for their coffers. In conclusion, I strongly advise owning physical silver and gold and for paper trades I like PHYS, PSLV, CEF, SIL, and for a quick hit and run AGQ fir silver and UGL for gold but after a week of studying this I would advise all of my readers to steer clear of the miners ETF (GDX) and I would advise for your own safety to steer clear of the miners. I think there are some very good and well run companies but the risk / reward does not make for a good trade."
2011-09-08,Check Out The Chart: Junior Gold Miners Looking Bullish,"In this special edition of “Check Out The Chart,” we're going back to the well (or the mine) with an ETF that we touted several weeks ago, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). As we previously noted, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF and its larger cousin, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) spent plenty of time lagging spot gold prices earlier this year. Fortunately, the charts show us that scenario has changed. In fact, a look at the chart of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF shows the ETF has cleared some stiff resistance at $38. That's bullish sign Number One. Bullish sign Number Two would come in the form of that old resistance turning into new support in the event of a pullback. Should $38 turn into new support, that area becomes an ideal entry point or a place to do some dollar-cost averaging. The other scenario to consider with the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF is that gold will crack stiff resistance of its own around $1,900 an ounce, meaning a small position in GDXJ is advisable here and now. Looking at the chart, the ETF has a clear runway back to resistance at $42. If the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF can break that area on strong volume, the 52-week high at $42.97 will fall as well and the ETF could run another $3-$5 from there. There's something else to consider: In the past month, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), which is backed by physical gold, is up almost 6%. Impressive, but the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF is higher by 12.4% and that's NOT including Thursday's move higher. Check out the chart."

2011-09-12,"Gold Dips, However, It Is Still The Golden Investment","This morning, spot gold is declining lower by $21.00 to $1838 per ounce. Gold has been extremely volatile over the past month. Many traders and investors have been fleeing the precious metal due to rumors of another margin hike by the CME Group. So far, the CME Group has increased margins for gold on two separate occasions since August 10, 2011. Traders may remember, it took four separate margin hikes in silver to cause the price to decline sharply. It is important to note that gold has been in a ten year bull market, therefore, a correction in the precious metal will actually be beneficial as the chart is somewhat overbought and extended on the larger time frames. This morning, the highly popular SPDR Gold Shares are trading lower by $2.38 to $178.26 a share. The GLD will have intra-day support around the $176.00 and $174.50 levels intra-day. Gold mining stocks are also pulling back today with the precious metal. The highly popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is trading lower by 0.72 to $65.09 a share. Traders can watch for some short term intra-day support around the $64.00 area. Other leading gold mining stocks that are pulling back include Agnico Eagle Mines LTD (NYSE: AEM), Newmont Mining Corp.(NYSE: NEM), and Randgold Resources LTD(NASDAQ: GOLD).

2011-09-21,Time to Buy Junior Gold Stocks (GDXJ),"As an analyst, I'm not only interested in how high gold might go over the next year. My suspicion is that it will go much higher than $1800. But I can't build a stable financial model and a strong case to buy gold mining stocks around suspicion. What I can build a case around however are the facts in the ground, right now. And right now, it is clear that gold stocks have been lagging strength in the price of gold. Normally we expect gold stocks to outpace gains made in the underlying metal by a significant margin. Yet today many gold stocks are underperforming. Take a look at this chart which compares the Junior Gold Mine ETF (NYSE: GDX), a basket of junior gold stocks, with the price of gold since the beginning of 2011. Over this period gold has outperformed juniors by 35 percent. This divergence isn't all that rare to be honest. Gold and mining stocks don't correlate perfectly. But over time the performance of the best mining stocks reigns supreme, hands down. So when I see the gap above, I know it's time to add junior gold stocks to my portfolio. There are only two things that will close this gap; junior gold stocks need to rise or the price of gold needs to fall. I think gold could pull back, in fact I hope it does because that would open the window once again to buy the underlying metal (which I'm not a buyer of here). But I'd be very surprised if we see gold below $1500. That's right around the current 200-day moving average, which over the last two years hasn't been broken. So rather than put money to work betting on a drop in the price of gold (would you place this trade based on the steady trend higher for gold?) I'd rather be a buyer of the underperforming gold mining stocks. And the biggest potential gains will be found in the junior gold stocks - more specifically those that have huge gold reserves that the market is deeply discounting, or emerging gold producers that are on the cusp of generating revenues. These two types of companies are, in my opinion, the best value right now. We can do better than buying a basket like the GDX pictured above by focusing on individual gold companies that are trading at substantial discounts to the value of the gold they have in the ground. The nice thing about buying these companies now is that we don't need gold to stay at $1800, or even $1500 an ounce to be undervalued - although my models do show that buying the right gold miners with the underlying metal at these prices is almost a no-brainer. When I plug a gold price below $1500 into my model and still find junior gold companies that are undervalued, there is an extra margin of safety. Naturally there are a host of reasons why these stocks could be undervalued, and that's where the follow on research begins, but starting with a 'too cheap to stay that way' valuation is always a plus. This week, and over the next couple of weeks, I'd recommend looking into junior gold mining companies. Track those that are emerging producers, and be on the lookout for companies with large quantities of proven reserves that are heavily discounted. One metric that is extremely useful is to calculate a miner's enterprise value per ounce of gold reserve - or what I call EVPO. A company's enterprise value is easily sourced from most financial websites, and almost all publicly traded gold companies will list their ounces of reserves on their website. So with a little digging, you can come up with a table of EVPOs for any mining company you want. We have to use enterprise value instead of something like a price to earnings ratio (PE ratio) to value these small companies for the simple reason that many don't have earnings at all. And that's okay - it's just a fact of life for early stage junior mining companies. They have a long development stage before they get a single ounce of gold out of the ground and bring it to market - so we have to analyze them based on what they may or may not have in the ground. And there are a few basic rules to help us do so. There are three categories of gold reserves, in decreasing order of confidence. Typically, we give a higher valuation for greater confidence reserves in the 'proven and probable' category. Next down is the 'measured and indicated' category. The lowest, and least certain, category is 'inferred'. For instance, for our small cap subscription service I recently recommended a company that the market is valuing at less than $10 per ounce of 'measured and indicated' and 'inferred' resources. I calculated this EVPO by dividing the company's enterprise value by the ounces of gold in these categories. Many gold juniors trade with EVPOs above $100, or even $200 per ounce of gold. So to me, $10 is a downright steal. This company is just one example - I've seen others as well with similarly cheap EVPO ratios. It will be at least 2 years before this company goes into production, but it has a mammoth reserve that the market has yet to assign any real value to, based upon the company's EVPO. I believe it is only a matter of time before the market wakes up to this company's, and other emerging producers', potential. And given the divergence in the price of gold and the performance of junior gold mining stocks, the upside potential for this group is well worth the investment. As always, start with valuation as a jumping off point, and dig a little deeper into a company's story to figure out why its stock is trading at a discount. Then purchase shares of the ones that pass muster, in a couple of tranches, to decrease your risk. Add a bit of exposure to emerging junior gold miners here. When the market wakes up you'll be sitting on a pile of gold that is not only getting bigger, but rising in value too."
2011-09-21,GDX Has Given Us a Nice Secondary Buy Point,"There has been a growing numbers of investing experts have been declaring that gold is a bubble: an insanely overvalued asset whose price is bound to burst. I believe that there is no basis for that opinion. Understanding why I feel this way can help point an investor toward clearer thinking about the frenzied precious metal markets. I agree that gold seems expensive. At its recent price of $1,813 an ounce, gold is off only slightly from the record high of $1,912 touched on Sept. 6. Gold is up more than 40% over the past year, largely on fears that paper currencies like the dollar won't retain their value. While many investors are saying that gold is overvalued I do not agree. Until the central banks stop the printing of fiat money the price of gold will continue to rise. There are people who say gold is in a bubble. This is not something I agree with. A bubble occurs when the price of the underlying asset is not supported by the value of the asset. As long as the central banks continue to print fiat paper currency I think gold is heading for $2,500, $5,000 or even $10,000 an ounce. What the teachings of Martin Armstrong have taught us is that gold is the mean or the standard around which all currencies dance or float as they are worth more in times of deflation (like now) and less in times of inflation. I don't know how to determine the fundamental value of gold and I don't believe anyone else who can but there is one aspect of gold investing where it is possible to make rational estimates of value. The stocks of gold-mining companies by historical standards seem cheap. This is based not on subjective forecasts of continuing printing of fiat paper money but rather on objective measures of stock-market valuation. I believe we haven't seen low valuations like this since 2008. Financially, gold miners have never been in better shape. A look at the Market Vectors Gold Miners exchange-traded fund (NYSE: GDX) which holds 30 gold mining stocks will bear out this thesis. Several big gold-mining companies—among them, Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM)—are trading around 14 times their earnings over the past four quarters, virtually matching the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ($SPX) at 14.5 times earnings. Even with gold at record highs, the shares of gold miners are trading at an industry wide average of roughly 18 times earnings, at 2.4 times book or asset value (versus 2.0 times for the overall stock market) and at one of the lowest ratios on record to the price of the metal itself. Yet mining companies have rarely if ever been more profitable, and should be able to generate high returns so long as gold stays above $1,500 or $1,600. Gold stocks aren't a low-risk play. Like the metal itself, they can burn you, especially if you expect to get rich quick. Gold mining has been the classic boom-bust industry, with managements squandering money on acquisitions and bad investments during the fat years and retrenching during the lean years. This is why I recommend buying the GDX ETF. GDX holds 30 of the top gold mining companies in the world. The risk of a bad move by one company is spread out so a bad decision by one company is spread out. I only see upside potential in the GDX. Please see the chart below. As you can see from this chart GDX had a hard time breaking the $55.00 level. I can only assume that this was due to the human emotion that people would rather hold gold above the ground rather than hold real wealth in the ground. Once GDX broke $55.00 it ran up to over $60.00 and gave $55.00 one more test but then moved quickly up along with the price of gold. This is because the valuations of extracting gold from the ground were so compelling that the miners finally had their day. With the average cost of extracting and ounce of gold from the ground at under $900.00 the margins are simply too compelling to ignore. I believe that GDX has given us a nice secondary buy point – one we are not likely to see again. If you do not yet have a position in GDX I suggest you open a small position here and wait because gold may still pull back a bit more. If you can buy this ETF for $62.00 or less it's a great buy and I will be adding to my position if it pulls back to that level."
2011-09-27,Precious Metals Shine Early,"This morning, the precious metals are all trading sharply higher. The catalyst for the rally in gold and silver is the European Union bailout plan. Traders should be aware that if this European Union bailout plan turns out to be a hoax the major stock indexes and the precious metals could decline again. At this time, the move higher in the precious metals are signaling inflation in the markets and the economy. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) are trading higher by $3.90 to $161.55 a share. Traders should watch for intra-day resistance around the $162.00 and $164.50 levels. The intra-day support levels for the GLD will be around the $158.00 area. Silver is also trading sharply higher this morning. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) is trading higher by $1.81 to $31.58 a share. Traders can watch for intra-day resistance around the $32.00 and $32.50 levels. The SLV will have intra-day support around the $29.75 area. Many of the leading gold mining stocks are trading higher. The popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is trading higher by $1.28 to $58.61 a share.

2011-09-29,"It's End-of-the-Month, Take Out the Garbage  09-29-2011","Cusick's Corner Volatility. Today's whippy action reminds us why we should trade with tight parameters, scale down size and define risk which is why I focus on spreads. We saw early in today's session window dressing, end of the month marks, and sector rotation out of Tech. I already mentioned that Financials have gained some steam but this will develop over time, so I am considering scaling into positions in this space. I did not like the lack of conviction near the close. Some stocks/commodities, specifically XLF & SLV, could be in some short-term choppy trade and I am looking to position accordingly, i.e. butterflies & in-the-money debit spreads. See you Midday. Stocks finished mixed Thursday. After a 180-point loss in the Dow Jones Industrial Average the day before, the tone of trading was a bit more upbeat this morning after German officials supported Chancellor Angela Merkel in approving a larger Eurozone bailout package. The euro edged higher against the buck and stock market averages posted modest gains across much of Europe. The day's domestic economic news helped as well after the Labor Department reported that filings for jobless benefits decreased by 37,000 to 391,000 in the week ended 9/24. Economists were expecting a much smaller decline of 9,000. Separate data showed third quarter GDP at a 1.3 percent annual rate, and .1 percent better-than-expected. Meanwhile, Pending Homes Sales fell 1.2 percent in August and .3 percent less than expected. However, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average had rallied more than 200 points in morning trading, the NASDAQ was lagging. A number of widely held NASDAQ names like Research In Motion (RIMM), Netflix (NFLX), and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) moved lower on the session. Baidu.com (BIDU) and several other names fell on reports the SEC and DOJ is looking into accounting irregularities at some US-listed Chinese firms. At the same time, end-of-quarter position squaring and sector rotation seemed to favor the Blue Chips. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied for a 143-point gain, but the tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 10.8 points. Bullish Kinross Gold (KGC) saw unusual options action today. Shares gained 7 cents to $14.43 after gold battled back from recent losses and added $2.1 to $1,618.2. KGC has been reeling along with the yellow metal so far in September and is down 16.5 percent month-to-date. Some players in the options market seem to be anticipating a rebound in Kinross shares, however, as options volume surged to 3.5X the average daily. 52,000 calls and 4,670 puts traded on the gold miner today. November 14 calls saw the most volume. 34,000 traded, mostly in smaller sizes. The top trade was a 617-lot at $1.54 per contract. October 15, November 15 and November 18 calls on KGC saw brisk trading today as well. The company announced after the close of trading an investment in White Bear Resources, but it isn't clear whether the surge in bullish options activity is related to this news item. There are no other headlines on the ticker today. Bullish trading was also seen in Lear (LEA), Sonus Networks (SONS), and New York Bancorp (NYB). Bearish Bearish activity was detected in Spreadtrum Communications (SPRD) today. Shares lost $2.06 to $16.75, as many US-listed Chinese companies took it on the chin amid reports that regulators are scrutinizing companies related to accounting issues. SPRD was hammered in late-June and hit a low of $8.59 in volatile trading after Muddy Waters wrote a critical note about the Chinese chipmaker's financials. Those worries apparently resurfaced today, as shares fell sharply and options volume on the stock hit 2.5X the daily average. 6,000 puts and 1,300 calls traded in the name. October 16 puts, which are now 4.5 percent OTM and expiring in 22 days, were the most actives. 1,225 traded. October 15 and 17 puts were active as well. Meanwhile, implied volatility in SPDR jumped 41 percent and is now elevated at 111.5 percent. Bearish trading was also seen in Focus Media (FMCN), DELL, and Sony (SNE). Index Trading Trading has slowed in the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) options pit heading into the final day of the third quarter - which is tomorrow. The market's fear gauge lost 2.24 points to 38.83 after the S&P 500 added 9.34 points to 1,160.40. Options volume in the VIX today was 105,000 calls and 106,000 puts, or about half the recent average daily volume, according to Trade Alert data. One of the top trades of the day was an apparent strangle purchase, in which 3,000 December 25 puts traded at the $1 asking price and 3,000 December 55 calls at the $1.35 asking price. VIX was near 40 at the time and almost precisely midway between the two strike prices. So the strangle purchase might be a make or break play on volatility. That is, the investor is betting that VIX will either: make a substantial move lower or see a big spike during the historically volatile month of October. It's a volatility play on the volatility index. ETF Action An interesting spread trades in the Market Vectors Gold Mining ETF (GDX) Thursday. Shares added 49 cents to $55.03 and one investor apparently bought 25,000 November 65 calls on the fund at 92 cents and sold 50,000 November 70 calls at 15 cents. This massive Nov 65 - 70 (1X2) call ratio spread, for a 62-cent net debit, appears to be a new position because volume exceeds open interest in both contracts. If so, it's an aggressive play with an upside breakeven (excluding transaction costs) at $65.62 at the expiration, which represents a 19.2 percent rally in the fund over the next 50 days. There is additional risk to the upside because only half of the 70s, which were sold, are covered by the 65s, which were bought. The best profits happen if GDX settles at $70 at the November expiration, or 27.2 percent above current levels. This ETF holds shares of leading gold mining companies and is down 17.8 percent from a 52-week high near $67 set three weeks ago."
2011-10-07,Mind The Gap: 5 ETFs With Technical Gaps to Fill,"For those that are fans of technical analysis, prevailing wisdom holds that most gaps, up or down, get filled at some point. For those are long the market, that's good news because plenty of ETFs are currently sporting nasty down gaps on their charts that need to be filled. Some of the gaps are especially nasty, but if the market can legitimize its recent bounce, then the following list of potential gap-fillers could prove very profitable indeed. iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV): Thank you CME Group! Thanks to a rising dollar and selling pressure induced by margin hikes, the iShares Silver Trust, the largest physically-backed silver ETF, has not one, but two gaps. If SLV can break resistance just below $32, the ETF can probably fill the gap from there to $35. The $35-$38 gap could be trickier, but when traders embrace silver, they do so in a big way, so SLV's chances of filling both gaps are at least decent. Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL): Do you see a theme developing here? Like SLV, the Global X Silver Miners ETF has some gap-filling to do, but of a more modest nature. If SIL can make it back to $24, which it will only do if SLV is going higher, than the miners ETF will fill the gap back to $26. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): The theme gets extended here as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF has a wicked gap to fill, at least in terms of how much work on a dollar basis the ETF needs to do to fill its gap. The gap down occurred in September from just over $64 to $61. That doesn't sound bad, but the gap created more selling pressure, but with GDX trading below $55, filling this gap won't be a piece of cake. On the other hand, GDX is volatile for an unleveraged ETF and its swings are big enough that this gap could be filled before the end of the year. Global X FTSE Colombia 20 ETF (NYSE: GXG): Gaps don't always have to be big in dollar terms to be hard to fill. GXG might see that theory prove true in its attempts to fill small gap back to $19.50 from $19. We actually like GXG's chances because Colombia's fundamentals are still compared to the rest of Latin America. We're not saying GXG is going to add 20% from here, but filling the gap is quite possible in the near-term. Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX): Like SLV, the Market Vectors Russia ETF has two gaps to fill. The first is small, to around $28 from the $27 area, but that will require resistance breaking at $26. The next gap is from $32.50 to $34. That will require passing two moving averages and large percentage move from current levels. RSX's first gap is attainable, but the second one will take far longer to fill."
2011-10-10,Five Critical ETFs For Earnings Season,"Here we go again. We're in the throes of another earnings season as several S&P 500 constituents have already reported, but Dow component Alcoa (NYSE: AA) will really get the ball rolling Tuesday after the market closes. Questions linger. Will third-quarter earnings season trump macroeconomic headlines, especially those from Europe? Will there be any noteworthy surprises that portend a fourth-quarter rally? Of course, there are other mysteries that need solving, too. Arm yourself with a list of some of the critical ETFs to watch and trade this earnings season. Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF): XLF's chart is a mess and the individual stories for the ETF's constituents aren't much brighter. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) gets bank earnings season started on Wednesday and next week will bring an avalanche of reports from XLF members. Investors in the financial services sector are so starved for good news that the slightest hint of it could boost XLF. More concerning headlines probably drive a near-term nail in the coffin of this fund. iShares Dow Jones U.S. Oil Equipment Index Fund (NYSE: IEZ): For the very patient among us, the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Oil Equipment Index Fund is trading at a very tempting price. That $48 and change could easily be $70 in the six months assuming a significant turn in market sentiment. Halliburton (NYSE: HAL), Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) and some other IEZ components report next week and those reports could set the tenor for the entire oil services group this earnings season. What's important here is these companies proving they're seeing growth outside of the North American shale market. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF has a long road ahead of it if it wants to get back to its 52-week high before year end. That $10 move isn't impossible if gold prices keep moving higher AND GDX's constituents deliver bullish Q4 and 2012 guidance and production and gold prices. Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK): When Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) accounts for over 14% of an ETF's weight, that means this is one to watch this earnings season as investors will be anxious to see what life will be like following the death of the iconic Steve Jobs. Google (Nasdaq: GOOG), another top-10 XLK member, reports this Thursday after the close. Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI): We're watching XLI and hoping for positive upside surprises and strong guidance from the following highly economically sensitive companies: Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), 3M (NYSE: MMM) and Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP). If the trifecta hits, XLI and the broader market will be rallying hard into year-end."
2011-10-13,"Gold Miners Dip, What Does This Mean?","This morning, the leading gold mining stocks are declining lower. It seems that gold and the leading gold mining stocks have begun to trade right along with the major stock market indexes once again. If you look at the popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) you will see that the GDX made a low on October 4, 2011 at $50.42 a share. This is the same day that the major stock indexes made a low as well. Since that day the GDX has rallied higher with the major stock indexes. This tells us that the gold miners are signaling inflation and deflation. Today the GDX is trading lower by $1.32 to $56.09 a share. This move is coinciding with a dip in the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The GDX will have some short term intra-day support around the $55.00 area. Other leading gold miners that are declining today include Randgold Resources Ltd (NASDAQ: GOLD), Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE: AUY), Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE: NEM), and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE: AEM). Traders should follow the major stock indexes closely as the gold miners seem to be inflating and deflating with the major markets. A stronger U.S. Dollar Index will usually cause the gold miners to be weak. This action is telling us that there is deflation in this market place, however, the central banks will try and combat that by trying to keep the currencies such as the U.S. Dollar weak.

Always consult with your qualified financial adviser before making any investment decisions.“Allmen see these tactics whereby I conquer, but what noneCan seeis the strategy out of which victory is evolved.”--Sun Tzu—TheDowJones industrial average jumped 208 points Thursday after Greece scrapped areferendum on unpopular budget cuts and the EuropeanCentral Bank unexpectedly cut interest rates. It was the second straightday of big gains in the stock market.TheEuropean Central Bank surprised markets by cutting its benchmark interest ratea quarter of a percentage point, to 1.25 percent. The bank had increased itskey rate twice this year, but that was before MarioDraghi took over as head of the bank this week. The announcement sentstocks higher as investors hoped that lowering borrowing costs would helpprevent a recession in Europe. Buyingintensified in the early afternoon after GreekPrime Minister George Papandreou abandoned his effort to put package ofausterity measures to a public vote. A “no” vote could have caused chaos in theEuropean and global financial system by leading to a messy default on Greece'sdebt.Investorsand other European nations were shocked by Papandreou's announcement Mondaythat he would call a referendum on a financial rescue package worked out justlast week after months of negotiations between Greece and its internationallenders.TheDow lost 573 points the first two days of this week as investors feared thatEurope's plan to preserve its currency union was in jeopardy. Markets in theU.S. and Europe have been highly sensitive to headlines out of Europe asleaders there try to avoid a financial calamity. Investors have become fatiguedas various efforts to resolve the situation seem to continually run intotrouble.Todayit looks like a deal in Europe is more likely and that's making the marketpositive, but who knows what people will think tomorrow.**************************************************************Before I begin my essay ongold I must add that if Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou had put his package of austeritymeasures to a public vote, a “no” vote could have caused chaos in the Europeanand global financial system and gold would havegone parabolic. By abandoning his effort to put package of austerity measures to apublic vote and making it seem like it was the will of the government gold willsimply continue to rise. Gold is again being seen in Greece as anessential store of wealth, hedge against inflation and safehaven asset. This is not surprising given the political game of chickenthat has been played for the last several weeks.The fact that gold cannot default or gobankrupt unlike every single corporation, bank and government in the world ismaking it the safe haven of choice again. There is also the important fact thatunlike currencies and bonds, gold cannot be debased by bankers and centralbankers.Gold hasmarked a key Fibonaccipivot point and may now begin a new wave higher, potentially reaching $1900before year-end while on track to surpass the $2000 level in 2012.It's been several weeks since I've written about gold andwe have had a wild ride since the $1910-$1920 highs in August. At thetime, I wrote a major correction was imminent and we witnessed a $208 drop thattook place over just a few days. We covered our short at $1725 and thengold immediately rallied back to a double top at $1920. It then corrected backas scripted to 1531. Thatpullback to $1531 qualifies as a Fibonacci retracement of the 34-month rallyfrom $681 to $1920 and would also qualify for a price low for a fourth majorwave correction.Myinitial targets for the gold pullback were $1480-$1520 if the $1650 area wasviolated. Most recently, we have seen gold run up to $1681 (anotherFibonacci resistance zone) a few times and then back off to the low $1600's.Withthe recent push over $1681, we can now confirm the fourth wave is over at the$1531 lows and the fifth wave is likely in the very early stages, but beginningto build steam.Iwill say that we want to make sure the $1650-$1680 areas are defended by goldon any pullbacks in order for this forecast to remain valid. During thisfifth wave up, eventually we should see the $2380 range in gold, but it willnot take place overnight. Inthe next few months, I am looking for gold to attack the $1900 range, possiblyeven by year end, and then attack the $2000-plus range in 2012.Aswritten above, with all of the macro events in Europe changing on an almostdaily basis, the whipsaws in both the precious metals and equities markets aredifficult to forecast and trade for most investors. However, gold has beenmoving in defined Fibonacci and wave patterns for ten years now and if I'mright, has about three years left in a 13-year bull cycle.Belowis the updated weekly chart for gold. You can see prior lows as theyrelated to oversold indicators, and where we just came off the $1531 lows andits Fibonacci pivot along with the oversold indicators below. Lookfor gold to attack $1775 first, then $1800, $1840, and $1900 in the coming sixto ten weeks or so.The sharp recent correction in gold does not erase the long-termfundamental drivers that are still in place and likely to push the metal higher.So that begs thequestion how does the retail investor get into the gold trade now?Well a lot of this comes at a time frame when many people and muchthe public was underexposed to the gold move, from the move up from $1200,$1300, all the way to $1925. The sense is that gold will move too far too fast, and as aresult, people didn't want to chase the move. Well, the issues that helped goldrise are still very much in play.There is still a lot of question and concern about debasement ofcurrencies around the world. Overall, in terms of what various central banksare doing, that's still very much in play, and overall, peripheral andsovereign debt concerns have not been solved either.So we look at a way to have a real currency, a solid currency,gold still meets all those needs despite a short-term technical correction.In conclusion, I think that every retail investor needs to have20% of his portfolio in gold and silver. What they need is exposure to preciousmetals. The biggest threat to anyone in retirement is inflation. Especiallywith the debasement of the US dollar, this is still very big story. I suggestthat every retail investor buy something like the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), buy the iShares Gold Trust ETF(IAU), buy the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), Buy Newmont Mining (NEM), Goldcorp (GG) because besidesowning the underlying commodity, you want to own the companies that mine andproduce that commodity as well.That gives you somewhat of a diversified exposure,but buy owning the Market Vectors GoldMiners Trust (GDX), which is the gold miners ETF that consists of the top 30gold-mining stocks out there, you get all of the diversification you will needowning the mining stocks in one simple ETF. One thing is for sure, is the time to atleast put your toe in the water."

2011-11-08,David Einhorn's Letter Perfumed With Success,"I have never been a hedge fund manager, but I would imagine that those end-of-quarter letters can be a genuine joy to write, or an absolute chore, depending on how said quarter went. One has to imagine that, when David Einhorn sat down to rattle through his latest letter, he did so with a smile on his face. In the third quarter, Greenlight initiated new positions in CBS (NYSE: CBS), General Motors (NYSE: GM), and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ: MRVL). Not one but three major players. Let's not forget that Greenlight already has Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Gold, Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Vodafone (NYSE: VOD) on its portfolio. According to Market Folly, “Greenlight likes CBS due to its growing retransmission fees, monetization of their content library, as well as the potential for increased advertising spending by clients. The hedge fund bought CBS at $20.79 per share (less than 10x their estimate of 2012 earnings) and it now trades just north of $25.” As for GM, Greenlight's letter states that “GM is being priced by the market as a cyclical company trading at less than 6x this year's earnings. While some may see it as normal to value cyclicals at low multiples of peak earnings, we believe that 2011 is not a peak and, in fact, is below mid-cycle.” Finally, regarding MRVL, Einhorn and Greenlight are of the opinion that hard disc drives will remain relevant for some time yet. The cherry on the letter-cake is where Einhorn says that Greenlight has sold out of their long potitions in Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and BP (NYSE: BP) and covered the short of Amedisys (NASDAQ: AMED) during the quarter. Einhorn will be hoping that he is still smiling when it is time to put the Q4 letter together."
2011-11-08,Bigger Isn't Always Better With ETFs: Part II,"Continuing with our series that we started on Monday, Benzinga continues to sift through the vast landscape known as the world of ETFs looking for funds that are large by assets under management, but that give up performance to comparable ETFs with smaller asset bases. On Monday, our search turned up a mix of sector funds, emerging markets ETFs and one developed markets play. Let's see what today's edition of “Bigger Isn't Always Better With ETFs” turns up. A Classic Rivalry: The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) was the first ETF backed by physical gold to come to market and remains the largest in that niche. It's also the second-largest ETF in the world with almost $72 billion in AUM. On the other hand, the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) has “just” $9.6 billion in AUM. The reality is GLD and IAU move in lockstep with each other and basically do the same thing, so this isn't about performance. It's about fees. IAU has an expense ratio of 0.25%. GLD's 0.4%. The choice appears clear. An Oily Proposition: For all the controversy surrounding the U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) and how vulnerable this ETF is to contango, it remains popular for one reason or another and has over $1 billion in AUM. If you must dance with an ETF like USO, don't make it USO. Make it the U.S. Brent Oil Fund (NYSE: BNO), which is USO's equivalent for Brent Crude. A lot of governments and oil producers are going to Brent as their benchmark because of the wide spread between Brent and West Texas Intermediate. That's a boon for BNO, which is up more than 24% year-to-date compared to a negative run for USO. Another Golden Play: The conversation about gold mining ETFs usually goes in this order. 1) The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). 2) The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF. 3) Dead air. Well, we're willing to bet a lot of investors didn't know the Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG) has performed in line with GDX year-to-date and clobbered GDXJ. Now you know. Chinese Technology: We previously mentioned the Guggenheim China Technology ETF (NYSE: CQQQ) as an ideal way of playing high-flying Chinese tech stocks, if you dared. CQQQ has almost $28 million in AUM. Not bad for a niche fund like this, but that's dwarfed by the $177.1 million in AUM held by the Guggenheim China Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: HAO). Yet, CQQQ has trounced HAO in terms of performance this year. BRIC Battle: Let's make this simple. The iShares MSCI BRIC Index Fund (NYSE: BKF) has almost $800 million in AUM. That's nearly 60% better than what the Guggenheim BRIC ETF (NYSE: EEB). Similar funds to be sure, but not similar performance. EEB has easily outpaced BKF year-to-date AND it has the lower expense ratio at 0.6% compared to 0.69% for the iShares offering. Bull case: It's easy to be bullish on gold right now. In the case of the other funds, it will take non-gold commodities and emerging markets coming back into style to juice returns. QE3 anyone? Bear case: No QE3. Oil falls. Emerging markets get smashed and gold loses its safe haven status."

2011-11-14,Gold Producers Lead while Developers and Explorers Lag,"Back in August we wrote a piece titled: The Catalyst for Consolidation in the Gold Sector. We noticed that the large cap producers had begun to outperform the rest of the sector which consists of small producers, developers and explorers. Risk aversion, the Euro debt crisis and a struggling stock market has contributed to the continued underperformance of the riskier plays in a risky sector. The chart below shows GDX (large producers), GDXJ (developers, explorers) and the ratio between the two. As you can see, GDX was able to maintain its support while GDXJ broke support and made a new 52-week low. As a result, the ratio surged in favor of GDX. Traders and investors need to remember that gold stocks are a risky bunch and that the non-producers are extremely risky. Yes, the sector is in a bull market but that by itself is not enough to drive the speculative plays higher. Until we reach the bubble phase, the non producers will rise on their own merits and not because “it's a bull market.” Though we are likely at least two to three years from the birth of a bubble, does it mean the non-producers will continue to underperform in the meantime? Hardly. Remember, the large caps (GDX) have been in a consolidation for a year and that has a negative effect on the speculative plays. The longer a consolidation lasts, the more weak hands jump ship. At the start of the consolidation, the non-producers held up better. Ultimately they are going to underperform in a weak market and outperform in a strong market. The good news is the large caps are close to a major breakout which is not only a catalyst for the large stocks but a catalyst for everything else in the sector. A breakout in GDX, as we presume in the above chart, would certainly have a positive impact on junior developers and junior exploration plays which have underperformed badly in the last few months. After all, this is happened before. GDXJ performed better in Q3 and Q4 of 2010 when GDX broke out of an eight month consolidation. GDX also made a huge breakout in the second half of 2005 and junior stocks surged over the next 18 months. This time, GDX is close to a very significant breakout as it could pull away from a one-year base as well as the 2008 highs and on some charts, the 1980 highs. Although the non-producers have lagged, they would ultimately find a huge bid in the immediate aftermath of a breakout in GDX. Traders and investors need to know when to play it safe and when to take risks. Heading into this potential breakout, it is wise to stick with producers who are finding a bid. However, when the breakout appears imminent, it would be wise to set your sights a bit lower on the food chain and find the developers and explorers ready for a major rise.

2011-11-14,What Is Gold Telling Us Today?,"There is a very simply rule that traders should follow, when gold is trading higher it is signaling an inflating stock market. The opposite is true when gold is trading lower, it is signaling a deflating stock market. Gold and the major stock indexes are synonymous at this time and will trade in the same direction. Traders and investors should know that gold often leads the stock markets and will usually signal the direction for the major stock indexes. This morning, the popular SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) is declining by 0.85 cents to $173.11 a share. The GLD will have short term intra-day support around the $172.60 area. Should the GLD decline through that support area the next important support area will be around the $171.00 level. Many of the leading gold mining stocks are coming under some early selling pressure. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), Randgold Resources Limited (NASDAQ: GOLD), Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE: AUY), and Goldcorp Inc (NYSE: GG) are under some early selling pressure to start the day. Traders should watch the U.S. Dollar Index very closely, when the dollar declines intra-day these leading gold mining stocks are likely to catch a bid off of the morning lows.

2011-11-21,iShares Files for a Slew of New ETFs,"BlackRock's (NYSE: BLK) iShares unit, already the world's largest ETF sponsor, has filed plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to possibly introduce 12 new ETFs, several of which will compete directly with existing products. iShares will continue its almost unnoticed tradition of copycat funds that compete directly with Van Eck's Market Vectors business with iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund, which could be a direct rival to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). The Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) could see some competition in the form of the iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund. iShares has also filed plans for the iShares MSCI Global Energy Producers Fund, which will track an index of about 314 companies. The ETF would exclude alternative energy firms and focus on coal, natural gas and oil exploration and production firms. The Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO), far and away the largest equity-based agribusiness ETF on the market, might see a challenge by way of the iShares MSCI Global Agriculture Producers Fund.

2011-11-23,Five ETF Rivalries to Watch in 2012,"Avid fans and observers of the exchange-traded products industry know that there are plenty of ETFs from issuer A that do the same thing as a fund from issuer B. The proliferation of so many “me too” ETFs means there are some neat ETF rivalries to watch. And when it comes to those rivalries, some are known while others fly under the radar. The competition between the Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: VWO) and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM is obvious as is the tussle between the SPDR Gold Shares and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Those examples aside, let's look at five ETF rivalries that will be of interest to investors in 2012. Oil Rivalry The iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment Index Fund (NYSE: IEZ) and the Oil Services HOLDRs (AMEX: OIH) represent one of the more compelling ETF rivalries at the sector level and this rivalry should be all the more interesting next year as OIH becomes a Market Vectors ETF. Given the sector these ETFs track, we'll call this Texas vs. Texas A&M. Who Will Shine With Silver? Silver miners that is. Since its debut in April 2010, the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) has had the market on silver miners ETFs cornered because it has been the only ETF tracking some of these stocks. SIL won't be lonely much longer as iShares has filed plans for its own silver miners ETF. Of course, there's no guarantee the iShares fund will ever come to market, and even it does, SIL's first-to-market advantage cannot be underestimated. Beep Beep. The First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index (Nasdaq: CARZ) and the Global X Auto ETF (NYSE: VROM) both came to market this year with CARZ beating VROM out of the gate by about a week. However, VROM has $4.5 million in assets under management compared to $3.3 million for CARZ. Assuming the economy, namely the jobs picture, improves, this could turn out to be a nifty ETF battle. Given the sector, we'll call this Michigan vs. Michigan State. Going With Gold Next year, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) will celebrate its sixth birthday. It should also celebrate the fact that its dominance among ETFs tracking large-cap gold miners has led to AUM haul over $9.2 billion. Like SIL, GDX might be getting a rival in the form of an iShares gold miners ETF that the firm has filed plans for. GDX has a first-to-market advantage that has endured a couple of challengers to date. Will that trend continue against iShares? We'll call this the Gold Cup. Battle For Nigeria While there isn't a Nigeria-specific ETF on the market today, both Van Eck, parent company of Market Vectors, and Global X have filed plans to bring Nigeria ETFs to market. We're working on the premise that neither will come to market this and both will debut next year. To be clear, we do not know when either will debut. Given that both funds are likely to be heavy on energy names, this battle could come down to which ETF has the lower expense ratio, particularly if both ETFs come to market in a condensed period of time as CARZ and VROM did."
2011-11-30,Twelve For '12: Commodities ETFs to Watch In The New Year,"On the heels of our popular “Eleven For '11” series that we ran late last year, we're upping the ante by one this time around. No, it's not the 12 days of Christmas, though some might say it is a 12-round title fight. We're talking about looking at 12 ETFs across various sectors that merit consideration for 2012 and we're getting the ball rolling with some beta by looking at commodities funds. Always volatile, sometimes controversial, commodities have taken on a new role in the lexicon of ordinary investors thanks in large part to the evolution of the ETF industry. But those that end the discussion with gold and oil funds are missing out because there are many more potentially profitable opportunities for the taking in the commodities world. So let's get on with looking at 12 commodities ETFs (and ETNs) that are worth looking at in 2012. iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU): We didn't say ignore gold altogether, did we? After breaking through the $1,900 area in September, gold now resides well below $1,800. Concerned? Don't be. All of the issues that have fueled gold's run – Europe's debt woes, Uncle Sam's debt problem, a weak dollar – remain. Morgan Stanley said in a note today gold could average $2,200 an ounce next year. That makes IAU a steal at current levels. ETFS Physical Silver Shares (NYSE: SIVR): Maybe more volatile and easily more controversial than gold, silver will be in the spotlight again next year. Whether or not that's a good thing remains to be seen. As we noted earlier, considering that SIVR does the same thing as the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), SIVR is the better bet due to its lower expense ratio. Most 2012 price forecasts imply significant upside from current levels. United States Copper Fund (NYSE: CPER): Until we get an ETF backed by physical copper, the new United States Copper Fund will have to do. Dr. Copper is always a useful tell on the strength of major global economies. Of course, that has meant some tough times for the red metal as of late, but assuming we see more quantitative easing from global central banks, copper will rise. iPath DJ-UBS Livestock TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: COW): We haven't been shy about calling COW a dud this year. After all, cattle and hog prices were soaring this year and the experts were talking about how the newly affluent in emerging markets were eating more high-quality meat. All the while COW was struggling. We'll give credit where it's due and acknowledge COW is up 2.6% year-to-date. Perhaps bigger things await in 2012 if emerging markets return to glory. ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL): The only ETF devoted exclusively to physical palladium holdings is PALL. When things are good, they're very good for this ETF. And when they're bad, they're very bad, a fact highlighted by PALL's fall to around $55 in October from $85 in August. The big catalysts with palladium are auto sales in the U.S. and China and Russian production, or lack thereof. Get both of those things going in the metal's favor, and PALL could easily see the $80 area again. United States Brent Oil Fund (NYSE: BNO): If you're going to dabble in futures-backed exchange-traded products that track oil, do it with one that offers a play on Brent, not West Texas Intermediate. Yes, BNO should be on your radar for 2012, but if the ETF breaks $79, it could run back to its 52-week high of $84.19 this year. PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund (NYSE: DBA): Agricultural commodities have seen their share of drama this year, most of it bad. That is true, but two things should be remembered. First, corn, soybeans, etc. will not be left behind in a QE-induced commodities rally. Second, the long-term global food consumption and production trends are scary and that's very good for DBA. PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund (NYSE: DBB): All of a sudden the PowerShares DB Base Metals Fund's chart looks pretty good as the ETF now has room to tack on 10% or more in effort to get back to the 200-day line. What DBB really needs for a sustainable rally is good economic fundamentals from major global economies. That will prompt increased aluminum and copper demand as well as higher use of other industrial metals. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): An equity-based play or two belong on this list and why not start off with a gold miners ETF? Precious metals mining stocks and ETFs have been under fire this year for lagging the metals they extract from the earth, but that situation has been improving recently. Valuations on large-cap gold miners look compelling right now and if gold's bull run continues next year, and it should, GDX looks like a smart way to play that move. Global X Fertilizers/Potash ETF (NYSE: SOIL): Sure you can dance with other agribusiness ETFs, but one that is entirely devoted to fertilizer stocks actually makes a lot of sense. If the broader market improves next year, high-beta stocks like fertilizer and potash stocks will rally. And if you like an ETF like DBA, than the Global X Fertilizers/Potash ETF makes a lot sense as an equity-based alternative. Teucrium Corn ETV (NYSE: CORN): CORN has been a big a disappointment lately and the fund barely took place in Thursday's big rally. Relief may come in the form of election year politics that will likely see no smart candidate go to places like Iowa and Minnesota and say he or she wants to curb ethanol production. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP): XOP is a great tool for short-term traders with a volatile nature that is reminiscent of a leveraged ETF. The ETF's low expense ratio and exposure to integrated oil stocks is a plus for conservative investors. Not to mention, XOP is a play on just about every U.S. shale formation, rising oil prices and the fund is full of potential buyers and sellers in the energy M&A game."
2011-12-05,"ETFs to Watch December 5, 2011","Here is the ETF Professor's ETF Watch List for Monday December 5, 2011. The market could be due for a breather, so keep an eye on the ProShares UltraShort S&P500 (NYSE: SDS). The Market Vectors Gold ETF (NYSE: GDX) was punished on Friday. The Guggenheim Shipping ETF (NYSE: SEA) might be due for a pullback. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) is nearing some key technical levels. Emerging markets plays of the day: ProShares UltraShort Emerging Markets (NYSE: EEV), iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund (NYSE: EWY) and the Market Vectors Indonesia ETF (NYSE: IDX).

2011-12-06,Why Gold Stocks Have Underperformed and What Lies Ahead,"Gold is higher by 20% this year but the large cap gold stocks (GDX) are down 6% while the junior gold stocks (ETF) are down 25%. With Gold higher by 20%, we'd normally expect the gold stocks to be up 50% and more. Needless to say 2011 has been a difficult year for gold bugs. Its been a near disaster for most junior gold stocks. That being said, there are important but often ignored reasons why the gold shares have underperformed this year and reasons to consider why a big move may be only months away. First, we have to understand that gold mining is a very difficult business. The law of numbers makes it even more difficult for the largest producers. They have to operate multiple mines and then continuously acquire or find new resources to maintain reserves and maintain production levels into the future. It's a difficult business regardless of where the Gold price is. Hence, mining stocks do not outperform Gold over time whether in a bull market or not. The following chart is from Steve Saville who is one of the first to understand this subject. The surge in the 1960s was due to the Gold price being fixed. Also we must understand that Gold and gold stocks are entirely different markets that share different performance in a panic or crisis. Gold can be a safety hedge but gold stocks most certainly are not. They are the worst performers in any type of crisis. During the 1987 stock market crash, the gold stocks performed far worse than the market. The same happened in 2008 as the gold miners led the market crash. During the present European sovereign debt crisis, the gold stocks have actually held up reasonably well relative to other stocks. From top to bottom, emerging markets and commodity shares have been hit the hardest while gold stocks declined in line with the S&P 500. Keep in mind we are referring to the gold stocks as in the large producers. The senior gold stocks are notoriously volatile but the hundreds of mid-tier and junior companies are far more volatile than the seniors. If the seniors fall 15-20% then others can fall 40% or more. Moving along, one has to consider which is the best market index for tracking the gold stocks. We posit this as there are several indices but all are composed differently and therefore their performance is not always in line with each other. In the chart below we plot GDX, XGD.to, XAU and SIL. Note that GDX mirrors the HUI which is about 10% comprised of silver stocks. The XAU is comprised of 20% silver stocks and base metal stocks (FCX) while SIL, the silver stock ETF is 100% silver stocks. XGD is 100% in gold stocks and is priced in Canadian Dollars. Judging from this we see that the weakness is almost entirely in silver stocks and not in gold stocks. XGD is holding up the best and is little threat to break its summer lows while XAU and SIL are in downtrends that began in April and printed new lows in October. Though the gold stocks have underperformed Gold, note that XGD and GDX did make new, albeit marginal highs in September. The reality is during a tough year gold stocks have held up relatively well while silver stocks and smaller mining stocks have trended down. The gold stocks (GDX & XGD) have actually been in a consolidation that shares similarities to the consolidation from 2004-2005. See the chart below. The consolidation in 2004-2005 lasted 18 months and broke to a new high 23 months after the peak at the end of 2003. The 2001-2003 advance lasted 36 months and gained nearly 350%. The 2009-2010 advance gained 313% in 25 months. Based on time, the current consolidation would bottom this month and then break to a new high in March 2012. We should also note that the first consolidation bottomed at the 38% retracement and the lower 400-day band. The lower 400-day band is currently at $48 and should touch $51 by the end of January while the 38% retracement is at $47. The similarities between this consolidation and the 2004-2005 consolidation indicate that the gold stocks are in a consolidation and digesting the rapid rebound gains from 2009-2010. This along with the aforementioned reasons explains why the gold stocks have not broken out to new highs. Moreover, while not as strong as it was this year, Gold did make a new high in 2004 while the gold stocks lagged as they were stuck in a consolidation having to digest the massive gains from 2001-2003. That is another key similarity between the two periods. There is plenty of evidence that confirms we are likely in the latter stages of this consolidation. Here is a chart posted by my friend Sean Brodrick. It shows the HUI index along with the price earnings ratio of the index. The PE ratio is currently at its lowest point in nearly nine years. The next chart is from sentimentrader.com. It plots the Rydex Precious Metals Fund in line with the assets in the fund and the assets as a percentage relative to other sectors. As we can see, the assets in the fund are near an absolute low while relative to other sectors the assets are much closer to a low than a high. To conclude, the gold stocks have underperformed for a variety of reasons. Historically, it is what they tend to do- underperform. Secondly, the gold stocks have been stuck in a consolidation, digesting the rapid gains the post 2008 recovery. Third, the consolidation came about at a time when the first major aftershock from 2008 came to the forefront. The European sovereign debt crisis took equities and commodities lower and historically, the gold stocks are never spared from a panic or crisis. The good news is the gold equities are coming to the end of the consolidation and a resolution within months is likely. Sentiment is bullish from a contrary perspective. The consolidation has weeded out the week and impatient as earnings and cash flows for gold companies have improved and stock valuations have moved to multi-year lows. Even in Gold and Silver we see that speculative long positions are near multi-year lows. This setup combined with the forthcoming monetization in Europe, stimulus in China and more monetization from Bernanke could produce quite the launch pad for the gold shares in early 2012.

2011-12-07,Twelve For '12: Sector ETFs to Watch In The New Year ,"It has been a wild ride for investors in 2011, but when all is said and done, the top performers in terms of sector ETFs this year aren't likely to surprise anyone. Well, one might be a surprise, but the others not so much. Using SPDRs as our reference point, we find the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU) is up about 12% year-to-date. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) is up nearly 9%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV) is up about 7% while the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY), the sort of surprise, is up about 5%. All this while the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) is flat year-to-date. With 2012 being an election year, it's possible investors will remain pensive, further boosting the returns of funds like XLP and XLU. Or maybe Europe will get its act together and the U.S. economy will improve to the point where risk on really comes back on. Either way, there are scores of sector funds that will be in the spotlight next year. Here are 12 that could have big things ahead of them in 2012. In no particular order. iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment Index Fund (NYSE: IEZ): The iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment Index Fund's 2011 performance thus far can be viewed in two lights. Impressive that the ETF is only down 1% or depressing that it's down at all considering oil prices remain high by historical standards. The impact of the North American shale boom is arguably priced into many oil services stocks, so IEZ's 2012 fortunes may be more levered to increased demand in international such as Latin America and Russia. One thing to consider: IEZ will not be left behind if oil prices keep climbing. At less than $56 with the potential to see $75 or higher, IEZ looks good here. Global X Uranium ETF (NYSE: URA): We recently argued that things probably can't get any worse for URA. Really, it's hard to imagine that happening. The fundamental out look for the nuclear energy space is strong enough that at less than $9, URA could have savvy investors laughing all the way to the bank next year. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ): There has been a lot of talk of gold miners not performing as well as the yellow metal itself this year. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF is certainly guilty of that. However, what makes GDXJ all the more vexing is that miners have started to get their act together, but in the past three months the ETF is down over 21% while the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is only down 10%. Simply stated, risk on needs to come back on in 2012 to lift GDXJ. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR We just mentioned XLP as one of the top performers among sector ETFs in 2011, but this run might not be in the late innings. Not if 2012 mirrors 2011 even slightly. XLP might be a good play for the first half of 2012 as that's when most of the ETF's large holdings that pay dividends raise those payouts. iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average (NYSE: IYT): With all the economic bellwethers found in this ETF, IYT's fortunes are arguably the market's fortunes. Plus, it's THE ETF for all the Dow theorists out there. Should IYT break support in the $82 area, it could be a bumpy ride for this fund to start 2012. iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (Nasdaq: IBB): We can say one thing for the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF: It has performed quite well this year, up over 9%. And we can say one thing for the biotech sector: There are always trades to be had. Home to 122 stocks, IBB has plenty of buyers and sellers for biotech consolidation, of which there should be some next year. The ETF is a buy if you can get it on a pullback to $95. iShares S&P Global Financials ETF (NYSE: IXG): We could have gone with an ETF that only tracks U.S. banks or one that only tracks non-U.S. banks, but since almost ALL large banks have been stinking up the joint for over a couple of years now, IXG and its 220 stocks make life easy for those that like to be involved with financials. Germany, France and Spain account for 9% of IXG's country weight and unless things change quickly, that will be a problem next year. First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index Fund (Nasdaq: SKYY): Much has been made of niche sector ETFs like the First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index Fund. Critics love to assail these ETFs, saying they're not necessary. Well, someone likes SKYY because it has accumulated over $65 million in assets under management since its July debut. The growth of cloud-computing and the potential for industry consolidation make SKYY an interesting sub-sector play in 2012. Global X Social Media ETF (Nasdaq: SOCL): Talk about a tech ETF that has been under fire, hating on the Global X Social Media ETF is like a sport for some pundits. We beg to differ. With the looming Facebook IPO, SOCL could be legitimized sooner than later. Frankly, this is a sound concept and there's no legitimate reason to bash this fund. If the alpha is there, investors will come. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP): There are lots of energy ETFs. Roughly 80 if we're trying to be somewhat precise. Few offer the combination of exposure to integrated oil stocks, independent producers and mid-cap M&A targets as XOP does. Plus, XOP is valid way of getting exposure to just about every shale play in the U.S. and the ETF's volatility is great for short-term traders. For those that handle the volatility, XOP could see the $70 area in a favorable market next year. First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank ETF (Nasdaq: QABA): QABA isn't the newest ETF on our list, but it might be the most obscure. It only has $12.6 million in AUM and average daily trade of less than 2,600 shares. On the bright side, QABA has outperformed the ETFs tracking major bank stocks this year and most of its holdings have not been dividend offenders. If you're going to dance with devil, er financial sector ETFs, QABA merits consideration. Guggenheim Solar ETF (NYSE: TAN): We debated including an ETF that trades for less than $5 on this list, but after being one of the worst-performing ETFs in 2011, things have to get better for TAN next year, right? Not necessarily. If the things don't get sunny fast for solar stocks, TAN's race to $0 will only be prevented by a reverse split, an event that probably should have happened already."
2011-12-13,How to Profit from ManpowerGroup's Positive Jobs Report,"The job outlook at American employers is the most promising that it has been since 2008 but uncertainty is also on the rise, according to the Manpower Employment Outlook survey for the the 1st quarter of 2012. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin based temporary staffing firm released its quarterly employment outlook report on Tuesday and said that when seasonal adjustments were factored into its survey results that the net employment outlook for the first quarter of 2012 climbed to +9%, up from the previous quarter's employment outlook of +7%. ManpowerGroup (NYSE: MAN) surveyed 18,000 employers to find out about their plans for hiring in the upcoming quarter. The survey found that 70% of employers expected employee numbers to remain the same during the next quarter, 14% of employers plan to increase staff levels and only 9% of those surveyed planned staffing reductions. ManpowerGroup's net employment outlook improved from +5% to +9% when seasonal adjustments were taken into account. Another bright spot in the report from ManpowerGroup is that the company has now seen nine consecutive quarters of positive hiring outlook, after it reported three negative quarters during 2009. The report also marked the first time since the first quarter of 2011 that ManpowerGroup observed a quarter-over-quarter rise in employers' hiring plans. ManpowerGroup also said that uncertainty was on the rise because the amount of employers who were unsure of their hiring plans for the next quarter surged to 7%, up from the previous quarter's 3%. The dramatic rise was the biggest quarterly jump that ManpowerGroup has reported since 1977. It also represented the biggest percentage of uncertain employers that ManpowerGroup has reported since 2005. ManpowerGroup's President of the Americas Jonas Prising said that slow, but steady momentum has improved employer confidence, which is likely why more employers are planning to hire in the first quarter. Mr. Prising went on to caution that “this uptick is encouraging, but the historically high proportion of employers that are unsure of their hiring plans indicates continued uncertainty about the future and ongoing caution when it comes to staffing plans.” The takeaway from the Manpower Employment Outlook survey is generally positive because if employers overall plans to increase hiring reduces unemployment, consumers should start spending more, which could lead to more job growth as companies increase hiring further to meet increased demand. However, it should be noted that while overall employment should move higher, the overwhelming majority of employers have no plans to increase their staff levels. What might be more interesting to investors is that the planned hiring increases are much higher in some industries than in others. The two sectors with the most optimistic hiring plans were Mining, which had an employment outlook of +16%, and Leisure & Hospitality, which had an employment outlook of +14%. On the other hand, Construction was the only sector whose employers reported plans to reduce staffing levels, with an employment outlook of -7%. There are a number of ways for investors to trade on the information contained in the Manpower Employment Outlook survey for the the 1st quarter of 2012. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that the optimistic outlook for the Mining and the Leisure & Hospitality sectors is a positive sign for those industries might want to consider the following trades: The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Powershares Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment Portfolio Fund (NYSE: PEJ) are three ETFs that could climb higher if the expected staffing increases lead to sales growth in either of these two sectors.Bearish:Traders who believe that the Construction sector's plan to cut jobs in the next quarter is a bad sign may consider some alternate positions:You might want to stay away from ETFs like the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE: XHB) and the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index Fund (NYSE: ITB) and instead short stocks like D.R. Horton (NYSE: DHI), Shaw Group (NYSE: SHAW) and Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR). If ManpowerGroup's report that the hiring outlook for the Construction sector is looking grim is a sign that construction stock prices could move lower in the next quarter, shorting these stocks could prove to be profitable.Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is another commodities M&A play. The iShares Silver Trust (NSYE: SLV) is starting to look cheap. Developed market play: iShares MSCI Sweden Index Fund (NYSE: EWD).

2011-12-29,Banished: 2011's Biggest ETF Disappointments,"With just one full trading day left in 2011, everyone is making a list of about what worked and what did not in 2011 and what investment themes may or may not prove profitable in the year ahead. Hey, we've even done a few of our own lists. And with just one trading day left in the year, it's fair to say 2011 has been another good year for the exchange-trade products business. Even in a tough market environment, assets under management have grown and the number of new funds that have come to market in 2011 has been robust to say the least. Still, there have been small signs that everything isn't perfect when it comes to ETFs. In an industry that is growing this much this fast, there are bound to be disappointments and 2011 brought a few. For our list of this year's biggest ETF washouts, performance was not the sole determining factor of whether or not an ETF made the list. In fact, we're leaving some predictable suspects like the uranium ETFs off the list. Asset growth, volume and other factors were considered as we populated the list of 2011's Biggest ETF Disappointments. In no particular order... Market Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF (NYSE: REMX) REMX came to market late last year and today, the ETF has over $200 million in AUM and it's safe to say most investors know about this ETF. However, what they may know is that REMX has been an epic disappointment this year. The fundamental catalysts of restricted Chinese exports of rare earths and demand for rare earths in smartphones, tablets, cars, etc. was there for the most part, but REMX has tumbled 35% and things have gotten worse recently, not better. If this ETF falls below $14, watch out. WisdomTree India Earnings ETF (NYSE: EPI) My how the mighty have fallen. The WisdomTree India Earnings ETF was a 2011 angel that fell back to earth hard in 2011. With one trading day left in the year, EPI is down 40% year-to-date and like almost every other ETF, EPI's chart is market by lows highs and lower lows. Today the ETF is in major technical danger. No one could have forecast 2011 would be this bad for this fund. Direxion Daily Financial Bear Shares (NYSE: FAZ) Since we've already been critical of FAZ, we'll take it easy on the controversial ETF today. However, it should be noted that in a terrible year for bank stocks, FAZ is off almost 19%. iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) OK, so it probably wasn't reasonable to expect SLV to replicate 2010's stellar run, but 2011 has been a disaster. It's even worse when considering ETFs backed by physical gold are up about 10% on the year. And worse than all that is SLV has shown no signs of improvement in recent weeks. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) Really, any gold miners ETF would be fine to put in this spot, but will go with the biggest. GDX is down more than 15% year-to-date while the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) is up 10%. Enough said. Oh yeah, GDX recently violated critical support at $52 and unless the risk on trade comes back with a vengeance, this ETF and related fare could be in for more downside. IndexIQ Hong Kong Small Cap ETF (NYSE: HKK) We figured this ETF would struggle because 2011 has been unkind to emerging markets, but we also thought it would survive and eventually thrive. That is not the case as HKK was recently shuttered. ProShares UltraShort MSCI Europe (NYSE: EPV) Yes, we've picked on this one, too. However, this should have been the easiest trade of 2011: Short Europe. There's no such thing as a free lunch in the financial markets and leveraged ETFs such as EPV underscore that fact. iShares MSCI Sweden Index Fund (NYSE: EWD) Maybe we're being a bit harsh by including the iShares MSCI Sweden Index Fund on this list and we that because there's still good reason to believe in the Swedish economy, its AAA credit and low debt. However, Sweden as represented by EWD should have been a safe haven for investors in 2011. Quite the contrary. The ETF has slid more than 17%. On the bright side, EWD has started to perk up lately and the yield of over 4% is enticing here. PowerShares Financial Preferred ETF (NYSE: PGF) Maybe we're being a tad harsh again, but in a yield-starved environment, 2011 should have been a great year to be involved with preferred ETFs. PGF's biggest problem isn't that it tracks preferred stocks. It's the sector where all those preferred issues come from. The yield is almost 7.7%. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Financials Index Fund (Nasdaq: EMFN) Emerging markets. Bank stocks. Over 47% of an ETF's weight allocated to China, Brazil and India. It's easy to explain why EMFN has languished this year. For an iShares ETF, EMFN is small with just $3.1 million in AUM. The 7% yield is big and destined to get bigger.

2012-01-03,Powerful rebound in gold and silver prices about to begin? ,"Originally posted on Stockhouse.com Silver charts reveal technical damage not seen since the destruction of 1984 Rarely has such technical destruction been visited on stalwart sectors such as gold, silver and the mining stocks (GDX). The silver charts reveal technical damage not seen since the destruction of 1984. It can only be conjecture that can account for a once in a generation obliteration of a once hallowed sector. It must be remembered that both gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) had major moves earlier this year to the $1900 and $50, surpassing overhead resistance and reaching overbought territory. This may be the reason why the decline in precious metal is overextended and extremely oversold. We urged caution back in April for silver and in September for gold. Silver has characteristically corrected close to 50% from its highs, while gold has fallen less than 20%. Pullbacks are normal and restorative in a secular bull market in precious metals especially after explosive moves. Unless such technical destruction is reflective of an upcoming geopolitical news development, we must look for more mundane causes. When the woods are ablaze, the fire obliterates the sequoias at the same time they incinerate the pines. The recent declines may be the result of a rush to the U.S. dollar (UUP) and treasuries (TLT).

2012-01-09,Gold Mining Stocks Must Be Traded,"There are so many traders and investors that believe that the gold mining stocks will automatically trade along with gold, the precious metal; this is not always the case. Every stock has its own set of issues that it will face. Very often the price of gold and the gold mining stocks will trade in tandem with each other, however, there will be times when the mining stocks will lag and other times when they will lead the price of gold. Each different gold mining stock must be followed and watched closely on an individual basis. These days the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is beginning to form a sideways bullish base on the daily chart. This type of pattern could setup for another leg higher. The problem with the GDX is that it is still trading below the daily chart 50, and 200 moving averages. These important moving averages will be the next important daily chart resistance levels for the GDX. Short term traders can watch for intra-day resistance around the $54.25, and $54.65 levels. Some leading gold mining stocks that are trading slightly higher this morning include Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE: AUY), Goldcorp Inc (NYSE: GG), and Royal Gold Inc (NASDAQ: RGLD). Traders must remember that these stocks will not always follow the price of gold and will trade according to their own cycle. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"

2012-02-01,Gold Miners Look Tired,"All of the leading gold mining stocks have surged higher over the past week. The popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has rallied higher by over $6.00 since January 25, 2012. This is a very fast move in such a small span of time. Whenever an equity rallies this quickly it will usually need to pullback or consolidate before moving higher. Traders can easily see that the GDX has been halted by the daily chart 200 moving average. Leading gold mining stocks such as Randgold Resources Ltd (NASDAQ: GOLD), Royal Gold Inc (NASDAQ: RGLD), and Gold Corp Inc (NYSE: GG) are looking very similar to the GDX. These leading gold mining stocks will most likely need to consolidate at this time. Once these stocks can base or consolidate for a while they could be possibly bought again.

2012-02-02,More Me Too ETFs From iShares Debut Today,"Keeping up a blistering pace of new product introductions in 2012 BlackRock's (NYSE: BLK) iShares, the world's largest ETF sponsor, will introduce five new ETFs today. All five are equities-based commodities funds and at least three of the five look to be direct rivals to currently existing ETFs from other issuers. The The iShares MSCI Global Agriculture Producers Fund (NYSE: VEGI) will have an expense ratio of 0.39% and track an index of nearly 170 companies. According to VEGI's fact sheet, Monsanto (NYSE: MON), Potash (NYSE: POT) and Deere (NYSE: DE) account for over 28% of the fund's weight. Other top-10 holdings include Agrium (NYSE: AGU) and Mosaic (NYSE: MOS). Translation: VEGI will butt heads with the Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO), which has been the dominant large-cap agribusiness ETF on the market since it debuted in 2007. Taking on MOO has proven to be no easy task for other ETF issuers. Next up is the iShares MSCI Global Energy Producers Fund (NYSE: FILL). FILL will also have an expense ratio of 0.39% and track an index of 313 stocks, according to the ETF's fact sheet. With a top-10 lineup that includes Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-A) and BP (NYSE: BP), among others, FILL looks a lot like the iShares S&P Global Energy Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IXC) and a bit like the SPDR S&P International Energy Sector ETF (NYSE: IPW). FILL does offer a combined allocation of over 7% to refiners and coal producers. The iShares MSCI Global Select Metals & Mining Producers (NYSE: PICK) is next up on the docket. That fund will also have fees of 0.39% and track an index of 363 holdings. Home to BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP), Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) and Vale (NYSE: VALE), among others, the ETF looks somewhat like the iShares S&P Global Materials ETF (NYSE: MXI). The iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund (NYSE: RING), which also has an expense ratio of 0.39% and tracks an index of 42 stocks, has a lineup that makes the fund look like a rival to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). With over $9.4 billion in assets, GDX is the dominant gold miners ETF, but with an expense ratio of 0.53%, GDX could be vulnerable to some competition from RING. Finally, the iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP) will also debut on Thursday. That ETF will also feature an expense ratio of 0.39% and track an index of 30 stocks. While the weightings are different, over half of SLVP's top-10 holdings are the same as what's found among the top-10 constituents of the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL). SIL has a much higher expense ratio of 0.65%, but with $361.3 million in assets under management, the Global X offering has a deep first-to-market advantage. Last week, iShares launched seven new ETFs including four that will be direct rivals to currently existing funds. Prior to that, the firm unveiled three new funds on January 12."
2012-02-07,Canada ETFs: Beyond EWC,"Did you know that ice hockey is not the only national sport of Canada? Hockey, the sport for which are our northern neighbors are most known, is the national winter sport of Canada while lacrosse is the country's national summer sport. Fun fact #2: The iShares MSCI Canada ETF (NYSE: EWC), the largest Canada-specific ETF by a wide margin, is not the best-performing ETF tracking this steady, materials-rich developed market. Similar to the situation we highlighted regarding Brazil, EWC's nearly $4.8 billion in AUM might lead some investors to believe size equals success. Yes and no. Yes, EWC is up year-to-date, but no, that doesn't mean its the best of Canada ETF lot. In fact, comparing EWC's returns to five other Canada ETFs lands the iShares offering right in fourth place. That's not even a bronze medal. Before rushing north of the border, consider the options beyond EWC. IndexIQ Canada Small Cap ETF (NYSE: CNDA) When an ETF is as heavily weighted to materials and energy stocks as CNDA is (those sectors represent 73% of the ETF's weight) it's going to endure some tough times in years like 2011. Translation: CNDA is a risk on ETF and that has helped the ETF jump almost 12% this year, which is far superior to what EWC has offered. Energy and materials are two of the most important sectors to Canada's economy, but they account for less than half of EWC's weight meaning CNDA might be the more accurate representation of the Canadian economy. Global X S&P/TSX Venture 30 Canada ETF (NYSE: TSXV) Talk about materials and energy, the unheralded Global X S&P/TSX Venture 30 Canada ETF allocates almost 80% of its weight to those sectors. Not even a year old, TSXV isn't winning any popularity contests among Canada ETFs, but the fund is up almost 27% year-to-date. That's way better than EWC and CNDA. Guggenheim Canadian Energy Income Fund (NYSE: ENY) The Guggenheim Canadian Energy Income Fund has slightly trailed EWC year-to-date, but ENY does feature a yield of 2.71% compared to 1.98% for its larger rival. If ENY can notch some closes above $18, which is in the area of its 200-day moving average, that might be the recipe to stoke some fresh buying. Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE: GLDX) Here's a tip: There's much more the world of gold mining ETFs than just the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). And here's a disclaimer: The Global X Gold Explorers ETF is not a Canada-specific ETF. With over 85% exposure to Canada, it might as well be though. A resurgence in gold mining shares has helped GLDX to a year-to-date gain of better than 14% and that has come without the help of standard gold mining fare such as Barrick (NYSE: ABX) and Goldcorp (NYSE: GG). GLDX's 27 holdings are far more obscure, but thus far in 2012 that hasn't mattered. Global X Canada Preferred ETF (NYSE: CNPF) The first ETF devoted to Canadian preferred issues has done alright for itself since its May 2011 debut. Yield-hungry investors have poured over $12.6 million in cash into the ETF and CNPF is up year-to-date though has lagged EWC. Looking at the chart, CNPF might be a buy above $15.25."
2012-02-10,"Benzinga Exclusive: David Einhorn Comments On Apple TV, Gold, and Japan","Top value-oriented hedge fund manager David Einhorn is speaking today at the Columbia business school. This afternoon, Einhorn, whose comments frequently move the markets, spoke about the prospects for Apple TV, gold and Japan in addition to commenting on a number of other stocks in which he holds positions. Einhorn remains positive on Apple and believes that the company can succeed even if its TV (about which rumors are swirling on the internet) does not. Einhorn said that it will be important for the TV to be revolutionary. He told the audience that he still likes Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) without taking the potential of Apple TV into consideration. As of the end of the third quarter of 2011, Einhorn's hedge fund Greenlight Capital had a roughly $600 million position in AAPL, making it the fund's single biggest holding. Einhorn also said that he is still long gold (his fund's second biggest position as of 9/30/2011 was the Market Vectors Gold Miner ETF (NYSE: GDX) and it has also been widely reported that Greenlight has a massive physical stash of the yellow metal stored in private vaults). Speaking about Japan, the hedge fund manager said that out-of-the-money options in Japan (presumably on JGB's and the Yen) are mispriced and will be very profitable if the European debt crisis makes its way to that country. A number of prominent hedge fund managers are shorting Japanese Government Bonds and the Yen on the expectation that Japan, which has the world's highest debt/GDP ratio, will be swept up in the sovereign debt crisis. Speaking about some specific stocks, Einhorn said that he looked at investing in Walgreens (NYSE: WAG), but does not currently have a position. He said that hobbling Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM) has critical mass problems, but that the company's balance sheet is not that bad. He said while the stock wasn't a great investment at current levels, it wasn't a short either. Speaking about Dell (NASDAQ: DELL), which he owns, Einhorn said that the company was smart to buy back its stock at $15.00, but has paid too much for some of its acquisitions. He added that DELL's business is trading at around 4x earnings when backing out the $7 per share in cash the company has on its balance sheet. The Greenlight manager said that he is still short Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (NASDAQ: GMCR), which has fallen from a high of $116 in September to $62.87 on Friday. Einhorn stated that there were 20-30 ways for his short thesis to play out. He also mentioned another one of his high profile short positions - St. Joe (NYSE: JOE) - arguing that the company's land holdings are worth around $7 per share and that efforts to develop some of its real estate in Florida have not been successful."
2012-02-21,Buffett Mischaracterizes Gold's Bull Market,"Once again, someone famous and once again Warren Buffett is dismissing Gold. In comparing it to the bubbles in housing and Internet stocks, he feels he'll ultimately be vindicated. In his annual letter to shareholders, Buffett trashed Gold as a bubble that is being driven by fear of other asset classes. He believes that those who buy today only do so because they believe the “ranks of the fearful will grow.” Fear is a word that is tossed around all too often when ignorant commentators and analysts have to justify a rise in Gold. They can't say its a bull market. They can't say its supply and demand. They can't explain the fundamentals. Fear is an incomplete explanation. Fear should refer to fear or concern about the value of reserve currencies, not other asset classes. This is not rocket science. The developing world understands the value of Gold as various currencies under the weight of financially weak governments lost significant value throughout the 20th Century. Do you think the Pound or the Dollar has a bad track record? Consider the history of currency destruction in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia. It is multiples worse. Generally speaking Buffett is right: stocks or businesses are a better investment than Gold. They make sense. They produce something, they earn profits. They grow. Even considering the survivorship bias, the trend for stocks historically is always higher. Gold is a speculation and always will be. However, Buffett fails to note the long-term cyclicality between stocks and Gold. The inverse relationship is clear and Gold's time is now. The current case for Gold is all to simple. The leading nations of the world must monetize current and future debts to prevent a potentially catastrophic deflationary depression. In a debt crisis, currencies lose substantial value. We are in a global debt crisis and ground zero is the developed world. But Gold is a bubble! It's gone up 10 years in a row and the public is in. Right? Did you know the Dow Jones Industrial Average from 1985-1999 only had one year in the red and it was only a decline of 4%? Did you know the global allocation to Gold and gold-related investments is barely more than 1%? Furthermore, if Gold were in a bubble, we wouldn't be seeing the large cap stocks trading at 12x trailing earnings (see (NYSE: GDX)) nor would we see junior exploration companies trading at multi-year lows relative to Gold. Clearly Buffett doesn't understand Gold. He doesn't mention its appeal as an inflation hedge or as a currency. He falsely assumes its rise is a result of only wild speculation and a disdain for everything else. He has no idea how under-owned Gold is nor is he aware of the valuations of the shares. However, you can't fault his reasoning for wanting to own stocks. He believes he can invest in companies that will benefit from inflation or continue to earn profits that will outpace inflation. He has investments in energy companies and agriculture companies. To some degree, those companies are affected by commodity prices. Why not consider an investment in Silver Wheaton or Franco Nevada? There has to be someone in Buffett's camp that is intrigued by the precious metals royalty companies. They don't have mining risk. They earn profits and pay a dividend. In the long run Buffett will be right. Gold and gold shares will probably flame out in spectacular fashion. The public will get killed. However, this is closer to ten years away than one or two years in the future. Many were calling stocks a bubble in 1995. Not 1999. 1995! That was when the bubble was just getting started. The next breakout in the gold equities and the metals themselves will serve as a recognition move to the masses. It will be a springboard to an eventual bubble. This is a very volatile, cyclical sector so one must do Buffett-like due diligence in picking stocks.

2012-02-24,Gold Stocks at the End of Wall of Worry Stage,"By Jordan Roy-Byrne, CMT Over the past few months we've analyzed gold stocks from a historical perspective. We've compared this bull market to the past bull market as well as historical bull markets in equities. We've found that nothing is out of the ordinary. Gold stocks are not being manipulated. In fact, this bull market is actually ahead of the bull market in the 1960s and 1970s. They are following a typical bull market which evolves in three stages: the stealth phase, the wall of worry phase then the bubble or public phase. The wall of worry stage entails many twists and turns and marginal new highs along the way. Profits continue to rise but valuations drop as investors remember the first major correction of the bull market. Gold Stocks have quietly rebuilt momentum. GDX (NYSE: GDX) reversed its breakdown in January and has steadily climbed back. One thing of note, the daily RSI has not pierced 70 since May 2010. Momentum has subdued for almost two years while the gold stocks have not had a rip roaring breakout to new highs since early 2006! Though GDX is trading above its 2008 levels, it has never pulled away from or sustained a breakout through that level of 55. We are essentially looking at a multi-month consolidation but a potential breakout from a multi-year base. Should GDX rally back to 66 it would setup a potential cup and handle pattern which would project to 82. By the time the market breaks 66 it should have some serious momentum behind it and of the character that we haven't seen since early 2006. We believe there are a variety of driving forces (aside from the obvious) for a continued advance and break to new highs. First, the stock market is nearing long term resistance. It could fail at resistance coinciding with precious metals challenging new highs. Second, the combination of low valuations and a move in Gold to new highs would be very explosive. The market would realize that earnings are growing rapidly yet valuations are near a floor. Third, the large gold producers are increasing their dividends. According to Bloomberg: Agnico and Kinross said Feb. 15 they will increase their payouts to investors. Barrick, Goldcorp and AngloGold have also announced dividend increases in the past year. Newmont Gold, the second-biggest gold miner by sales, said yesterday it's more than doubling its quarterly dividend, 10 months after announcing it would link payments to the gold price. Increased dividends will attract more mainstream investors who can achieve income, inflation protection and exposure to a bull market. However, the real gains will be in juniors who can grow their production or juniors which outline significant discoveries. That is what we cover in The Daily Gold Premium.

2012-02-27,Warren Buffett Warns Against Gold Bubble,"Famed billionaire investor Warren Buffett warned investors of the dangers associated with gold and bonds in his recent annual letter to shareholders. The Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) said that he considered gold to be a member of an asset class that never produced anything of value and that if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end. While critics of Warren Buffett's investment strategy like Jim Cramer have questioned Buffett's aversion to gold during a time that the commodity has seen its value climb ever higher, Buffett criticized them for investing in an asset that is neither of much use nor procreative. Buffett said that gold investors were mostly motivated by a fear of of almost all other assets and a belief that the number of investors who shared their fears would grow. He said that the rising price of gold attracted investors who saw the rising price as a validation of the gold enthusiasts' investment thesis. Buffett went on to warn that gold's “bandwagon” investors were in danger of creating another investment bubble, saying that over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the 'proof' delivered by the market, and the pool of buyers – for a time – expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop. Buffett also had nothing good to say about currency denominated investments such as bonds, cash, money market funds and mortgages. He noted that several times over the past century these investments had eroded the value of their owners' holdings, despite the fact that they received regular payments of interest and principal. Because governments ultimately determine the value of money, Buffett said that currency denominated were at great risk when governments turn to policies that create inflation. While Warren Buffett's timing hasn't always been perfect, he's more often right than wrong when it comes to long term investing. He's faced criticism during similar situations in the past, such as when he avoided internet stocks. If gold turns out to be the latest bubble investment, investors who heeded the advice of Warren Buffett will be thankful once again. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that Warren Buffett is overstating the risks associated with gold and bonds might want to consider the following trades: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) and the Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) ETFs could both increase in price if Buffett is proven wrong.The iShares Barclays Aggregate Bond Fund (NYSE: AGG) and the Vanguard Total Bond Market (NYSE: BND) ETFs could also climb higher if the Oracle of Omaha has lost his touch.Bearish:Traders who believe that considering his track record, it's worth listening to any investment advice given by Warren Buffett may consider alternative positions:The PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) and the ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NYSE: TBT) ETF could both offer significant upside if Buffett is proven right once again.Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2012-02-27,"Centerra Gold's CEO Talks Gold, Mining Outlook in 2012","After Friday's Centerra Gold (TSX: CG) Q4 2011 earnings release, President and CEO Stephen Lang spoke with Benzinga on forward outlook, the price of gold, and company guidance. Centerra Gold reported Q4 2011 earnings of $79.4 million or $0.34 per common share on revenues of $248 million, compared to earnings of $150.8 million or $0.64 per common share of revenues of $322.3 million in Q4 2010. Lower gold sales in the period were cited as a reason. Highlights of the release include a $1 billion revenue milestone achievement in 2011 and 8.1 million ounces of contained gold in proven and provable gold reserves for the company. Centerra Gold expects 2012 consolidated gold production in the range of 635,000 to 685,000 ounces, relatively flat to 2011 production numbers of 642,380 ounces in 2011 and 674,941 ounces in 2010. The company expects cash costs of $465-$500 per ounce in 2012, compared to 2011 cash costs of $502 per ounce and $440 per ounce in 2010. We tend to be fairly conservative in our own outlook, Lang said to Benzinga. One thing we've done [in the] last two years on guidance, we've moved any permitting risk from production estimation. We clearly have the opportunity in Mongolia if we can get the final permits, bringing the Gatsuurt project online. Centerra Gold has two operational mines, the Kumtor mine in Central Asia, and the Boroo mine in Mongolia. The company's Gatsuurt mine preparation is complete and as aforementioned once approval is received it will commence mining operations. Most of what is needed at Gatsuurt into production is already built and in place, Lang said. After about three years of operation it's another $80 million to handle different types of ore. The rising price of gold has been kind to Centerra Gold. I think on the short term, it is certainly the price of gold, Lang said. I think if we go a little further into next year first [with permits] in Mongolia, we have another project there that is looking to get into operation that should give us a very quick burst of growth with no real added capital. Where does Lang see the price of gold going, in terms of currencies and trading weakness in currency pairs? I don't know that I would call gold a 'safe haven,' Lang said, but the fact that you have so many currencies that look extremely weak and bounce against each other. . . The price of gold may in fact dip from that, but longer term [currencies look] weak compared to the hard commodities. In regards to current and future exploration opportunities for Centerra Gold, Lang said to Benzinga that the company may move its focus into Asia if opportunities are of value. Couple of different levels – [regarding] exploration opportunities with other companies as joint ventures, I think we entered four additional agreements last year including our first in China; one in Russia, one in Turkey, [and] one in the U.S., Lang said. I think we're moving more of our focus away from the U.S. and into Asia. We continue to look, Lang said, We wouldn't rule it out, [but] sometimes the opportunities don't look all that attractive compared to what we already have. The Oksut project in Turkey, Centerra Gold's joint venture with Stratex International, was cited by Lang as promise not highlighted heavily by media. The drill results are very interesting, Lang said, pointing to the project's pure grade gold findings. Just as a pure grade, two grams is a very attractive grade right now, Lang said. [You] see a lot of projects built at or below one. . . [We] have a number of holes, 200 meters, [with ~two gram gold] starting at the surface. This is a good run of highly oxidized material, very amenable. Recent analyst recommendations for Centerra Gold range, but both appear to have a positive spin on company outlook. In a research note from February 13, BMO Capital Markets states that, The company has consistently demonstrated successful containment of capital and operating cost pressures, leaving it poised to benefit from solid margins and free cash flow through 2012. Aggressive exploration programs target advancing organic growth prospects while a strengthening balance sheet may allow for consideration of other opportunities or increased dividends. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has an Underperform rating on Centerra Gold, but appears optimistic for 2012 stating in a research report published February 24 that, We consider 2012 to be a year of transition for Centerra as it ramps up capital spending at Kumtor to develop future sources of higher grade production both in the open pit and underground. Investors may also be wary of Centerra Gold's Kumtor mine strike, a ten-day ordeal stemming from the company's refusal to pay Turkey's social fund, similar to the U.S.' Social Security program. Workers also reportedly demanded compensation for the family of a miner who died in a workplace accident. The strike, called illegal by Centerra Gold, ended in the workers' favor with an approximate cost settlement of $4 million. Gold is definitely a point of contention in 2012's market, with famous faces on both sides of the spectrum. Warren Buffett, in his annual letter to shareholders, warned investors against investing in gold and bonds, stating that if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end. In the letter, Buffett also warned against investing with one's fear, and that the commodity's bandwagon investors may create a bubble with the metal. Regardless of a potential bubble, mining ETFs and collectively, the mining stocks, have underperformed the price of gold. A trader could look to the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) as an option. Centerra Gold was trading at $20.55 at the time of posting, down 4.11% from Friday's market close. Shares of Centerra Gold are up 14.39% year-to-date and up 11.66% in the past year. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish: Traders who believe that Warren Buffett may be overstating gold's risks might want to consider the following trades: Centerra's chart has experienced upward movement for over a decade and a position may prove profitable. Stateside, gold companies such as Aurizon Mines (NYSE: AZK), Richmont Mines (NYSE: RIC), and NovaGold Resources (NYSE: NG) may be worth a look. The Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) and the SPDR Gold Trust could both increase in price if Buffett is wrong. Bearish: Traders wishing to avoid this potential bubble may consider alternative positions: The PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) could offer significant upside. A potential hedge against weakness in gold could be the U.S. Dollar. A trader may look to the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP).

2012-02-28,Small Cap Gold Stocks Successfully Retest 2010 Breakout,"By Jordan Roy-Byrne, The Daily Gold When one speaks of gold stocks they should be more specific as the sector is diverse. The term Gold stocks usually refers to the large unhedged producers. Indices such as the HUI or GDX track these stocks and are a proxy for the gold stock universe. However, most companies in the sector are much smaller. We hear the term “juniors” so often and that is what makes it inconsistent. Juniors are typically micro-cap exploration companies. Yet, GDXJ the junior ETF is comprised of companies with market caps in the $500 Million to $1 Billion range. There is nothing junior about that. We notice there is a gap in terms of terminology. If Juniors are sub- $100 Million, and large caps are over $1 Billion, then what do you call those that fit the gap? We prefer to use the term “established juniors” or small cap. After all, small caps by definition are in market cap between $100 Million and $1 Billion. These terms are most appropriate for those in the middle of said range rather than the bottom or top. We prefer the established juniors as being established (which is open to interpretation) they have less risk than the true juniors and if successful can grow to $1 Billion or more in capitalization. In our opinion, small caps are the area to focus on as they have a much greater likelihood of growth and leverage to Gold than the large producers. Historically, the large producers do not outperform Gold on a consistent basis. The law of numbers combined with the difficulty of the mining business explains why. Our junior/small cap index consists of 20 stocks equally weighted with a median market cap of about 600 Million. In the second half of 2010 the market broke to new highs for the first time since 2007. With every breakout comes a retest. Heading into 2011 we predicted the retest would last into the summer. The retest lasted the entire year but appears to be successful. Our bet is that the small caps will work their way back to the high before the end of the summer. It will take the time to overcome resistance but the trend will remain higher. If and when the market makes a new all-time high it will be very bullish for several reasons. It would be the first sustained breakout to a new all-time high since 2005-2006. It would come at a time when the bull market is starting to transition out of the wall of worry phase. Finally, it would generate significant momentum when overhead resistance is basically nil. This is possible due to a combination of Gold rising and present low valuations improving. In the next chart we graph our index and the ratio of our index to Gold. Gold companies are generating record profits and the price of Gold is near its all-time high yet leveraged small caps are trading near a low relative to Gold. That, in our view is a function of market sentiment and evidence of the wall of worry stage. If the ratio would rise back to its 2007 and 2010 highs at 0.065 and Gold would reach $2000, our small cap index would just about double. That is right, a potential 100% gain. The bottom line is small cap gold stocks have completed a textbook breakout and retest. As we said, the market will likely have a hard slog for the next several months as it encounters supply from the 2011 correction. If and when the market nears its old high it will have built up the necessary strength and momentum to embark on an explosive breakout. Thus, now is the time to be doing your due diligence to find and research those candidates to lead the market in a potential rip roaring move into 2013.

2012-03-13,"HUI, XAU No Longer Adequately Represent the Mining Stock Universe","By Jordan Roy-Byrne These indices are failing to represent precious metals equities as a whole. They're polluted by the dramatic underperformance of certain companies, which is not a reflection of gold stock fundamentals. The underperformance of gold stocks was a hot topic at PDAC and continues to dominate discussion in industry circles. As to why the sector is underperforming, we hear numerous reasons. The conspiracy crowd will claim manipulation or hedge fund shorting. More well-reasoned thoughts include the struggle of large miners to adequately replace reserves and grow production and the continued issuance of shares. At my firm we believe one key reason is that the bull market is in the wall-of-worry phase, and in this phase valuations compress as investors are nervous about, among other things, another major correction. The HUI is trading at 15x trailing earnings and only 13x 2012 earnings. If the market returned to the historical average valuation of 28x earnings, then share prices would double (and that assumes present earnings). Yet, does the HUI or XAU even adequately represent the mining stock universe anymore? The HUI is the go-to index for the sector but it is failing to represent precious metals equities as a whole. The HUI is currently trading at the same level as in November 2009. That means it has made no net progress in 27 months! In the same time period, gold is up 42%. The junior ETF (GDXJ) is up only marginally. The (CDNX) is up only 15%. I don't know about you but I can think of numerous companies that have performed fantastically in the same period. One problem is that these indices are being polluted by the dramatic underperformance of certain companies, which is not a reflection of gold stock fundamentals. Newmont Mining (NEM), which is a percentage of numerous indices, is at the same price as it was in 1996. Kinross Gold (KGC), Agnico-Eagle (AEM) and IAMGOLD (IAG) have fallen 40% or more in just the past six months. This performance has little to due with negative sector fundamentals, yet it has a negative effect on the index and can greatly distort a correct analysis of the gold stocks. Being sick and tired of the HUI, XAU, and gold miners ETF (GDX), and basically any of these indices, we decided to create our own. This equal-weighted index includes 10 of the largest, best-performing gold companies. It is up about 40% in that 27-month period. The index closed Friday at 80 and we see a confluence of support at 68, which is also the 38% retracement from the 2008 low to 2011 high. We've relied on our own proprietary silver stock index for a while. (SIL), the silver stock ETF, is not too bad but it is exposed to Hecla (HL), Pan American (PAAS), Silver Standard (SSRI), and Couer D'Alene (CDE). These are four companies that have dramatically underperformed silver in the past four years. Our index (shown below) contains 10 silver producers that are focused on growth. The underperformance of the mining stocks occurred in the 1970s and is occurring again. As we've argued countless times, there is no historical record of the large mining stocks outperforming. Mining is an extremely difficult business and even more so the larger the firm. It is the law of numbers. It is difficult to grow from a large starting point. Smartly, large gold miners are starting to increase dividends. They aren't attracting growth investors so they decided to seek out value investors. This is a smart move. Nevertheless, as you can see from our indices, there are many companies that are actually outperforming. The market of precious metals equities is not limited to the HUI or XAU. There are hundreds and hundreds of other companies out there. Moreover, it is very important to note that the large miners did not go parabolic in the late 1970s. The Barron's Gold Mining Index performed well but actually performed better in the 1960s. The reason is because the last third of a bull market sees increasing speculation. It was the juniors and small cap miners that received the speculative interest. At some point the market will diverge and the smaller miners will outperform the large caps. This is why we are focused on the smaller companies, which show value and excellent growth potential.

2012-03-15,Gold Miners Try To Claw Out Of A Hole,"The leading gold mining stocks have plummeted lower since since February 29, 2012. At that time, the highly traded Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) was trading around the $58.00 level. Yesterday, the GDX traded below the $50.00 area which is a sharp decline in such a short period of time. This morning, the GDX is trading higher by 0.22 cents to $50.34 a share. Short term traders can watch for intra-day resistance around the $50.50, and $51.00 levels. The daily chart is short term oversold, however, it is still in a very weak technical position. Other leading gold mining stocks that are trading higher include Goldcorp Inc (NYSE: GG), and Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE: AUY). Some leading gold miners that are weak today include Randgold Resources Ltd (NASDAQ: GOLD), and Royal Gold Inc (NYSE: RGLD). All of these leading stocks are very oversold in the near term.

2012-03-22,"Avoid These ETFs For Now (FXI, TVIX, GDXJ)","The reality is we live in an instant gratification world and the financial markets are no exception. If anything, the markets are perpetrators of the please me now outlook so many of us have. No big deal because there is clearly something to be said in favor of short-term trading. On the other hand, trading for the sake of trading is not a sound risk management philosophy and sometimes it pays to know what to avoid as it is knowing what to embrace. That's what we're looking at here: A few ETFs that have particularly bleak prospects over the next several weeks that have the near-term avoid label. VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (NYSE: TVIX) The level of controversy surrounding volatility ETNs is just too much to make them worth embracing. Like leveraged ETFs such as the Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: FAS), volatility ETNs like TVIX are best left to the pros. When an ETN drops more than 12% in a single day in part because its net asset value got a little rich, it's probably best to leave this thing alone. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) This is one a lot of traders clearly have on their personal avoid/sell short lists and that much is highlighted by what has become a grizzly performance over the past month. The knock on ETFs such as the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF and its large-cap cousin, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has been that they don't do a good job of tracking gold prices on the upside. In twist of the dagger, these ETFs do respond to gold futures selling off. Let's say this: GDXJ was near $29 when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke quashed hopes for QE3 in February. The ETF is at $24 today and looks poised to test its 52-week low. Don't be fooled by what looks like an inviting yield. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) The problem with the Materials Select Sector SPDR at the moment is two-fold. First, the ETF's chart shows technical vulnerability. Second, this an ETF that should be responding to positive U.S. economic data more than it is. XLB is being hamstrung by weakness in Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), two of its top-10 holdings. Until those two names, Freeport in particular, get their acts together, XLB is in for near-term weakness. iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) There are plenty of reasons to be avoiding the China pain train right now and plenty of ETFs where a short or sidelines approach is warranted. Actually, there are nearly 230 ETFs offering China exposure, but FXI, the largest China fund makes the list today. Yes, Chinese equities have cheaper valuations right now than broader emerging markets universe. The broader Chinese market is also down over the past year and the macro environment is not supportive of more upside in the here and now. We're not forecasting a new bear market for Chinese stocks, but we will say better prices will be available for FXI in the coming weeks."
2012-04-02,Is Gold Overpriced Relative to Other Commodities?,"Gold stocks are quite popular among hedge funds these days, and with good reason. John Paulson, who is very bullish about gold, made $5 billion by betting on gold in 2010. As of December 31, 2011, the largest position in the 13F portfolio of his Paulson & Co was the gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), in which Paulson had over $2.6 billion invested. Besides Paulson, there were 55 other money managers bullish about SPDR Gold Trust. In total, they had $8.2 billion invested in the position. Another gold ETF, Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), was also popular with hedge funds last year. It was held by 41 hedge funds at the end of last year. In addition to ETFs, hedge funds were also bullish about companies engaged in producing gold, such as Barrick Gold Corporation (ABX) and Newmont Mining Corp (NEM). There were over 40 hedge funds with these two positions in their 13F portfolios at the end of 2011. For instance, David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital had $60+ million invested in Barrick while Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies had nearly $90 million invested in Newmont. Other gold stocks with significant hedge fund interest are Goldcorp (GG), Kinross Gold (KGC), Allied Nevada Gold (ANV), and AngloGold Ashanti (AU). But, is gold truly worth investing in? Or, is it overpriced relative to other commodities? Let's check it out by comparing the historical prices of the gold and commodity indexes. We are going to use spot gold prices and two commodity indexes: S&P GSCI (Goldman Sachs Commodity Index) and CCI (Thomson Reuters Equal Weight Continuous Commodity Index). S&P GSCI is a broad-based index mainly weighted in energy (80%), agriculture (10%), industrial metals (6%), and precious metals (2%). CCI is comprised of 17 commodity futures that are continuously rebalanced to maintain equal weighting. Unlike GSCI, which can overweight the energy sector, CCI provides relatively even exposure to all commodity subgroups (energy 18%, metals 24%, soft commodities 29%, and agriculture 29%). Gold vs. GSCI We collected daily data points of spot gold prices and GSCI from January 8, 1991 to March 23, 2012 and plotted the values we obtained (see the graph of gold price vs. GSCI). Gold price and GSCI tracked each other closely before late 2008. After that, the price of gold went up rapidly while GSCI grew at a relatively slow pace. As a result, the gold-price-to-GSCI ratio has gone up to a higher level in recent years. As of March 23, 2012, the gold-price-to-GSCI ratio is 2.37, 25% lower than its peak of 3.18 on February 23, 2009 but still 35% higher than its historical average of 1.75. Gold vs. CCI Gold looks a bit overpriced compared with other commodities when using GSCI, an index has higher weight on energy. Now, let's compare the gold price with an equally weighted commodity index, CCI. Similarly, we collected daily data points of gold prices and CCI from December 29, 1978 to March 23, 2012.Gold prices grew abnormally high in January 1980 to about $850 per ounce due to high inflation, high oil prices, and the termination of the direct convertibility of the dollar to gold. The price of gold has also gone up much faster than CCI since late 2008. Therefore, the gold-price-to-CCI ratio has a peak of 3.02 on December 7, 2011 and it also reached 2.93 earlier on January 21, 1980. As of March 23, 2012, the ratio is 2.89 which is 74% higher than its historical average of 1.66 (see the gold/CCI graph). Overall, the price of gold has been on an uphill trend over the past decade, but it grew much more rapidly than other commodities only in recent years. Gold market is very liquid and it also doesn't cost a lot to store it. Gold supply is also pretty inelastic which makes it a good long-term play on inflation. These may be the reasons why investors preferred gold over other commodities. Our calculations showed that gold is overpriced relative to other commodities. This doesn't mean that gold prices are going to go down though. Considering that there were no supply side shocks after September 2008 that would explain the 100% increase in gold prices relative to commodities we think investors would be better off by betting on commodities and shorting gold."
2012-04-05,Is It Safe to Start Buying Gold Stocks Yet?,"By David Banister One of the most common questions I field is: Can we buy gold stocks yet? We have seen gold consolidating and correcting following a 34-month Fibonacci rally which I said last fall was going to top out around $1,900 per ounce. This type of rally went from October of 2008 to August of 2011 and we saw gold rally from $680 to $1,900 per ounce during that time. In order to work off the bullish sentiment that was at parabolic extremes, gold is required to spend a reasonable amount of time in relation to the prior 34-month move to wash out the sentiment and create a strong pivot bottom. While this continues, the gold stock index has taken it on the chin as money rotates out and into other hot areas like technology and the Internet 2.0 social media boom. To wit, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) peaked out last fall around 67 and currently trades under 47 as of this writing. However, there may be a silver lining developing in those dark mining-stock clouds very soon. It does appear that we are in the fifth and final wave of this pessimistic decline in gold stocks per my GDX ETF chart below. A typical bottoming pattern ends after five clear waves have taken place, and in this case I have targets between $43-$47 per GDX share for a likely pivot low in gold stocks. Contrarian investors may do well to begin picking the better names in the sector and “scaling in” over the next short period of time. Gold itself has recently corrected from $1,793 per ounce to $1,620 in the last several weeks. This has spooked the crowd out of gold and put further pressure on the gold mining stocks as well. Should gold hold the $1620s area and rebound past $1,691, you will see the gold stocks take off just ahead of that, and from these 43-46 levels on the GDX ETF, provide very strong returns to investors with iron stomachs. The best way to make money long term in the market and to grow your capital is to develop a method where you can define your risk levels within reason near the apex of a downside move, and then scale into that final apex and catch the rally on the upside. This is difficult to do but my firm developed a strong methodology that takes advantage of “herd behavioral characteristics” and takes advantage of typical panic selling and panic buying to do just the opposite. We have not yet bought into the gold stock sector, but I assume fairly soon we will be dipping our toes in the water while others have all rushed out of the sector right near the apex lows.

2012-04-18,Bold ETF Call Of The Day: Embracing Gold Miners,"It's no secret that ETFs tracking gold miners have significantly lagged their physically-backed counterparts. That much is proven by this statistic: In the past year, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the largest physically-backed gold ETF in the world, is up 9.2% while the Market Vectors Gold ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is off 23.4%. The miners vs. gold price conundrum has confounded both analysts and investors, making any bullish call on the disappointing miners bold to say the least. On the other hand, some might argue that the miners offer superior risk/reward compared to gold-backed ETFs going forward. That's the position of Street One Financial President Scott Freeze who discussed the potential virtues of the gold miners with Benzinga today. If you look at miners on a historical basis, they go through periods of lagging gold futures and then a period of substantial outperformance, Freeze said. We've seen capitulation with the miners, we've already been there. Since the miners have already been lagging, they offer more upside than downside now compared to a fund like GLD. Regarding gold mining ETFs, Freeze has a preference for the unheralded Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG). The Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF debuted 13 months ago, but has just $4.6 million in assets under management compared to over $8 billion for GDX. Freeze noted that GGGG's 26 equity holdings are all pure play gold miners, but GDX holds several silver miners including Silver Wheaton (NYSE: SLW) and Pan American Silver (Nasdaq: PAAS). GGGG's largest holding is El Dorado Gold (NYSE: EGO). Noting that an inflationary environment could hit investors sometime over the next 15 months because of previous rounds of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, Free said gold is poised to outperform the other precious metals. Gold itself will outperform other metals and GGGG should outperform GDX though GDX should do better than GLD, according to Freeze. Gold prices have slid recently, sending GLD down 1.18% in the past month while the rival iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) is off 1.24% over the same time, but that may not have the impact on the bottom lines of miners because many effectively hedged their production by selling gold futures contracts to lock in higher prices late last year and early this year. The gold miners are already hedged by having sold gold futures contracts. They're still locked in at a higher future price, Freeze said. We've heard about some foreign companies that have done that and it bodes well for upside in the miners. Regarding silver, Freeze said Europe's sovereign debt crisis could hamper silver production and he ranks silver third in terms of preference of the four precious metals behind gold and palladium. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), the largest ETF backed by physical silver, has slid 3.25% in the past month. The ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) and the ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT) are both down more than 5.5% over the same time. Regarding the gold miners, Freeze said investors need to assess the risk/reward scenario. Investors should be looking at pure risk/reward, he said. GLD is more expensive while GGGG has been lagging, but its underlying components should beat expectations. There's more upside and less downside with the miners compared to the physical gold ETFs.

2012-05-03,Beyond EZA: Alternative South Africa ETF Plays,"Broadly speaking, investing in South Africa, an emerging market on a continent chock full of volatile frontier markets, has proven rewarding over the past decade. While not without the usual hiccups experienced by emerging markets ETFs in recent years, the iShares MSCI South Africa Index Fund (NYSE: EZA), the lone South Africa-specific ETF on the market, has gained nearly 250% since its February 2003 debut. Since then, South Africa has seen its economic stock rise. The resource-rich country is not only by far the largest African economy, it has the distinction of having joined Brazil, Russia, India and China in the BRICS acronym. Today, South Africa still offers opportunity for investors, but not without a mixed bag feel about the situation. The country is arguably politically volatile and unemployment is almost 24%. On the other hand, Africa's share of global foreign direct investment has been steadily climbing over the past decade with South Africa being the primary destination for foreign inflows. Regarding ETFs, the P/E ratio for EZA's components is currently 17, indicating the South African equities found in this fund are more richly valued than the holdings of the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ) and the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI). EZA's price/book ratio is nearly double that of FXI's. So it can be said that South African stocks aren't cheap relative to their emerging markets. With that, let's examine ETFs that help investors gain some South Africa exposure without an entire commitment to country as is found with EZA. First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (NYSE: PLTM) We profiled the unheralded First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund earlier this year and the ETF proceeded to gain about 10% immediately following that piece. PLTM has slid since early March as investors have dialed back their appetites for risk, but the ETF remains a valid way to get exposure to South Africa. Not only is South Africa the world's largest platinum-producing country, its the second-largest palladium producer behind Russia. PLTM also offers significant palladium exposure and South Africa represents nearly 30% of the ETF's country weight. If PLTM breaks support at $18, it's time to bail. EGShares Consumer Services GEMS ETF (NYSE: VGEM) The knock on the EGShares Consumer Services GEMS ETF is obvious: It's thinly-traded, so much so that it doesn't trade everyday. Still, VGEM is up almost 19% year-to-date as emerging markets consumer ETFs have flourished. In fact, VGEM has dramatically outperformed the EGShares Emerging Markets Consumer ETF (NYSE: ECON), arguably the best of the EM consumer ETF lot in terms of AUM and liquidity. South Africa accounts for 25% of VGEM's weight. South Africa looms large in ECON as well with an allocation north of 17%. PowerShares S&P Emerging Markets Low Volatility ETF (NYSE: EELV) In the rapidly expanding world of low volatility ETFs investors looking for exposure to South Africa have some options. EELV is probably the best as the new fund allocates almost 20% of its weight to South Africa, more than double the concentration offered by the rival iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Minimum Volatility Index Fund (NYSE: EELV). Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG) It's no secret that South Africa is one of the world's largest gold producers and it's no secret that gold mining stocks have struggled mightily compared to gold futures and physically-backed ETFs. Should that trend reverse course, and we're not promising that it will anytime soon, GGGG and its almost 14% weight to South Africa, might be the preferred option. GGGG, which is just 14 months old, has easily outpaced the larger Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) this year. Again, that's not saying much."
2012-05-04,"4 Inverse ETFs For Sell In May (BZQ, DZZ, FXP)","May 4 is turning out to be one of those days that are good for one thing: Helping traders and investors come to grips with reality and the realities in this case are two-fold. First, it's unfortunately obvious that caution, not ebullience is the order of the day when it comes to U.S. economic data. Second, the phenomenon known as Sell in May and go away could be a real problem this, if Friday's action is any indication. Selling in May isn't the worst thing in the world for those that are properly prepared and ETFs certainly offer myriad avenues for that preparation. We've previously highlighted multiple funds, including some inverse plays that have the look of worthy sell in May plays. Today, we're building on that theme with a list comprised of entirely of inverse and leveraged ETFs that could prove to be highly profitable short-term trades if the market has to endure an acute case of the summertime doldrums. ProShares UltraShort MSCI Brazil (NYSE: BZQ) Remember the time when ETFs such as the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ) and the Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: BRF) were sporting year-to-date gains of almost 20%? Yeah, it's hard to remember, but it was sometime in February. These days, EWZ is clinging to positive territory on a year-to-date basis. The charts for EWZ, BRF and other long Brazil funds are simply broken at the moment. On the other hand, BZQ is up more than 6% in the past two days alone. A move above $17.50 and BZQ will samba even more to the upside. Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST) DUST doesn't get a lot of press, which is odd considering its volume is better than fair at almost 238,000 shares per day. Even more odd is the fact that everyone and his sister knows that gold mining ETFs such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) have stunk up the joint this year and the charts for these funds indicate more downside is on the way. Up 29% year-to-date, DUST is arguably one of the best leveraged ETFs no one has talked about. PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) The ProShares UltraShort Silver (NYSE: ZSL) made our previous list of sell in May and go away candidates and even though ETFs such as the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) are higher today, the technical outlook is still murky at best for gold futures. If gold fails to break resistance at $1,670 an ounce or fails to hold support at $1,630, DZZ immediately becomes an attractive short-term play. ProShares UltraShort FTSE China 25 (NYSE: FXP) The iShares MSCI China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) has an interesting track record in May-October time frame over the past several years. The largest China ETF was badly beaten in that period in 2008, but was a stellar performer a year later. FXI inched higher in May-October 2010 and was again taken to the woodshed last year. Where we're going with this is FXI doesn't look like a bowl of cherries right now and Chinese stocks have clearly been hurt by sell in May and go away in the past. If FXI breaks $36, FXP becomes all the more attractive. Or swing for the fences with the Direxion Daily China Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: YANG). For more on inverse ETFs, please click HERE."
2012-05-08,"Bust A Move: Inverse ETFs Breaking Out (FAZ, BZQ, SCC)","ETF critics either don't know, overlook or intentionally ignore a key advantage of these products: They alleviate the burden of stock-picking for investors looking to establish long positions. Fortunately, inverse ETFs present traders and investors with the same advantage on the downside. Inverse country and sector ETFs allow traders to exploit downside themes without the need for identifying the single best bearish play at the stock level. To be sure, inverse and leveraged ETFs require due diligence and the realization these are short-term trading vehicles. With that important disclaimer out of the way, recent weakness in U.S. equities has damaged the charts of plenty of marquee stocks along with a large number of traditional long country and sector funds. Said differently, some of the best looking charts in the ETF universe at the moment are found with inverse funds. Consider the following: ProShares UltraShort Brazil (NYSE: BZQ) Indeed, we just highlighted BZQ a few days ago, but the chart keeps on improving for this double-leveraged inverse play. That is to say the charts for Brazil funds such as the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ) keep getting worse, not better. On Monday, Benzinga noted that EWZ was down about 17% from its 2012 peak and that a 20% decline from that top puts the ETF in bear territory. Well, EWZ is down another 2% today we're getting closer to bear market territory. While EWZ is breaking down, BZQ is trying to breakout. Late comeers should watch for a move above $18, which could foretell a move to $20. Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) Can you remember the last time anyone had anything to say about the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) or the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ)? We can't either. On a seemingly daily basis, GDX and GDXJ make new 52-week lows. Gold miners underperformed gold futures on the upside and now that gold is being treated as a risk asset, the miners are getting slammed on the yellow metal's downside. There very well could be a day when gold's safe haven status is restored and the miners rally. Problem is that day isn't likely to arrive in the next week or even the next month. DUST is simply the best way to play the miners at this juncture. ProShares UltraShort Oil & Gas (NYSE: DUG) Arguing against the long-term bull case for oil stocks is tricky business. In the near-term, however, concerns about Europe's sovereign debt crisis and U.S. and Chinese economic growth are killing oil prices. Of course, that's bad news for funds such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE), the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP) and comparable rivals. As those charts have broken down, DUG's has improved in impressive fashion. Watch for DUG to take out its 200-day moving average and offer more near-term upside. ProShares UltraShort Consumer Services (NYSE: SCC) Give high-end retail and discretionary names some credit. They've held up pretty well. Until today that is. As just three examples, the charts of Coach (NYSE: COH), Michael Kors (NYSE: KORS) and Tiffany (NYSE: TIF) are unappealing right now. SCC is the way to play this trend. For those that need convincing, consider this: SCC's average daily volume is about 8,000 shares. More than 39,000 shares in the ETF have already changed hands today. Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: FAZ) Hopefully, the Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares will never see the $700 area as it did back in early 2009. It probably won't, but bank stocks were leaders in the first quarter. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) was the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in Q1. Welcome to Q2 and sell in May and go away. Bank of America? Hammered. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF)? Vulnerable at best. FAZ just took out its 50-day moving average, perhaps indicating more upside is on the way. For more on inverse ETFs, please click HERE."
2012-05-11,Bye-Bye Birdie: 5 ETFs Seeing Massive Redemptions,"There's no getting around the fact that assets under management for exchanged-traded products are growing. The nearly 1,460 U.S.-listed ETFs and ETNs had over $1.2 trillion in combined AUM at the end of April, according to data from the ETF Industry Association. That's up from $1.1 trillion a year earlier and $846.7 billion in April 2010. Impressive growth to be sure, but not all ETFs are getting on the action. In fact, some ETFs have seen rapid paces of redemptions in the past year. Not surprisingly, some of the worst offenders in terms of redemptions are offenders when it comes to performance as well. That stands to reason as redemption of an ETF is akin to selling a stock and when a lot of redemptions occur in a single ETF, it's equivalent to sellers outnumbering buyers in individual stocks. The result is the ETF's price go down. Along those lines, fund flows data can be instructive, though the caveat is not always 100% accurate. For example, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) ranks among the top-10 ETFs for share creations over the past year. In that time, GDX has lost 21.3%. When it comes to those funds seeing big redemptions since May 2011, almost all are in the red. Just look at these culprits. Market Vectors Coal Miners ETF (NYSE: KOL) Investors apparently got the memo that low natural gas prices coupled with the slowing Chinese and Indian economies would not be good news for KOL and its constituents. That much is highlighted by the ETFs 38.5% slide in the past year and the fact that KOL currently rests less than $2 above its 52-week. KOL will start today with $180.4 million in AUM. In early May 2011, that number was over $581 million. iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ) EWZ and its Brazil ETF brethren have had their share of problems recently. Still, EWZ was the third-largest emerging markets ETF overall and the largest-country specific fund (excluding funds tracking the S&P 500) at the end of April. That meant EWZ almost $8.6 billion in AUM. That number has since fallen to $8 billion. At the end of April 2011, EWZ had almost $13.2 billion in AUM. EWZ is down 20% in the past year. iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund (NYSE: EWJ) There might yet prove to be value among Japanese equities. Then again, some folks have been saying that for years and the bull case has never really materializes. We know this much: EWJ is trading lower than where it was in the days immediately following the natural disasters that struck Japan last year. EWJ is down 8.4% since May 2011, but its AUM has slid much worse on a percentage basis. At the end of April 2011, EWJ had $7.5 billion in assets. As of May 10, that number was less than $5.3 billion. iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) It was less than 13 months ago that SLV was flirting with $47. Maybe it was manipulation in the silver market, maybe was increased margin requirements or a combination of both that led to silver's 2011 demise. Whatever the reason, SLV had $17.2 billion in AUM at the end of April 2011. It had less than $9 billion as of May 10. No, it's not surprising that the fund is down 18% in the past year when seeing that type of AUM decline. Maybe the question should be why isn't SLV down more? Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) With the recent plunge in West Texas Intermediate, NYMEX oil futures have turned negative on the year. Oddly enough, in the past three months, equity-based XLE has performed almost twice as worse as the futures-based U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO). An interesting phenomenon and one that underscores the notion investors aren't satisfied with integrated oil stocks. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) account for 34% of XLE's weight. That may or may not be a reason for XLE's AUM tumble, but the tumble has occurred. From April 30, 2011 to April 30, 2012 XLE saw its AUM haul dwindle to $7.7 billion from $10.4 billion. Another $1.1 billion has been pulled from the fund since the start of May."
2012-05-11,What Happens When ETFs Return to Their Debut Prices?,"It has been said hundreds of times, probably more, that new ETFs should not be treated like hot IPOs for individual stocks. What that means is investors don't need to be involved with a new ETF on its first day of trading. While there's no hard and fast set of guidelines for exactly when the time is right to become involved with a new ETF or ETN, in most cases it's safe to let the first week of trading pass without getting involved. In many instances, it's advisable to let a new ETF age for a month or longer before pulling the trigger on a buy order. That advice highlights a stark difference between new exchanged-traded products and IPOs for individual stocks, but there is one similarity between the two asset classes: The usefulness of the debut price. Applying the theory that once-hot IPOs that return to the price at which the shares debuted often leads to increased selling pressure, we screened for ETFs that, at some point in their respective life spans, have fallen back to their launch prices. What we were hoping to discover is whether or not an ETF's return to its debut price is an efficacious short signal or if that area acts as some kind of mental support. For now, we've only included five ETFs. Our screen excluded inverse and leveraged products, ETFs and ETNs that have undergone reverse splits and includes only funds that are at least a year old. iShares MSCI Italy Index Fund (NYSE: EWI) The lone Italy-specific ETF debuted in March 1996 around $13.50, but it took more than five years for the ETF to trade below its debut and even then the flirtation was brief. EWI repeated the offense again during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, though plenty of ETFs did the same, so we'll be nice and give EWI a pass. However, we won't give EWI a pass for its most recent break of $13.50, which occurred in March. It might be the last time this ETF breaks its introduction price because at $11.25 and given the Euro Zone's debt woes, it could take a miracle for EWI to see its debut price anytime soon. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) Traders that don't live under a rock know that gold miners have dramatically underperformed gold futures for more than a year now and that situation shows no signs of reversing anytime soon. GDXJ, which will turn three in November, is still home to almost $2 billion in AUM, but another statistic needs to be highlighted. That is that while most folks are talking about the ETF making new 52-week lows, the reality is these new lows are ALL-TIME lows. GDXJ debuted at $25 and the first time it traded below there, it rallied. The second time, late last year, it rallied. The third time in March was the ominous charm as GDXJ is now flirting with $20. Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE: VGK) The Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF was priced at $50 when it debuted in March 2005, a level that has been violated several times for myriad reasons, but the ETF has also found a way to reclaim that debut price. VGK is home to plenty of European-based companies that qualify as blue chip but that doesn't change the fact that they're still European companies. It has been 10 months since VGK last resided above $50. iShares MSCI Thailand Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: THD) We're making an exception with one of the best emerging markets ETFs on the market. THD debuted at $50 in the late part of the first quarter of 2008. Let's just say there are better times for an emerging markets ETF to have come to market because it took THD 17 months to get back above $50. Since the market bottom in 2009, THD has been one of the best ETFs on the market, emerging markets or otherwise and while it has taken its lumps in the past couple of weeks, the long-term outlook for this ETF and the country it tracks are bright. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF hasn't traversed its 2006 debut price of around $38 since the commodities bubble burst in 2008. That sent the ETF tumbling below $18. It's a different world today, so a decline that substantial probably isn't the cards for GDX. However, it must be noted GDX did touch a new 52-week low earlier this week. Combine that with the decline in gold futures and it's not unrealistic to see the selling pressure on GDX intensify if it breaks $38 again."
2012-05-16,Can Things Get Any Worse For Mining ETFs? ,"It's an oft-pondered riddle: How can the shares of mining stocks lag and even fall when the prices of the metals they mine rise? A vexing scenario to be sure and one that gives to way to the harsh reality that if ABC Corp. mines gold or silver and it's stock price doesn't go up in conjunction with the futures price, then it's a lock that ABC's shares are going to be in for significant selling pressure when the price of the metal it extracts from the earth falls. Welcome to that reality. In recent days, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), the two largest ETFs backed by physical holdings of the precious metals in their titles, have given up all of their 2012 gains and turned negative on the year. Those declines began in earnest in March and have accelerated rapidly since the start of April, forming a tidal wave that has sent gold and silver mining ETFs tumbling in even more dramatic fashion. There have been bold calls in defense of the mining ETFs, but to this point, sticking one's neck out for these funds has been akin to volunteering to go to the guillotine. Here's how the landscape for gold and silver mining ETFs shapes up at the moment starting with the group's largest fund, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). GDX will observe its sixth birthday on May 16, but there's not much reason to celebrate. Following Tuesday's 4% drop, the ETF is trading below its $40 debut price, something we've established is a bearish sign. GDX traded as low as $17.80 in 2008 and while it would be a bold call to say the ETF falls that much further, it's worth noting the RSI on GDX's daily chart has only recently started to show an oversold condition. Some have made a bull case for GDX's technicals but that's a dangerous game to play at the moment. As for the Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE: GLDX), let's just say this is a case of bad timing. The fund debuted in November 2011 and has managed to lose almost 58% since then. Tuesday's close at $7.10 wasn't just a 52-week low, it was an all-time low. We should also take this opportunity to welcome the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) to the all-time low club as well. Believe it or not, investors have been putting new capital to work in this ETF. To be precise, GDXJ has seen $90.3 million in inflows over the past week, according ETF Channel data. These days, purchases of GDXJ include an invitation to the catch a falling knife competition as the fund has lost 18% in the past week alone. Making things all the more inviting for short sellers is the fact that, like GDX, GDXJ has only just become oversold and at these levels, there may not be any support until the $14-$15 area. Not surprisingly, silver mining ETFs, of which there are two, have not been peaches either. The Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) lost 5% on volume that was nearly double the daily average on Tuesday. Once SIL violated support at $20 earlier this month, that was one more sign this party was going to turn nasty. This was a $26 ETF in March, To be fair, SIL is not the only silver mining ETF offender. The iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP), which isn't even four months old, has lost a third of its value since its late January debut and is home to less than $2 million in AUM. SIL and SPLV have seen more in the way of redemptions than creations, recently. Duh. Both funds have been damaged by their allocations to Silver Wheaton (NYSE: SLW), Coeur d'Alene (NYSE: CDE) and Pan American Silver (Nasdaq: PAAS), to name a few. Making matters worse are recent statements made on Monday by the World Gold Council that miners need bullion to trade at $1,300 an ounce to survive and will need gold to jump to $3,000 an ounce in five years to remain profitable. That's almost a double from current levels. As investors already know, even if gold and silver get their respective acts together and start marching higher once again, there are no guarantees the miners will follow suit. That much has already been proven. For more on gold mining ETFs, please click HERE."

2012-06-04,Reversal in Gold Mining ETFs Could be Bullish Indicator,"Last Wednesday, gold futures hammered out a swing bottom at $1,532. In fact, the precious metal had found support in this area a couple of previous times in May. After putting in this low, gold has been moving aggressively higher and some interesting price action last Friday could be suggesting that prices are going to continue to surge. On that day, gold futures soared around 4% while the Dow fell nearly 300 points. This may be suggesting that investors are shifting their perception of gold once again and are looking at it as a safe-haven asset. Prior to the recent sell-off in risky assets and the corresponding pop in the VIX, gold was trading like most other risk assets and was highly correlated to the S&P 500 and the EUR/USD. The strange price action on Friday seemed to be suggesting that gold may de-couple from other risk assets and benefit from safe-haven flows, similar to what happened in July and August of last year. During Monday's trading session, gold futures are holding the flat-line, just above $1,620. Gold miners, however, are seeing bullish price action as the broader market has turned around in afternoon trade. Both the Market Vectors ETF Trust (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are now trading in positive territory after reversing earlier losses. Both are also sitting at 5-day highs with the GDX trading at its best levels in over a month. Given the interesting activity in the gold market, these two securities could potentially be poised to climb this week. If gold can get back into its former sweet-spot, where it went up on risk aversion as well as bullish economic sentiment, big profits could be ahead in both gold futures as well as the mining ETFs."
2012-06-06,"ECB, BoC, RBA, Fed: Central Bank Watch 2.0, Predicting More Twist","On Monday, I highlighted that this week was was full of central bank activity, with speeches from officials and rate decisions around the world. So far, the Bank of Canada, the Royal Bank of Australia, and the European Central Bank have all reported, so let us recap the decisions there. Also, many Fed members have been speaking this week, so let us discuss their statements and potential policy actions. First, I apologize, I had the date wrong on the RBA announcement on Monday, but even so, I did preview it. However, the first central bank to report was the Bank of Canada, which yesterday kept rates firm at 1% but took a very hawkish tone. However, the tone was not as hawkish as it was back at the April meeting, when economists thought that the BoC would raise rates in the next few months to fight rising inflation pressures and a booming economy led by employment growth. The Canadian Dollar rallied on the news and Canadian bonds sold off as yields rose. The continued growth in Canada will be bullish miners (NYSE: GDX), Canadian-exposed countries such as Potash (NYSE: POT), and Canadian-exposed energy companies such as Suncor Energy (NYSE: SU). The Royal Bank of Australia took a much more dovish stance than its Canadian counterparts, slashing rates for the second straight time. This cut was 25 bps following the 50 bps cut last month. With modest domestic growth and a weaker and more uncertain international environment, the outlook for inflation afforded scope for a more accommodative stance of monetary policy, Reserve Bank Governor Glenn Stevens said. What investors should read is that China is slowing which is spilling over to Australia through the slow down in end demand for commodities. Watch Australian-exposed miners such as BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP), Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), and Alcoa (NYSE: AA), and the Australian Dollar (NYSE: FXA). The big event was the ECB interest rate decision this morning, where President Mario Draghi elected to keep rates steady at 1% (which are record lows for the record) and did not announce any new crisis fighting measures. In fact, he seemed to indicate that the ECB will not act until the politicians come up with a scheme to solve the crisis. He has got to be worried seeing the events after the LTRO's: the ECB bought the politicians time, about three months, to come up with a grand plan, a solution, and they did nothing. Draghi has got to fear that the politicians would be unlikely to do anything unless there are severe crisis pressures. Draghi did hint that inflation expectations are still high, and he expects inflation between 2.3-2.5% this year, which is higher than the ECB's target of 2%. I have a theory that any deflationary pressures that would arise due to bank deleveraging are being exported via the weakness of currency (which is the biggest victim of the crisis so far, in my opinion), and the US and Japan will be the real sufferers of disinflation or outright deflation. Thus, due to this dynamic, the ECB will be all but reluctant to do anything that will be seen causing more inflation. “This decision was taken by consensus and the discussion was quite complete. It was taken by very broad consensus ... a few members would have preferred to have a rate cut today. He added further, “We are fully aware that the most recent soft data are [on the]downside. That is why you will find several references to downside risk. And we will monitor closely all developments and we stand ready to act. This week there has also been a lot of Fed member speeches. This morning, Atlanta Fed President and FOMC voting member Dennis Lockhart hinted that more fed easing is possible, following calls for aggressive, expansionary policy last night by the Chicago Fed's Charles Evans, who is an alternate voting member of the FOMC. Today, San Francisco Fed President John Williams (voting member) is set to speak and voting member Janet Yellen does as well. Tomorrow, Bernanke is speaking on the hill, Lockhart is set to speak again, Dallas Fed President Richard Fischer (non-voting member) is speaking on the global economy in California, and Narayana Kocherlakota, Minneapolis Fed President and non-voting member, is set to speak on monetary policy in Minneapolis. Investors should be watching these speeches tomorrow, as there may be hints of further Fed easing. Full-blown balance sheet expansion via the LSAP is unlikely on June 20, but the Fed could extend Operation Twist. Analysts say that the Fed could only continue Operation Twist for two more months, however if the Fed moves further down the curve, it can twist more. The Fed has been selling its holdings of sub-three year paper and buying long term paper to flatten the yield curve and induce more long-term borrowing for investment in hard assets."
2012-06-06,"5 Mining ETFs Your Broker Forgot to Mention (PSAU, GLDX, RING)","Sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's a bad thing, but it's clear that sentiment can change on a dime in this market. That has certainly proven to be a good thing recently for the shares of many precious metal miners and the ETFs that track them. Left for dead as recently as mid-May, it appears as though the miners not only have their respective acts together, but that they want to participate in the upside being offered by the metals they extract from the earth as well. Since May 15, the returns offered by the three major precious metal mining ETFs are nothing short of staggering and the numbers are all the more impressive when remembering this is a risk of, let's discard anything high beta market environment. Since May 15, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest precious metals mining ETF, has jumped more than 18%. GDX's junior counterpart, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is up more than 13% while the Globla X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) is flirting with a gain of 11%. That trio is the Big 3 of precious metals mining funds, but there are other options to consider in this space, some of which your broker is probably neglecting to mention. Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE: GLDX) For all the fanfare that mining ETFs have been subject to, the Global X Gold Explorers ETF has flown under the radar since its November 2010 debut. Today, the fund has almost $31.5 million in assets under management and has surged almost 15% in the past two weeks. As of this writing on June 6, GLDX is up almost 4% on volume that's nearly double the daily average indicating investors are starting to warm to this sub-$10 fund. GLDX is in fact quite different than GDX. The Global X fund offers no exposure to U.S.-based companies as Canada and Australia combine for essentially all of the fund's country weight. GLDX's top-10 holdings account for about 56% of the fund's weight and the ETF has an expense ratio of 0.65%. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG) The Quad G's is now 15 months old and isn't all that large with just $4.4 million in AUM, but this could be the time the unheralded fund solidifies itself. Up 15.2% since May 15, GGGG has outperformed GLDX and GDXJ over that time. GGGG is also cheaper than GLDX with an expense ratio of 0.59%. Home to almost 30 stocks, GGGG's country allocation is heavily tilted toward Canada and South Africa as those countries represent over 60% of the fund's weight. U.S. investors are probably familiar with some of the fund's top-10 holdings such as Eldorado Gold (NYSE: EGO), Kinross Gold (NYSE: KGC) and Allied Nevada (NYSE: ANV). Perhaps the most important thing to note about GGGG is that it has one of the lowest correlations to gold of any mining ETF, as ETFdb.com recently noted. PowerShares Global Gold and Precious Metals Portfolio (Nasdaq: PSAU) The PowerShares Global Gold and Precious Metals Portfolio has been around for almost four years and since this fund is a direct competitor to the dominant GDX, it often goes ignored. PSAU and GDX do have plenty of overlap in terms of holdings. For example, Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) and Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) are top-10 holdings in both ETFs. PSAU's 14.1% jump since May 15 is impressive, but that lags GDX, a situation we suspect is attributable to GDX's larger weights to select gold miners. The aforementioned trio of stocks accounts for over 43% of GDX's weight, but barely more than 25% of PSAU's girth. iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP) The iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund came to market earlier this year as a direct rival to the Global X Silver Miners ETF, but SLVP has struggled to attract assets. That should change as sentiment towards mining funds improves and it should be noted SLVP does have an advantage of SIL: The iShares product is cheaper. Still, it can't be ignored that since May 15, SLVP is up almost 6% (nice), but SIL is up almost 11% (better). iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund (NYSE: RING) Home to one of the more appropriate tickers in the ETF universe, the iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund debuted at the end of January as a direct rival to GDX and PSAU. Competing with GDX's first-to-market advantage is tough as that fund has almost $9 billion in AUM. To RING's credit, it has almost $31 million in AUM and is cheaper than both GDX and PSAU while holding many of the same stocks. More importantly and almost completely under the radar, RING has surged almost 18% since May 15, making it the second-best performer of all the funds we've highlighted here behind only GDX.

2012-06-06,Positioning Your Portfolio for More Fed Easing,"The recent mantra to Fed action was buy gold as a hedge against the dollar, but with the gold (NYSE: GLD) being the second-most crowded trade to (NASDAQ: AAPL), what are other alternatives? (Note: that's not an actual statistic, just an observation). There are many different views on the best hedges to the Fed, but let's see what the data has to say. Gold obviously is the winner, having nearly doubled from the 2008 lows through the end of QE2 and increasing another 14% during QE2. Miners have not performed as well, though small and mid cap miners (NYSE: GDXJ) have outperformed their larger cap (NYSE: GDX) brethren. Silver (NYSE: SLV) has lagged its yellow cousin, as it actually has industrial value. Really, only Apple has outperformed gold since the Fed has attempted to save the world. Another obvious trade is to short the dollar (NYSE: UUP), especially as the dollar has been strong recently. However, the dollar was stronger ahead of both of the quantitative easing programs, with the dollar index trading well north of 85 prior to each. The high so far has only been just over 83. The sell-offs following balance sheet expansion by the Fed have ended around 75, meaning that traders could pick up about 12% by shorting the dollar (NYSE: UDN). Shorting bonds have been the loser in all of this, with treasury bonds (NYSE: TLT) continuing to fall to record low yields. Being short bonds (NYSE: TBT) has been a losing trade, with the TBT down some 75% since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008. Mortgage Backed Securities (NYSE: MBB) have been winners, with the Barclays MBS Index rallying some 12.5% since the 2009 lows. However, with fed members hinting that the next round of easing could focus on MBS only, they may be a winner. Copper (NYSE: JJC) almost tripled after QE1 and other stimulus policies and rallied another 50% from there after QE2. Copper may be a place for investors to put some capital if they believe that more QE is on the way. Oil has also benefited from QE, and so have oil companies. For those wishing to have less volatility than commodities, investing in miners or energy companies (NYSE: XLE) may make more sense. In general, it will be a risk-on environment, so those wanting a more broad -based allocation to risk may wish to invest in a diversified portfolio, such as the UBS Fisher-Gartman Risk On ETN (NYSE: ONN). This ETN is a portfolio of various risk assets, such as Aussie Dollar (NYSE: FXA) futures, Canadian Dollar (NYSE: FXC) futures, crude oil, equities, and bonds. We know the playbook: buy gold, buy stocks, buy commodities. But now we know exactly which ones to buy. Good luck and good trading."
2012-06-07,Dissecting Bernanke's Comments: Central Bank Watch 3.1,"Chairman Bernanke's testimony on Capital Hill just ended, so let us recap what he said and what the implications are for further easing efforts by the Fed. Leading into the meeting, the market had high expectations of a new QE program, but as I pointed out on numerous occasions, it is much more likely that the Fed will extend Operation Twist into the four-year maturity, buying two more months to decide whether or not the economy needs more QE. Inflation expectations are not low enough for QE, which is designed to fight deflationary pressures. Bernanke's opening testimony was met with a sell-off from the markets, as he didn't explicitly hint at any new easing efforts, but clearly did not say that the Fed will do nothing. As Jamie Coleman of Forexlive wrote, The door is wide open to QE but he didn't drive through. The Q&A section was to be the real event, as his true opinions were to come out, and they did. On the employment situation, Bernanke said that the weakness in the labor markets reflects the end of a catch up period after the recession; he says that what is needed is growth at or above trend to continue improvement. On the Fiscal Cliff, the Chairman said that the measures amount to a withdrawal of between 3 and 5% of GDP. If no action is taken, the cuts still happen. On the effects of QE, Bernanke was pretty open, stating that analysis shows that QE in the past did ease financial conditions, successfully lowered rates, and narrowed the spread between sovereign and private sector borrowing. He said that QE2 successfully avoided deflation and restored inflation to near-target levels. On external shocks to the economy, he said it is nearly impossible to be prepared for every circumstance, but two that come to mind are an Israeli strike on Iran or a further deterioration of conditions in Europe. He fears that an Israeli strike would send oil prices sky-rocketing, which acts as a tax on consumers and would cause a significant drag on growth. As for Europe, he believes that the best thing we can do is make sure we are prepared. He said that US institutions have cut exposure to European sovereigns, but due to the nature of financial markets, are exposed to European banks, through which contagion could put strains on the US financial system. All in all, a bunch of the same-old, same-old from the chairman. He definitely did not close the door on QE but did not explicitly state that more easing is coming. What we learned from the Chairman is that he is a lot more relaxed about recent data globally than the market had predicted. He was clearly not as sour on the economic outlook as other Fed members have been in the last few days, and the market reaction proves this. Gold (NYSE: GLD) is down almost 3% on the news, as the recent run-up was simply due to increased expectations of further easing. Oil (NYSE: USO), after trading higher earlier, is now essentially flat on the day. Stocks (NYSE: SPY) are still up, but well off the highs, with miners (NYSE: GDX) and technology (NYSE: XLK) lagging. The yield on the ten-year bond (NYSE: TLT) has fallen to 1.646%. The dollar (NYSE: UUP) and the Yen (NYSE: FXY) are stronger on the news."
2012-06-07,"Under The Hood: An Unheralded Mining Play (TSXV, GDX)","Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke didn't do gold bugs any favors on Thursday when he refused to walk down Quantitative Easing Boulevard a third time. While the central bank chief did say the Fed stands ready to act, those comments cannot be taken to mean QE3 is imminent and that proved to be problematic for gold and gold miners. Ah, yes. The gold miners, home to so much good recently mining stocks and ETFs crumbled in the wake of what Bernanke did not say. Sure, it can be said the likes of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE: GDXJ) were near-term overbought and due for a pullback, but Thursday's action was quite nasty. However, traders might want to take advantage this distribution day to consider some backdoor approaches to gold miners. Let the dust settle for a day and then have a look at an ETF such as the IndexIQ Canada Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: CNDA) or the unheralded Global X S&P/TSX Venture 30 Canada ETF (NYSE: TSXV). The Global X S&P/TSX Venture 30 Canada ETF, which is just 15 months old and charges an expense ratio of 0.75% per year, isn't heavily traded, but the index employs a liquidity-driven weighting scheme and each stock must trade on average, at least 100,000 shares-per-month during the 6 months preceding the rebalance reference date, according to Standard & Poor's. So while TSXV's average daily volume of just 1,900 shares per day may seem off-putting, the fund's overall liquidity may prove to be a pleasant surprise to some. Not that this is an ETF for income investors, but TSXV has a 2.77% yield, a nice surprise as well, and that's better than what S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average tracking ETFs offer. As an ETF that embraces the commodities/materials aspect of the Canadian economy, TSXV has seen its shares slide 7.3% in the past month has the commodities trade has been punished. A 38% allocation to energy stocks has obviously been a problem for the fund, but TSXV's secret sauce for a potential rebound is its exposure to gold miners, something the ETF is rarely given credit for. Metals miner Rio Alto is TSXV's second-largest constituent with a weight of 11%. Of the ETF's top-12 holdings, ten are engaged in the mining of gold and silver and those stocks combine for over 40% of the fund's total weight. Overall, more than half of TSXV's weight is devoted to precious metals mining firms, implying this is an ETF that will benefit as the miners regain prominence and start either participating in gold and silver's upside or outperforming the underlying metals outright. TSXV's caveat isn't the volume or the fees, it's the oil exposure, which is to say more quantitative easing would surely help this fund because there's no getting around the fact that oil demand is slack at the moment. Looking at the chart, the $9.25-$9.60 area is probably safe to nibble on TSXV with a stop at $8.40. If the 200-day moving average is cleared, TSXV could run to $11.50-$12.

2012-06-29,ETFs Hedge Fund Titan John Paulson Would Love,"The ups and downs of John Paulson's eponymous hedge fund, Paulson & Co., are well-documented. Paulson rose to acclaim for his prescient bets against sub-prime mortgage securities. Paulson, who has not been known as the media's biggest fan, was featured on the cover of the latest issue of the Bloomberg Businessweek and was the subject of a wide-ranging interview. In the interview, he spoke a bit about his firm's recent struggles. Despite Paulson's legendary performance in 2008, his firm's two largest funds, Paulson Advantage and Advantage Plus, experienced dreadful 2011 performances. Paulson Advantage gave up 36 percent while Advantage Plus tumbled 52 percent according to Businessweek. However, Paulson & Co. did not become one of the largest U.S. hedge funds by consistently losing clients' money. For those that want to try their hands at outperforming Paulson, here are some ETFs the man himself might like. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) Paulson's bullish stance on gold is well-known. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) could also easily make this list because the fund was also among his firm's holdings at the end of the first quarter. Gold miners have drawn favor from Paulson & Co. as the firm held at least seven at the end of the first quarter, including Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and Gold Fields (NYSE: GFI). Overall, Paulson's first-quarter 13F filing indicates the firm's gold miner stakes comprise roughly a third of GDX's weight, making the ETF an ideal way for investors to mirror Paulson. Market Vectors Gaming ETF (NYSE: BJK) Paulson held stakes in two casino stocks – MGM Resorts (NYSE: MGM) and Caesars Entertainment (NYSE: CZR) – at the end of the first quarter. MGM is a top-10 holding in BJK, but Caesars has not made it into the ETF yet since returning as a public company earlier this year. Particularly in the case of Caesars, Paulson is betting on one of the more controversial casino stock as the company has $19 billion in debt, nearly quadruple the debt load of Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ: WYNN). Investors might want to wait to see if BJK can find a floor in the $30-$31 area before rushing into this fund, which has taken a double-digit loss since the start of the second quarter. iShares Dow Jones U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Index Fund (NYSE: IEO) Paulson did not hold a lot of energy stocks at the end of the first quarter and the hedge fund eliminated its entire position in Transocean (NYSE: RIG), the world's largest provider of offshore drilling services. The firm did, however, hold a stake in Anadarko Petroleum (NYSE: APC) at the end of Q1. Anadarko, one of the largest U.S. independent oil and natural gas producers, was Paulson & Co.'s seventh-largest holding, according to Whale Wisdom. Investors might note two facts about Paulson's Anadarko stake. First, Paulson &Co.'s Q1 13F filing showed that the hedge fund significantly reduced its position in the stock. Second, anyone that buys Anadarko at current levels would be getting superior pricing to what Paulson got. The firm added the stock in the first quarter of 2011 when it traded around $80. Friday, it traded closer to $65. Anadarko is IEO's third-largest holding with a weight of almost eight percent. ProShares UltraShort Euro (NYSE: EUO) Earlier this year, Paulson said in a letter to investors the euro is “structurally flawed,” and will eventually fall apart. He has put client money where his mouth is by betting against European sovereign debt and establishing a long position on credit default swaps used to insure that debt against default. Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: DEM) Paulson is known for shorting sub-prime mortgages, but he was quick to embrace the financial services sector just as the darkest clouds from the credit crisis appeared to have passed. Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), which combine for over 13 percent of XLF's weight, are found among Paulson's holdings. For more ETFs John Paulson might enjoy, click here."

2012-07-12,Top 10 Commodity Producers ETFs,"Commodity-based companies and associated ETFs are critically important as a gauge of economic health and demand, inflation and should be important additions to most investment portfolios. Underlying commodity prices can be affected by many factors including the level of the U.S. dollar which can depress prices when strong. With inflation pressures waxing and waning many believe it’s important to have exposure to commodity oriented stocks and ETFs. Nevertheless, even if underlying commodity prices rise, commodity related common stocks and linked ETFs may or may not follow suit. This makes investment timing that much more important. We feature a technical view of conditions from monthly chart views. Simplistically, we recommend longer-term investors stay on the right side of the 12 month simple moving average. When prices are above the moving average, stay long, and when below remain in cash or short. Some more interested in a fundamental approach may not care so much about technical issues preferring instead to buy when prices are perceived as low and sell for other reasons when high; but, this is not our approach. Members to the ETF Digest receive added signals when markets become extended such as DeMark triggers to exit overbought/oversold conditions. For traders and investors wishing to hedge, leveraged and inverse issues are available to utilize from ProShares and Direxion and where available these are noted. #10: First Trust Global Copper (NYSE: CU) CU follows the ISE Global Copper Index which is a linear weighted index following public companies in the copper mining industry based on analysis of revenue derived from the sale of copper.

Strong established linked index Excellent consistent performance and index tracking Low fee structure Strong portfolio suitability Excellent liquidity Established linked index even if “enhanced” Good performance or more volatile if “enhanced” index Average to higher fee structure Good portfolio suitability or more active management if “enhanced” index Decent liquidity Enhanced or seasoned index Less consistent performance and more volatile Fees higher than average Portfolio suitability would need more active trading Average to below average liquidity Index is new Issue is new and needs seasoning Fees are high Portfolio suitability also needs seasoning Liquidity below average This sector overall responds to perceived and real economic conditions. Should investors sense an economic slowdown demand for base commodities will decline and so too will associated stocks. Conversely, should investors believe an economic expansion is underway then products and stocks should rally. Uniquely, the level of the U.S. dollar is also another important determinant as to price action given commodities overall are priced in dollars. A strong dollar in the current environment should mean a decline in commodity prices and vice versa. It’s important to remember also when the overall stock market declines so too may this sector even if commodity prices are rising. It’s also important to remember that ETF sponsors have their own competitive business interests when issuing products which may not necessarily align with your investment needs. New ETFs from highly regarded and substantial new providers are also being issued. These may include Charles Schwab’s ETFs and Scottrade’s Focus Shares which both are issuing new ETFs with low expense ratios and commission free trading at their respective firms. These may also become popular as they become seasoned.

2012-07-19,July 18th Technical Analysis Perspective,"A diamond pattern has formed in the Dow Jones Industrials. The question of the day is whether it is a consolidation pattern or a topping pattern? Its natural habitat is near tops. However, the volume the past 2 trading days has been slightly above average. Wednesday's price action did pierce thru the 100 day moving average, its final moving average to conquer to the upside. To the technicians eye, this appears to be a breakout from a “consolidation” diamond pattern. However, I recommend a few confirmation days to be certain this price action stays moving higher, not lower like a typical diamond top pattern produces. Allow me to throw a wrench in the spokes of the bull's bicycle!! The above chart is a Dow Theory non-confirmation signal. What this means is as the Dow Industrials (bottom chart) made a higher high in early July, the Dow Transports (top chart) did not!! The refusal of one Average to confirm the other can never produce a positive signal of any sort. It has only negative connotations. Those are the words of the inventor, Mr. Charles Dow, not mine. Divergences, like this one, most often occur at reversals in the Major Trend. Couple this signal with the possible Diamond Top in the Industrials and you can quickly pick up that I am not so bullish on the equity markets right now. I follow the charts, not my heart!!! A longer term look at the S&P 500 shows major resistance being challenged currently. 1370.58 was the high made back on May 1st 2011and is acting as an area where sellers emerge. We closed at 1372 today. Let's see if those prices can hold. This will be the 4th time challenging this supply line at 1370. There are 3 important characteristics to look for in trendlines. 1) The more times a trendline is touched without penetration, the greater its significance (strength). 2) The longer a trendline holds without penetration, the greater the significance. 3) The flatter a trendline is, the more important it is technically. For those of you who have followed my work this year, you now know why I have marked my top end of the S&P's trading range at 1370. Everyone I have talked to has overlooked this trendline and nobody has said anything about it on the major business networks. My secret has just been unveiled! That high produced back in 2011(1370) now has major significance if it's 1) broken to the upside on elevated volume OR 2) prices stop at this level and retreat. It is a major turning point for the S&P 500. Today produced a reading of 1372. One day doesn't make a trend, so I would caution anyone in jumping in on the long side of the market Thursday without waiting for at least 2 confirmation days to validate this potential breakout. Now take your attention off the blue trendline and focus in on the 2 angled red trendlines. This formation is called a Flag. In this instance, it's a rising flag. These usually mark a continuation of the preceding trend, in this case, down. It's a pattern that signifies investors digesting the strong move down from the top, 1422. If we hit our head on the 1370 mark and retrace lower, watch for the bottom red trendline to hold and act as near term support. That number is 1340-1350. If this trendline is broken to the downside, the flag has been completed and further price depreciation should be expected. The chart would appear to find buyers near the 1310 level, its June low and the 200 day moving average. One final pattern here! Use the top blue horizontal line and couple it with the upward sloping, bottom red line used in your rising flag construction. This pattern is called an ascending triangle and has bullish tendencies. Wait for a break above 1370 on high volume to complete the pattern. A price target produced from this pattern yields the S&P at 1472 in the future. Another reason I am not bullish on these equity markets right now. The top chart is the VIX and is approaching support near the $14.50 - $15 level. When the VIX finds support, equity markets typically struggle. Since the VIX is at major long term support and the S&P at major long term resistance, I believe the VIX will win this arm wrestling contest. An updated look at the weekly number of new highs for the NYSE. The bottom line marks the number of weekly new highs. As you can see as we approach the 2000 level, markets typically stall and retreat. Today's reading stands at 1359 and increasing. I posted this critical chart on Twitter last night. One more very important reason why I think the equity markets will eventually have to move lower soon. The bottom chart is the 10 yr. yield. It keeps going down, meaning bond prices are going up, while the equity markets keep moving UP as well! This is called a negative divergence in technical analysis. This is unsustainable if our markets are perceived “healthy”. Why are bond prices AND the stock market going up in tandem? I think the bond vigilantes don't believe the economy is in as good as shape as the equity markets think it is. Time will tell. GDX broke down under minor support last week. Prices seem to have followed through and appear to want to move lower. RSI is in bear territory, money flow has just turned negative, but the stochastic is oversold. The stochastic can stay oversold for an extended period of time while prices continue to move lower. Look at the time frame from March 5th to April 23rd. A move below $39 is bearish for this issue. GDXJ, the Junior Miners, has a similar chart. Silver appears to be in more of dire straits than its counterpart gold. What is interesting about this chart is as SLV bumps down along support of $26, its overbought/oversold indicator has a neutral reading. Typically when an investment is on its support level, the overbought/oversold indicator is almost always on an oversold reading. This is not the case and could bring significantly lower prices if SLV breaks down below $26. If SLV breaks down, GLD will more than likely follow soon after. Technical Strategy going forward: Earnings report have been just ok thus far, my opinion. A bigger portion of the companies reporting have beat already lowered numbers, a fact. The pattern for this earnings season seems to be companies beating on the bottom line (earnings per share), but missing on the top line (revenue). This blinks sales slowdown paired with cost cutting to achieve earnings prowess. Markets keep powering higher however, lead by the Utilities and Healthcare. Technology had a good day, but has been lagging recently. Apple was down today in a good tape. Bond prices across the curve continued their ascent higher! XLU broke to a new annual high. The Dow Theory still has a non-confirmation reading and the Industrials have a Diamond formation lingering. Bond prices continue to go up. None of the bull market sectors are showing signs of life. All these items still make me take a cautious, non trusting, stance with this market. Price action, option activity, and technical indicators give me the feeling that this is just a short covering rally, not one powered by quality earnings, increased investor demand for risk, and a healthy economy. I feel we are entering bull trap territory where 2nd quarter earnings, Capital Hill testimony, and QE3 “hopes” overshadow the true supply and demand picture of these markets. If these earnings keep rolling in mediocre to good, there will be no QE3 announcement on August 1st, no matter if the unemployment rate rises or falls in the interim, my opinion. There, I am out on a limb! Watch and see if this 1370 level holds for the S&P the next few days. 800 is your bogey for the Russell 2000, and 12,838 for the Dow Jones. As always, if you need charts marked up or a clarification on something, please reach out and ask. By: Mike Dalman, CMT Mike Dalman Investment Research"
2012-08-01,Knight Capital Glitch May Have Impacted Some ETFs,"Wall Street is abuzz today about technology issues at execution firm Knight Capital (NYSE: KCR) that impacted trading in roughly 140 New York Stock Exchange-listed equities. The affected stocks include Dow components Alcoa (NYSE: AA), Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ), among other marquee issues and the technology glitches are believed to have forced Knight to tell clients to route their trades to rival execution shops. Exchange traded funds, often criticized by naysayers as one cause of the 2010 flash crash, were also affected by the Knight Capital imbroglio. This morning, we watched volumes explode in a number of stocks and ETFs, said Chris Hempstead, head of institutional sales and trading at WallachBeth Capital. New York-based WallachBeth is one of the largest ETF execution firms in the U.S. In an interview with Benzinga, Hempstead highlighted several examples of ETFs that saw unusually large volume. One prominent example is the Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSE: VPU). VPU's volume for Wednesday was close to 6.6 million shares, significantly higher than three-month daily average of less than 73,400 shares. Hempstead said the abnormal activity in VPU prompted his team to look at the Utilities Select SPDR (NYSE: XLU), the largest utilities ETF. With about an hour left in the trading day, XLU's volume has already surpassed double the daily average. We flagged enormous flow into VPU, Hempstead said. As such we immediately looked to XLU for carry over flow. Indeed XLU was trading at abnormally high volume levels during the early part of today's session. There was also significant activity in the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest ETF tracking companies that extract the yellow metal from the earth. Hempstead said the action in GDX might be the result of a massive surge in volume in the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT). NUGT's volume has eclipsed five times its daily average. The issues experience by Knight Capital today underscore the notion that as technology plays an ever-growing role in the capital markets, situations like this will occur from time-to-time. These situations also shine a light on what execution firms are doing to take preventative action to the degree such action is possible. As a general rule of thumb, and a prudent one at that, we like to have multiple checks and balances built into our internal trading platform in order to prevent these unfortunate situations, Hempstead said. WallachBeth aggregates pricing from the a broad range of liquidity providers, ensuring the company is never dependent on any one single proprietary trading firm. Nobody likes to hear or read about any Industry peer that experiences operational problems, particularly when it impacts investors seeking access to the trading marketplace. Without knowing the particulars of the incident that captured industry news headlines this morning, this latest event serves as catalyst for those who debate the definition of best execution and the wisdom of relying on a single source when executing order, Hempstead said."
2012-08-08,S&P Capital IQ Bullish on Gold Miners,"It is not a secret that shares of gold miner ETFs have performed disappointingly relative to gold futures. And it is also not a secret that this scenario has played out for a long enough time period that calling a bottom in gold miners has been hazardous. However, the prevailing bull case for gold miners says signs of life will soon emerge. In a research note, S&P Capital IQ said it remains positive on gold's outlook for this year and 2013. S&P Capital IQ provided a number of reasons for its bullish outlook on the yellow metal. First, given that the Federal Reserve is committed to keeping short-term interest rates at near zero through 2014, we see no opportunity cost for buying and holding gold anytime soon, S&P said in the note. Second, despite higher gold prices, global mine production has been stagnant for over a decade. According to data compiled by Gold Fields Minerals Service, a U.K.-based metals consulting firm and publisher, global mine output in 2011 totaled 2,809 tons, up eight percent from 2,602 tons in 1999. We believe production will remain stagnant for the next several years, as old mines are becoming depleted and are not being replaced to the extent needed to significantly lift output. S&P also cited volatility among major global currencies and elevated concerns over solvency of international sovereign debt. The research provider added, In our view, the threat of debt defaults increases the appeal of gold as a safe haven asset. In addition, rising money supply in the U.S. could be a catalyst to drive gold higher this year, according to S&P. In terms of individual gold miners, S&P has a five-star rating on Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and four-star ratings on Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) and Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD). Those three stocks combine for about 30 percent of Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). With almost $8.1 billion in assets under management, GDX is the largest ETF tracking gold mining equities. GDX has struggled this year, falling almost 15 percent even as ETFs backed by physical gold have risen. The SPDR Gold shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), the two largest gold ETFs, each rose about three percent year-to-date. Small-cap gold miners have performed even worse than their large-cap counterparts year-to-date. During this period, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) has fallen almost 20 percent. Unlike some of its peers, GDXJ has some mid-cap exposure and allocations to silver miners. The fund has nearly $2.3 billion in AUM. S&P did not include ratings for either gold miner ETF in the research note. For more on mining ETFs, click here."
2012-08-23,A Look at How Top Hedge Funds Are Positioned in Gold,"The gold trade has always been controversial. Obviously, gold investors have done extremely well over the last decade, but many financial types still scoff at holding a large precious metals position. While gold bugs receive frequent derision, the reality is that many of the savviest money managers in the world are, in fact, gold bugs. Hedge funds recently filed their second quarter 13-Fs outlining their long equity positions, and this allows us to see how some of the top funds are positioned in gold. The 13-F filings, however, do not cover holdings of physical gold, so while they are not a full accounting, they do provide a glimpse into who is still involved in the precious metals trade. Greenlight Capital - This hedge fund is run by noted short-seller and value investor David Einhorn, who happens to be a big fan of gold. In fact, Greenlight actually has a gold-denominated fund. In 2009, Einhorn sold his position in the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) and bought physical gold instead. The word is that Greenlight stores its physical gold at an undisclosed vault located in Manhattan. Rest assured, there is a lot of gold in that vault -- hundreds of millions of dollars worth. In addition to Greenlight's position in physical gold, the hedge fund also reported positions in Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and the Market Vectors Gold Mining Trust ETF (NYSE::GDX). Greenlight's position in Barrick amounted to around $73 million as of the fund's last filing. The Gold Miners ETF position was worth a whopping $269 million. Based on what we know about David Einhorn and how his fund is positioned, it is clear that he still likes gold as an investment. Paulson & Co. - Similar to Greenlight Capital, John Paulson's hedge fund also offers a gold-denominated fund. Paulson is probably the best-known gold bug in the world at this point. Paulson & Co.'s most recent 13-F is full of gold miners and the hedge fund is still holding a giant position in the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD). The first company that shows up in the filing is Agnico-Eagle Mines (NYSE: AEM), a Canadian gold miner. The hedge fund's position in Agnico-Eagle was valued at just over $41 million. Paulson also has a nearly $43 million position in less well-known miner Allied Nevada Gold (NYSE: ANV). Paulson & Co.'s 13-F also shows that the fund continues to hold a very large position in South African gold miner AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE: AU). In fact, the fund is the largest holder of the company, with a 8.50% stake valued at roughly $1.13 billion. Now, that is a position! Next up, is Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX). Paulson has a $34 million stake in this well-known gold miner. The filing also shows a $231 million position in Gold Fields Limited (NYSE: GFI). Given the sheer number of gold miners that show up in Paulson & Co's filing, it is clear that the billionaire is covering all of the bases to make sure his investors do well if gold continues to rise like he expects. Paulson has a $45 million position in IAMGOLD Corp. (NYSE: IAG) and a new $189 million stake in NovaGold Resources (NYSE: NG). The hedge fund also owns nearly $84 million worth of Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD). Finally, there is, Paulson & Co.'s massive stake in the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD). This position was valued at a whopping $3.39 billion as of the last filing period. Given the size and scope of Paulson's gold holdings, there is little doubt that he and his investors have as much riding on the yellow metal as anyone in the world. Soros Fund Management - George Soros is an interesting guy. He is a diehard liberal, but also an uber-capitalist. Even at 82, George Soros might be the best trader on the planet. He didn't make his money like Warren Buffett, who is a buy and hold guy, but rather by moving in and out of markets with gigantic size. In recent years, Soros has been trading the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD). This makes sense, as it is one of the most liquid securities on Earth and is big enough to accommodate the size he trades. As of Soros Fund Management's last 13-F filing, he was riding a roughly $137 million position in the ETF. Soros also owns the two prominent gold mining ETFs. His fund had a $45 million and $46 million stake in the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). He also owned a very small position in Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), which was valued at a little over $6 million. While Soros is not nearly as invested in gold as Einhorn and Paulson, it is also hard to gauge exactly what he is doing from his 13-F filing because he is known to move in and out of positions with fairly high frequency."
2012-08-28,"ETFs to Watch August 28, 2012 (GDX, EWY, JNK)","Here is the ETF Professor's ETF Watch List for Tuesday August 28, 2012. The U.S. Natural Gas Fund (NYSE: UNG) will almost certainly be in play. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is trying to make things interesting. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) is still flirting with a 52-week high. Emerging markets plays of the day: ProShares UltraShort FTSE China 25 (NYSE: FXP), ProShares UltraShort MSCI Emerging Markets (NYSE: EEV) and the iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund (NYSE: EWY). Forex play of the day: CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust (NYSE: FXC). Bond play of the day: SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE: JNK)."
2012-08-28,3 Precious Metals ETFs Your Broker Forgot to Mention,"With $68.9 billion in assets under management, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) is the second-largest ETF in the world. The iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) is not exactly tiny with $10 billion in AUM, nor can the $9.5 billion iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) be considered diminutive. On the mining front, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has almost $8.4 billion in AUM while the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is home to a healthy $2.6 billion in assets. In other words, it is unusual to find an exchange-traded product that offers exposure to the precious metals complex that can be considered anonymous or obscure. Whether its a futures play, a fund backed by physical holdings or an equity-based fund, there are a few precious metals ETFs and ETNs out there that brokers and investors probably have not heard of. With gold and silver looking as though they want to make new highs, there is no time like the present to become acquainted with some new precious metals plays. ETFS Physical White Metals Basket Shares (NYSE: WITE) For the investor that already has gold exposure and just cannot decide between the white metals, there is the ETFS Physical White Metals Basket Shares. Nearly two-years-old, WITE uses a basket approach to give investors exposure to silver, platinum and palladium. WITE currently holds almost 49,500 ounces of silver, 495 ounces of platinum and 396 ounces of palladium, according to ETF Securities data. Despite the soaring popularity of precious metals ETFs in recent years, WITE has struggled to capture investors' attention. The fund has just over $34 million in AUM and average daily volume below 1,900 shares. That shows investors are missing out on a good thing as WITE is up nine percent year-to-date. PowerShares DB Precious Metals Fund (NYSE: DBP) With almost $323 million in AUM, calling the PowerShares DB Precious Metals Fund anonymous is a stretch. Overlooked might be the more appropriate descriptor. Where DBP differs from funds such as GLD and SLV is its fees. DBP charges 0.79 percent per year, which is high among metals funds, particularly when considering DBP has no storage costs. Then again, futures-based exchange-traded products have a reputation for high fees and DBP does live up to that billing. The fund tracks the DBIQ Optimum Yield Precious Metals Index, which is 80 percent allocated to gold and 20 percent allocated to silver. DBP is up 6.3 percent year-to-date, but that is barely better than GLD and more than 400 basis points worse than SLV. iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund (NYSE: RING) The iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund is another good example of a new ETF that has shown it will be around for a while, though it is debatable that many investors even know that much about this mining play. RING debuted in late January and now has $32.4 million in AUM. That is not a bad haul, but that total also indicates RING has its hands full in terms of competing with GDX's first-to-market advantage. GDX and RING actually make for an interesting competition. RING's 0.39 percent expense ratio is 13 basis points below GDX's, but the Market Vectors fund has sharply outperformed the iShares ETF over the past three months. At the very least, RING is off to a better start than the iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP). SLVP has made almost no inroads on the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL), the dominant silver miners fund. For more on mining ETFs, click here."
2012-09-20,Some Low AUM ETFs Thriving In September,"The continued growth of the exchange-traded products industry has shined a light on the fact this business, while booming, is far from perfect. Notably, analysts, experts and pundits this year have increased scrutiny of those ETFs that are deemed to be too small as measured by assets under management. Typically, $100 million is the number thrown around as the AUM level at which an ETF becomes profitable for its sponsor. The $100 million level is also viewed as the point at which investors do not have to worry about the ETF being closed. What is often lost in this conversation is that profitability for the ETF sponsor and the fund's investors are two entirely different animals. That is to say ignoring low asset ETFs can prove costly and the data prove as much. Through June ten of the top-30 ETFs in terms of year-to-date performance had less than $50 million in AUM. The trend has continued this month as scores of low AUM funds have delivered stellar returns to investors. Market Vectors Egypt Index ETF (NYSE: EGPT) The Market Vectors Egypt Index ETF is one of the case studies for the price investors pay investors pay for ignoring small ETFs. With $61.4 million in AUM as of September 19, EGPT would be considered small by many experts and in danger of closing by some. What is not being acknowledged is that EGPT's AUM total has surged by about 20 percent since the end of August. More importantly, the ETF has shrugged off myriad negative headlines pertaining to the Middle East, including those about protests in Cairo, to jump 10.2 this month. Many of those up days have been realized on extraordinary volume, too. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG) In a crowded field dominated by the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) it is easy for rival funds to go unnoticed. That is the case with the Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF. GGGG debuted in March 2011 and has less than $5.1 million in AUM. With gold miners finally outperforming the yellow metal which they mine, GGGG is an ETF that should not be ignored. A 15.6 percent gain since the start of this month proves as much. Market Vectors Indonesia Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: IDXJ) To this point, there have been more reasons to avoid than embrace the newly-minted Market Vectors Indonesia Small-Cap ETF. Chief among them being the fact that IDXJ has lagged the performance of the Market Vectors Indonesia ETF (NYSE: IDX) over the past few months. Easily defined bull and bear cases exist for IDXJ, but there is no avoiding the fact that IDXJ is enjoying a solid September. With just $2.4 million in AUM, the ETF is up 7.6 percent this month, outperforming IDX by more than 220 basis points in the process. PowerShares S&P International Developed High Beta Portfolio (NYSE: IDHB) Naysayers could say the PowerShares S&P International Developed High Beta Portfolio's September performance is no big deal because the ETF is doing what it is supposed to do and that is outperform when the broader market is moving higher. On the other hand, an ETF accomplishing its stated objectives is important because some funds advertise one objective and get nowhere near delivering on that promise. Bottom line: IDHB does what it is supposed to do. High beta ETFs have not yet had many days in the sun compared to low beta and low volatility products. However, if European equities continue to rebound, IDHB will extend its gains. As it is, the fund is up 7.8 percent this month even though it has just $2.3 million in AUM.

2012-09-24,A Look Ahead: This Week's ETFs to Watch,"With enthusiasm for the third round of quantitative easing fading fast, stocks face significant hurdles in the week ahead as earnings and economic data points will take center stage. Earnings season is not yet in full bloom, but it is getting close and several marquee names have already delivered results. This week's economic calendar is heavy as traders will be treated to the final second-quarter GDP reading from the Commerce Department, durable goods orders, personal spending and income data and new home sales data. All of those data points have market-moving potential and some should impact the following ETFs. iShares Dow Jones US Home Construction Index Fund (NYSE: ITB) Or the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE: XHB). Both funds have posted runs that make each look like a growth, not a sector fund devoted to home builders and stocks like Home Depot (NYSE: HD). In the past month, ITB is up almost 15 percent. XHB is the laggard: with a gain of just 11.4 percent. Obviously useful plays on housing data releases, these two ETFs are also excellent gauges of risk appetite in the broader market. Naysayers will say ITB has more than doubled in the past year, questioning how much gas the ETF has left in its tank. WisdomTree India Earnings ETF (NYSE: EPI) Or just about any ETF for that matter. India spent much of the second quarter as the problem child of the BRICS group and that is saying something since the quintet was unimpressive as a whole. Now, Asia's third-largest economy is showing signs of life, igniting significant rallies in EPI and rival funds along the way. In an other effort to further open its market to foreign investment, the Indian government said Saturday it will cut taxes on interest earned by overseas holders of Indian bonds and also formalized a plan to reduce capital gains taxes on equities, Forbes reported. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) The big story on the gold front is not the bullish action in the yellow metal. Rather, it is the fact that the miners are finally getting in on the act. Actually, the miners and ETFs such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF are outperforming bullion and ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD). Like the home builder ETFs, funds such as GDX have rallied hard and fast in a condensed period, making the question how much gas is left in the tank a relevant one. Remember this about GDX: Yes, the ETF is up more than 15 percent in the past month. However, it is only higher by 6.6 year-to-date and still in the red over the past year."
2012-09-24,Some New ETFs Already Impressing,"There are some undeniable truths about the state of the exchange-traded products industry. Assets are expected to rise in 2012 and in the coming years, but on the downside fund closures are on the uptick, too. Despite a turbulent market environment and intensifying competition, ETF sponsors continue to issue new products at a solid clip and recent filing data indicate pipelines for future introductions are robust. It is the debut of plans and for new ETFs and ETNs that shines a light on another undeniable truth: Not all new ETPs will succeed, but some will. In fact, a fair amount of funds that have debuted in 2012 are off to solid starts and that does not include the $2.7 billion PIMCO Total Return ETF (NYSE: BOND). Not surprisingly, the Bill Gross ETF is in a league of its own when it comes to successful new ETFs. A recent Barron's piece highlighted several new funds that are prospering. We will look at some of those ETFs as well as add to the list right here: iShares MSCI Global Select Metals & Mining Producers Fund (NYSE: PICK) In an already crowded field for materials ETFs, PICK has thrived, as Barron's noted. The fund has hauled in more than $221 million in AUM since its February debut. While PICK has clearly been a success, another pair of new iShares mining funds have seen mixed AUM performances. The iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund (NYSE: RING) and the iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP) have notched stellar gains in recent weeks as gold and silver miners have surged, but the funds have just $41.4 million and $2.4 million in AUM, respectively. In the case of RING, that is not too bad for an ETF that debuted in February. However, both RING and SLVP prove it is tough to go up against well-established competitors such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL). Market Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (NYSE: PFXF) Van Eck, parent company of Market Vectors, looks like it has struck gold with PFXF to this point. It is not surprising because PFXF has multiple selling points. For starters, are craving yield and PFXF features a 30-day SEC yield of 6.21 percent. Second, PFXF is truly unique in that it is the only ETF tracking preferred stocks that does not feature an absurd weight to financial services names. REITs account for a third of the fund's weight, but that is nothing compared to the 80 percent or higher allocation given to bank stocks by other preferred stock ETFs. Next, PFXF's expense ratio of 0.4 percent makes it the cheapest preferred stock ETF on the market. Add all that up, and it is not surprising that the ETF has $67.3 million in AUM in just three months of trading. iShares MSCI Frontier 100 Index Fund (NYSE: FM) It might not be fair to include the iShares MSCI Frontier 100 Index Fund on this list because the fund is just starting its second full week of trading. That said, the newest entrant to the frontier market ETF competition is off to a banner start with almost $13 million in assets under management. FM's debut was widely anticipated in some corners of the ETF industry and despite the elevated risk involved with frontier markets compared to emerging economies, FM has thus far lived up to the hype. Some might say it is too early to hop on the FM bandwagon and what could prove integral to the fund's success going forward is its ability to provide some form of decent liquidity in markets with a reputation for being illiquid. FM's fact sheet indicates measures are in place to bolster liquidity and if the fund makes good on that, it could be one of the more popular new products of 2012. SPDR Barclays Capital Short Term High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE: SJNK) The SPDR Barclays Capital Short Term High Yield Bond ETF is an interesting case. One cannot look at this ETF and gloss over a modified adjusted duration of just over two years, meaning the fund is more exposed to changes in interest rates than its longer duration counterparts. Additionally, SJNK is completely overshadowed in junk bond ETF conversation by the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond Fund (NYSE: HYG) and the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE: JNK). Perhaps overshadowed is too harsh an assessment. SJNK has accumulated almost $289 million in AUM since its mid-March debut. That puts the fund in position to be one of this year's most successful new ETFs of any kind and probably no worse than the second-best new bond ETF in terms of AUM behind the PIMCO Total Return ETF.

2012-09-25,These ETFs Have Topped Tech's Big 3,"The Nasdaq trio of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) have been, to put it delicately, impressive over the past three months. Amid new product introductions and favorable sentiment toward the technology sector, these names have buttressed their status as growth darlings. In the past three months, Amazon has jumped 17 percent, which trails the 20.8 percent Apple has gained over the same time. Both pale in comparison to Google, which surged almost 36.2 percent since late July. Investors that bought any of the three in July are probably quite happy. Those with the capital to have invested in all three are sitting on an average three-month gain of 24.6 percent. Said another way, owning the trio of Amazon, Apple and Google for the past three months delivered returns that are 50 percent better than what the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) has done in all of 2012. Yes, it is hard to find ETFs that have outperformed the average gain of the aforementioned tech trio over the past 90 days. Hard, but not impossible. Take a look at the following funds: Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) The small-cap cousin to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), itself recently an impressive performer, has simply been on fire. GDXJ is on pace for a 30 percent third-quarter gain. Even if it stayed in neutral until the end of the quarter, the ETF will end up having outpaced Amazon and Apple by healthy margins. The mining ETFs have finally stopped frustrating investors and are outpacing ETFs backed by physical gold such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), as ETF Trends notes. To its credit, GDX has slightly outperformed Amazon in the past three months as well. Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) For as good as the gold miners have been in the past 90 days, the silver miners are having a say in the matter as well. In that time, the Global X Silver Miners ETF, by far the largest of the two silver miners ETFs, has jumped 31.2 percent. That run easily trumps the returns offered by Amazon and Apple over the same time and it also beats the average of Amazon, Apple and Google. The rival iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP) has been stout as well, surging nearly 29 percent. Market Vectors Egypt ETF (NYSE: EGPT) Simply put, the Market Vectors Egypt ETF has been on a torrid pace this year. It is one of the best-performing country-specifc ETFs tracking any type of market, developed, emerging or frontier. What makes EGPT's performance all the more noteworthy is that the ETF is soaring in the face of Middle East headlines that cannot be considered favorable. A case can be made that EGPT is overbought at current levels. Then again, some might argue the ETF still has some upside ahead because it still trades well below where resided before the onset of the 2011 Arab Spring. In the past three months, EGPT is up a Google-esque 35 percent, which is to say a tiny ETF tracking one of the most politically volatile countries in the world and a frontier market at that has been twice as good as Amazon over the same and almost 1,500 basis points better than Apple.

2012-10-16,Rand's Wild Ride Plaguing Mining ETFs,"Amid labor strife at South Africa's gold, diamond, palladium and platinum mines, the country's rand currency has been plunging. Standard & Poor's paring South Africa's credit rating by one notch to BBB with a negative outlook last week did not help matters for the commodity currency. Over the past month, the rand has been one of the worst-performing of the so-called exotic currencies. The WisdomTree Dreyfus South African Rand Fund (NYSE: SZR) is off about 5.1 percent since September 17. The faltering rand is not just bad news for SZR. Rand woes have plagued previously resurgent precious metals mining ETFs. The iShares MSCI South Africa Index Fund (NYSE: EZA) has outperformed the currency fund by about 200 basis points over the past month, but EZA is not a pure materials/mining play. While those sectors are vital to South Africa's economic output, this Africa's largest economy. To that end, EZA offers some level of sector diversity as financials account for 25.5 percent of the fund's weight. At 18.4 percent, materials names barely outpace the allocation given to consumer discretionary issues. Pure mining ETFs have not been so lucky during South Africa's labor woes. As Index Universe astutely points out, mining ETFs with significant weights to South Africa have been decked by the rand's demise. The Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF with almost $9.7 billion in assets under management, features an allocation of 11.2 percent to South Africa. That fund has lost 2.4 percent in the past month. The new iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund (NYSE: RING) devotes nearly 10 percent of its country weight to South Africa and that ETF has slipped 4.7 percent in the past 30 days. Should South African labor strife continue and show no signs of abating, currency traders will be all the more inclined to punish the rand. That proposition does not bode well for the likes of GDX and RING, but those are not the only ETFs under pressure by way of the faltering rand. The Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG) features a 14.6 weight to South Africa. As a result, that ETF has slid almost three percent in the past month. However, neither GDX, GGGG nor RING are the most victimized ETFs due to the rand's decline. SZR, the ETF that tracks the currency, is not, either. For all the talk about the rand's impact on shares of gold miners and the corresponding ETFs, it cannot be forgotten that South Africa is the world's largest platinum producer and the second-largest producer of palladium behind Russia. To that end, it probably is not surprising that the First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (NASDAQ: PLTM) has plunged 14.7 percent in the past 30 days. PLTM focuses on companies that mine metals from the platinum group, which includes platinum, palladium, osmium, iridium, ruthenium and rhodium. These firms are often smaller by market value and feature higher betas than gold miners. The median market cap of PLTM's holdings is just $365 million, but the fund has a weight of 38.4 percent to South Africa. Those two factors are enough to make PLTM vulnerable to ongoing negative headlines from South Africa. For more on South Africa and ETFs, click here."

2012-11-08,These QE3 ETF Plays Have Proven Durable,"On September 13, the Federal Reserve announced it would engage in additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities while pledging to keep interest rates low through at least mid-2015. That amounted to the third round of quantitative easing so many traders and investors were dying to hear about and a market rally was ignited in the process. Now, nearly two months since the Fed unveiled QE3, many of the most obvious ETF beneficiaries of the program have given up their gains. ETFs ranging from equity-based energy funds to those tracking mortgage agencies have tumbled, leading investors to wonder if QE3 will have any positive impact at all. Not all is lost as the following QE3 ETF plays have held up quite nicely following the announcement. Perhaps that is a sign of more gains to come. iShares MSCI All Peru Capped Index Fund (NYSE: EPU) The lone ETF exclusively devoted to Peru was anointed an ideal QE3 play because Peru is a major producer of gold and silver. Monetary easing debases currencies, in this case the dollar, and gold is denominated in dollars. The prediction about EPU being a valid QE3 ETF proved accurate as the fund rallied in the days leading up to September 13 and on the announcement itself. EPU would take a peak over $45 following the QE3 news and while it is slightly below that level today, the fund has held onto the bulk of its QE3-induced gains. Now, EPU looks like a credible play with which to avoid the post-election fallout in the U.S.. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY) One of the desired intents of quantitative easing is to spur economic activity and to get consumers feeling good about the economy. That means XLY and other discretionary ETFs were bid up leading up to and following the announcement. To be fair, XLY is trading lower today than where it was on September 13. However, the fund has held up better than other obvious QE3 sector plays such as oil ETFs and XLY has found support at $46. Risk takers can buy XLY at current levels and reap the rewards of a potentially robust holiday shopping season. Averting the fiscal cliff will also be a positive catalyst for XLY and its rivals. Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) Any of the equity-based mining ETFs would have been included on a list of QE3 winners and SIL is no exception. With a beta over 2.2, market-moving monetary stimulus is like a dream come true for an ETF such as this one. The downside of SIL's high beta ways is that the fund is highly volatile and vulnerable to waning enthusiasm for programs such as QE3. Well, it should be noted SIL trades slightly lower today than where it resided immediately following the Fed's September 13 announcement. However, there is more to the story. Not only is SIL still within striking distance of its post-announcement highs, since September 13 the ETF has sharply outperformed the following QE3 winners: The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP).

2012-11-15,"Soros Adds to Gold Miner ETF Positions, Raises GLD Stake","Billionaire investor George Soros, who as recently as late 2011 said gold was an asset bubble, now appears quite bullish on the yellow metal and the companies that extract it from the earth. During the third quarter, Soros Fund Management LLC added to its investment in the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the second-largest ETF in the world by assets. The firm raised its interest in GLD to 1.3 million shares from 884,400 shares, according to an SEC filing. Even at 1.3 million shares. Soros Fund Management owns a small percentage of GLD's shares outstanding, which stood at 443.2 million as of November 14. The filing also indicates Soros Fund Management has boosted its holdings of ETFs that own shares of gold miners. An August SEC filing showed the firm held 1 million shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and nearly 2.4 million shares of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). The November filing indicates Soros has more than doubled his GDX stake to 2.32 million shares and now holds a sizable chunk of call options on the ETF as well. The firm's position in GDXJ has not changed, according to the filing. Since mid-August, GLD has jumped 6.6 percent while GDXJ has soared 5.7 percent. GDX has risen 3.3 percent over the same time. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) combine for a third of GDX's weight. Soros also slightly added to his position in the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). The firm owned 350,000 shares of XME as of the August filing, but the more recent November filing indicates that stake has risen to 353,400 shares and the firm also owns call options on that ETF. XME does hold some gold miners, but the fund is heavily allocated to coal and steel names such as Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE). Soros also holds a stake in the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) as well as call options on that position. Other ETFs that Soros Fund Management holds interests in according to the November filing include the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP), the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE: KBE) and the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). The firm also owns options on the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM) and the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI). EEM is the second-largest emerging markets ETF by assets while FXI is the largest China fund. For more on ETFs, click here."

2012-11-28,South Africa ETF: Less Bad Than Gold Miners Fund,"As the fourth-largest producer of gold in the world, the fortunes of the South African economy are often viewed as hitched to the performance of the yellow metal itself. When it comes to ETFs, the correlations between gold and South African equities are not always as intimate as some investors think. For example, in the past month, the iShares MSCI South Africa Index Fund (NYSE: EZA) has slumped 0.7 percent while the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) is higher by 0.2 percent. That indicates that EZA does not always move in lockstep with gold futures. Nor is EZA a lock to respond favorably when production of gold, platinum and palladium declines. That much was affirmed earlier this year when, even though platinum and palladium futures surged amid labor unrest in South Africa, EZA did not. South Africa is the world's largest platinum producer and the second-largest palladium producer behind Russia. One obvious reason for the EZA's recent turbulence is its exposure to mining equities. The ETF devotes 18 percent of its weight to the materials sector and several marquee gold and silver miners appear among the fund's top-10 holdings. Appearing among the top ten weightings in the fund are names including Anglogold Ashanti Limited, Impala Platinum Holdings, and Gold Fields Ltd. There are currently 52 individual equity names represented in the underlying basket of EZA, said Street One Financial Vice President Paul Weisbruch in a note published today. While the exposure to mining names has been a drag on EZA, it is worth noting the fund has sharply outperformed mining ETFs in the past month. Over that time, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) have plunged 7.46 percent and eight percent, respectively. Year-to-date, GDX is off nearly eight percent while EZA has jumped 6.2 percent. Still, EZA has lagged the broader emerging markets universe as measured by the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM). Year to date, EZA has lagged the broader MSCI Emerging Markets Index, up 5.46% versus the benchmark rallying 8.03% during the same time period. However, EZA has provided a relative safe haven in the context of Emerging Markets countries in the trailing five year period, as the ETF is down only 7.70% versus the MSCI Emerging Markets Index losing 16.48% during this time frame, said Weisbruch. With regards to EZA, there is an easily defined bull/bear case for the fund and South Africa at large. The country is Africa's largest economy and the continent is viewed by many foreign investors as the last great untapped investment frontier. For its part, EZA is diverse at the sector level as financials account for a larger percentage of the ETF's weight than do materials names. Consumer discretionary stocks are just behind materials in the pecking order and telecommunications names receive an allocation north of 13 percent. The bear case revolves around the adverse impact labor strife can have and has had on the rand, South Africa's currency. Last month, Standard & Poor's paring South Africa's credit rating by one notch to BBB with a negative outlook as labor tensions in South Africa. Speaking of labor woes, South Africa's unemployment rate of over 20 percent cannot be ignored, either. For more on South Africa, click here."
2012-11-30,Even The Pros Struggle With Gold Miners ETFs,"A frequent point of frustration for investors during gold's multi-year bull market has been the inability of mining stocks and ETFs to keep pace with bullion. The statistics highlight that frustration. Over the past five years, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is up just two percent while the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), which offers exposure to physical gold, has more than doubled. Over the past three years, GLD has jumped 45.3 percent while GDX is off 3.3 percent. Making the situation even worse is volatility. As in GDX's volatility over the past three years 32.1 percent compared to 18 percent for GLD. Even some of the brightest minds on Wall Streets have struggled with positions in GDX and other mining ETFs. Take the examples of Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn and Soros Fund Management's George Soros. Simply put, these gentlemen did not attain legendary status in the financial community by being wrong very often. In pop culture parlance, Einhorn and Soros are like Charlie Sheen. They win...a lot. However, the disconnect between gold and gold miners can test even the savviest of investors. In third quarter of 2011, Greenlight pared its holdings of bullion and moved into GDX. At the time, Einhorn highlighted the aforementioned disconnect between gold and shares of the miners that extract the yellow metal from the earth, Bloomberg reported. Given the challenging macroeconomic environment, we intend, for the foreseeable future, to continue holding a significant position in gold, Bloombeg reported, citing a Greenlight filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Greenlight's most recent 13F filing shows the firm held about $315 million worth of GDX at the end of the third quarter. There is a fair chance the hedge fund is in the red on that position. In the third quarter 2011, the lowest closing price for GDX was just under $54 while the highest close was just under $66. Today, the ETF barely hovers above $47, indicating that holders of the ETF with a cost basis in the mid-$50s would have had to do some dollar-cost averaging in the second and third quarters of this year when the ETF slumped. This is not to say Greenlight is out of the money by $10 a share on GDX. However, it is also fair to say that the largest gold miners ETF has not been another Lehman Brothers or Green Mountain Coffee (NASDAQ: GMCR) for Einhorn. At least not yet. As for Soros, at least it can be said that he holds some shares of GLD. In fact, Soros Fund Management added 884,400 shares of the world's largest gold ETF during the third quarter to bring its stake in that ETF to 1.3 million shares at the end of the quarter. However, Soros also boosted his stake in GDX. At the end of August, Soros Fund Management owned 1 million shares of GDX. That total swelled to 2.32 million shares, according to the firm's most recent 13F. Again, it depends on when Soros was adding to GDX, but the ETF spent all of September and October trading above where it resides today. Beyond GDX, Soros has another potential problem in the form of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the small- and mid-cap equivalent to GDX. In the past year, GDXJ has plunged nearly 29 percent. Soros Fund Management owned 2.4 million shares of GDXJ at the end of the third quarter. Since the end of the second quarter of 2011, GDXJ has shed 35 percent of its value. Things have not been much better for the miners in recent weeks. GDXJ is off 8.3 percent in the past month while GDX has given up 7.8 percent over the same time. Smaller investors that, like Einhorn and Soros, see value in the miners can implement a hedge. After all, that is what hedge funds are supposed to do, right? That hedge, and it is one that should be used over short-term time frames, is the Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST). The aptly named DUST has jumped 19.4 percent in the past month. For more on ETFs, click here."

2012-12-19,8 Sector ETFs for 2013,"With the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) up 15.8 percent year-to-date, now is the time to drill down on what sectors have been driving the broader market's bullish ways and what industry groups have been laggards. It is possible that some old laggards will become new leaders while it is also possible that this year's outperformers will continue to deliver alpha next year. There is something else to note about sector ETFs. With bond, dividend and emerging markets ETFs among the leaders in terms of 2012 inflows, many sector funds are suddenly starved for attention. Take those ETFs that are not heavily exposed to major bank stocks or Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) out of the equation, and it is fair to say that, while not forgotten, some focus has shifted away from sector ETFs in recent months. That does not mean investors will face a dearth of opportunities at the sector level in 2013. Actually, the scenario is just the opposite and the following ETFs could be in focus throughout the new year. First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech Index Fund (NYSE: FBT) Barring an alarming reversal of fortune, the First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech Index Fund appears poised to end 2012 as the best-performing major biotech ETF. Assuming no significant change in the landscape, FBT could end the year with ahead of the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE: XBI) by over 600 basis points. However, past performance is no guarantee of future returns. That is worth noting, but it should be remembered that FBT, XBI and the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB) offer investors something many other sector funds do not: Immunity. Immunity from the trials and tribulations of Europe's debt crisis. Immunity from slowing emerging markets growth. And some immunity from domestic political wranglings. The question marks facing biotech ETFs heading into 2013 are what will the new drug approval environment look like and whether or not mergers and acquisitions will pick up. Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL) Forgive the puns, which are somewhat appropriate when discussing coal, but it would take a Christmas miracle for KOL to finish the year in the green. That is even with the benefit of an almost 9.5 percent gain in the past month. Year-to-date, KOL is off 21.1 percent, but the ETF and its constituents got some good news Tuesday when the International Energy Agency said coal will rival oil as the world's top fuel source by 2017. In other words, that means investing in a high-beta, low-dividend sector for the long-term, a proposition that is undoubtedly unappealing to conservative investors. Is increased coal demand a possibility? Yes. Can KOL perform better next year than it did this year? Well, it cannot do much worse. The other yes that needs to be factored into the equation is yes, natural gas prices are still low. The chart of the U.S. Natural Gas Fund (NYSE: UNG) says as much. That puts pressure on KOL's components to produce and sell more metallurgical coal for steel production in emerging markets. Translation: KOL can move higher if the Chinese and Indian economies support that move. iShares Dow Jones US Home Construction Index Fund (NYSE: ITB) One of 2012's shining starts among sector and sub-sector ETFs is the iShares Dow Jones US Home Construction Index Fund. ITB has surged 81.2 percent this year. That run has been buoyed by a steady stream of less bad/decent housing data, including this data point delivered Tuesday: The National Association of Home Builders said its NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index of home builder sentiment jumped to 47 this month from a revised 45 last month. Economists expected a December reading of 47. The December reading is the best since April 2006 During ITB's ascent, the battle cry of the unknowing has been the ETF is overbought. In reality, every decent dip the fund has endured this year has been a buying opportunity. ITB faces two tests in the new year. First, can the ETF keep moving higher even after an 81 percent gain? Second, the equity market is believed to be a forward-looking indicator. Theoretically, that means ITB has told investors the housing market could improve in earnest and do so soon. How the ETF responds to a truly bullish residential real estate market remains to be seen. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) Gold is poised to extend its annual winning streak to 12 consecutive years, but it is doubtful mining ETFs will get in on that act. In other words, barring a significant late-year turnaround, 2012 will be another year in which gold mining ETFs have proven vexing for investors even as gold has moved higher. Looking to 2013, there are some reasons why investors might find GDX and its components alluring. Decent valuations standout as one reason. The thesis, albeit flawed, that eventually the miners must start following gold higher is another. Neither is a truly compelling reason to be early to the gold miners. As Citigroup notes, diversified miners such as Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) are offering even better valuations than gold extractors. Amid rising costs and a rising reputation for frustration and being a group of laggards, gold miners have a lot to prove to investors before this group can be considered anything more than useful as a short-term trade. Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU) Or any U.S.-focused utilities ETF for that matter. There are nine select sector SPDRs ETFs and XLU has been the dog of that group in 2012 with a modest year-to-date loss. Many investors that are aware of the savage repudiation endured by XLU in recent weeks are pointing to fiscal cliff fears as a primary reason for the fund's doldrums. That is not an inaccurate assessment. Utilities are viewed as a dividend sectors and many dividend stocks and ETFs have been punished by fiscal cliff headlines. However, a case can be made that rich valuations have finally caught up with XLU and its holdings, a problem that was highlighted in June. Even after its recent tumble, XLU has a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.77, which is toward the higher end of the historical range for utilities stocks. To put that in perspective, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) has a P/E of 12.98. Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) A financial services ETF could not be left off this list, so the group's largest fund was included. Not only is XLF the largest ETF tracking bank stocks by assets, it has also topped its rivals in 2012. To XLF's credit, it has outpaced the Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSE: VFH) and the iShares Dow Jones US Financial Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYF), though all three have generated truly impressive returns. These ETFs have been helped by Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) almost doubling year-to-date and Citigroup (NYSE: C) surging more than 50 percent. In the case of XLF, those two stocks combine for almost 12 percent of the fund's weight. American International Group (NYSE: AIG), another XLF top-10 holding and another of the ETF's most controversial constituents, has soared 53 percent this year as well. In other words, in a sector laden with controversial names, XLF is benefiting from the performances of the most notorious financial services firms. Perhaps it will not be on a level that is comparable to what has been seen this year, but a 2013 sequel is possible, particularly if Bank of America does get approval from the Federal Reserve to pay a dividend and repurchase shares. First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (NYSE: TDIV) One might think the appearance of a new ETF on a list chock full of more established funds is odd, but the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund does merit consideration as one of the sector funds to consider for 2013 and the reasoning is quite simple. Not only is technology the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, the sector is now the fastest-growing in terms of dividends. Assume for a moment that the worst case scenario, that being the fiscal cliff, is avoided. Investors will again embrace dividend stocks and part of theme is finding stocks with potential for stellar dividend growth. Enter cash-rich technology companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and others. Give TDIV some credit. The ETF debuted in mid-August and has accumulated more than $47.6 million in assets. It has also sharply outperformed Apple over the past 90 days. That stock is not yet a TDIV holding, but it could be at a later date. FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index ETF (NYSE: GUNR) The FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index ETF is one ETF that critics of the exchange-traded products industry need to carefully examine because the fund dispels some of the common misnomers about the ETF industry. GUNR debuted in September 2011 and with more than $671 million in AUM today, the fund is clearly among the top ETFs to have debuted last year. Along those lines, GUNR is proof positive that new ETFs can be immediately successful and that successful new ETFs need not be issued by one of the three largest ETF sponsors. GUNR also proves that a new sector ETF can enter a crowded arena and provide value to investors. Indeed, there are plenty of energy ETFs on the market today, there are plenty of materials funds and there plenty of funds such as GUNR, which combine the two sectors. With a year-to-date gain of almost nine percent, GUNR has outpaced popular energy ETFs such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) and, at the very least, as performed in line with its energy/materials combination counterparts.

How the ETF responds to a truly bullish residential real estate market remains to be seen. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) Gold is poised to extend its annual winning streak to 12 consecutive years, but it is doubtful mining ETFs will get in on that act. In other words, barring a significant late-year turnaround, 2012 will be another year in which gold mining ETFs have proven vexing for investors even as gold has moved higher. Looking to 2013, there are some reasons why investors might find GDX and its components alluring. Decent valuations standout as one reason. The thesis, albeit flawed, that eventually the miners must start following gold higher is another. Neither is a truly compelling reason to be early to the gold miners. As Citigroup notes, diversified miners such as Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) are offering even better valuations than gold extractors. Amid rising costs and a rising reputation for frustration and being a group of laggards, gold miners have a lot to prove to investors before this group can be considered anything more than useful as a short-term trade. Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU) Or any U.S.-focused utilities ETF for that matter. There are nine select sector SPDRs ETFs and XLU has been the dog of that group in 2012 with a modest year-to-date loss. Many investors that are aware of the savage repudiation endured by XLU in recent weeks are pointing to fiscal cliff fears as a primary reason for the fund's doldrums. That is not an inaccurate assessment. Utilities are viewed as a dividend sectors and many dividend stocks and ETFs have been punished by fiscal cliff headlines. However, a case can be made that rich valuations have finally caught up with XLU and its holdings, a problem that was highlighted in June. Even after its recent tumble, XLU has a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.77, which is toward the higher end of the historical range for utilities stocks. To put that in perspective, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) has a P/E of 12.98. Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) A financial services ETF could not be left off this list, so the group's largest fund was included. Not only is XLF the largest ETF tracking bank stocks by assets, it has also topped its rivals in 2012. To XLF's credit, it has outpaced the Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSE: VFH) and the iShares Dow Jones US Financial Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYF), though all three have generated truly impressive returns. These ETFs have been helped by Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) almost doubling year-to-date and Citigroup (NYSE: C) surging more than 50 percent. In the case of XLF, those two stocks combine for almost 12 percent of the fund's weight. American International Group (NYSE: AIG), another XLF top-10 holding and another of the ETF's most controversial constituents, has soared 53 percent this year as well. In other words, in a sector laden with controversial names, XLF is benefiting from the performances of the most notorious financial services firms. Perhaps it will not be on a level that is comparable to what has been seen this year, but a 2013 sequel is possible, particularly if Bank of America does get approval from the Federal Reserve to pay a dividend and repurchase shares. First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (NYSE: TDIV) One might think the appearance of a new ETF on a list chock full of more established funds is odd, but the First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund does merit consideration as one of the sector funds to consider for 2013 and the reasoning is quite simple. Not only is technology the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, the sector is now the fastest-growing in terms of dividends. Assume for a moment that the worst case scenario, that being the fiscal cliff, is avoided. Investors will again embrace dividend stocks and part of theme is finding stocks with potential for stellar dividend growth. Enter cash-rich technology companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and others. Give TDIV some credit. The ETF debuted in mid-August and has accumulated more than $47.6 million in assets. It has also sharply outperformed Apple over the past 90 days. That stock is not yet a TDIV holding, but it could be at a later date. FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index ETF (NYSE: GUNR) The FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index ETF is one ETF that critics of the exchange-traded products industry need to carefully examine because the fund dispels some of the common misnomers about the ETF industry. GUNR debuted in September 2011 and with more than $671 million in AUM today, the fund is clearly among the top ETFs to have debuted last year. Along those lines, GUNR is proof positive that new ETFs can be immediately successful and that successful new ETFs need not be issued by one of the three largest ETF sponsors. GUNR also proves that a new sector ETF can enter a crowded arena and provide value to investors. Indeed, there are plenty of energy ETFs on the market today, there are plenty of materials funds and there plenty of funds such as GUNR, which combine the two sectors. With a year-to-date gain of almost nine percent, GUNR has outpaced popular energy ETFs such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) and, at the very least, as performed in line with its energy/materials combination counterparts.

2012-12-24,A Look Ahead: Next Week's ETFs to Watch,"This week will be short on trading time as the Christmas holiday means U.S. markets will be open just 3.5 days, but do not expect the week to be short on anxiety. Fiscal cliff anxiety that is. The market's favorite two-word buzz phrase is likely to have markets paralyzed throughout the week because U.S policymakers left for the holidays without any resolution. In fact, Congress will not reconvene until Thursday, December 27, meaning lawmakers have just five days left in which to avert the fiscal cliff. Under normal circumstances, it would be wise to be bullish this week. Stocks have strong seasonal tendencies to rise the days before and after Christmas. That is usually the case on the last trading day of the week after Christmas as well. However, seasonal trends can fly out the window when politicians get involved. Best case scenario is that Democrats and Republicans reach and agreement for a small deal designed to set the stage for more meaningful budget talks in 2013. With that in mind, these are a few of the ETFs to keep an eye this week. Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) Here is some very bad news for those that still believe gold mining stocks should be tracking gold futures on a more intimate basis. The iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) and the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) have both fallen below their 200-day moving averages. The problem with that scenario is that gold mining stocks and ETFs such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) do not track gold on the way up, but they do just that on the way down. For its part, GDX is 4.5 percent below its 200-day moving average. All of this works out to be very good news for DUST, which should continue to flourish as a short-term trading idea. iShares Silver Trust (NSYE: SLV) Keeping with the theme of plunging precious metals prices, there is the case of the iShares Silver Trust, an ETF that is off more than 10 percent in the past month. Worse yet, SLV plunged almost seven percent last week and that was during a week chock full of positive U.S. economic data points. Remember, the silver bulls say half of silver demand comes from industrial consumers. With a slow, holiday-shortened trading week on tap, calling for another seven percent drop in SLV is ambitious. However, the chart is a mess and that means the ProShares UltraShort Silver (NYSE: ZSL) is probably the better near-term silver play. SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE: KBE) The SPDR S&P Bank ETF and its bank ETF rivals were cruising toward strong finishes to 2012 when all of sudden, the fiscal cliff took charge. To be fair, bank stocks seem to be moving higher on any positive cliff news and falling on bad news. If nothing else, that means banks and ETFs such as KBE are somewhat predictable. Unbeknownst to some, KBE has a beta of 1.37, meaning it has a lower beta than the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) and the Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSE: VFH). KBE is also more of an equal-weight product with more exposure to smaller regional names than is found in larger financial services ETFs such as XLF and VFH. Those factors combine to tell investors two things. First, and the year-to-date returns support this, KBE can be somewhat of a laggard if large money-center banks are driving the financial services space higher. Second, a lower beta and a lower focus on the most controversial banking names implies KBE is one of the better ways to deal with the fiscal cliff noise while staying invested in the financial services sector.

2012-12-31,7 For '13: Leveraged ETFs For The New Year ,"With 2012 drawing to a close in a matter of hours, it is fair to say it has been another wild, volatile and perhaps disappointing year for leveraged ETFs. Wild and volatile because, and this is no surprise, some of the best-performing ETFs on a percentage basis this year are leveraged funds. Disappointing because many leveraged funds continue to confound investors that hold these products for extended time frames. For example, the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Financial Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYF), not a leveraged ETF, is up 22.6 percent this year. Presumably, that means the ProShares UltraShort Financials (NYSE: SKF), the double-leveraged inverse equivalent of IYF, is down 45.2 percent, right? Wrong. SKF is off just 42 percent, which may be a slight disappointment for those that had fortitude to short that product in January and ride that short all year. To be sure, that strategy should not be employed by all investors. However, use of leveraged ETFs as short-term trades , not long-term investments, will continue to work in 2013. Here are 10 such funds to consider in the new year. Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST) This list is no particular order, but if it was in order of preference, DUST might just appear in the top spot. The reason being is that gold mining stocks and ETFs continue to struggle relative to bullion. Making matters worse is the fact this is becoming a long-running theme. DUST proves the aforementioned point about the importance of not making leveraged ETFs investments. In 2012, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has lost 11.6 percent, but DUST is far worse with a loss of 21.3 percent. Do things the right way and view DUST as a short-term trade and one will see this ETF has surged eight percent in the past month while GDX has tumbled 9.6 percent. Bullish alternative: Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT). Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: FAS) The infamous FAS has surged 78.2 percent this year. An impressive run to be sure, but investors could have done a lot better by simply buying shares of Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) in January and holding that stake the entire year. Dow component BofA has more than doubled this year. Well, that is hindsight and investors are now wondering if FAS can offer a sequel to its 2012 heroics in 2013. It is possible. Financials are slightly cheaper than the broader market as the Financial Services Select SPDR (NYSE: XLF) has a P/E ratio below that of the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). A catalyst(s) for FAS could arrive in the first half of 2013 if regulators allow BofA and Citigroup (NYSE: C) to boost dividends and engage in much needed share repurchase programs. Bearish alternative: Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: FAZ). ProShares UltraShort Oil & Gas (NYSE: DUG) Here is another example of the dangers of holding a leveraged ETF over the course of a year. The index DUG is designed to deliver the two times the daily inverse performance of is the same index tracked by the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Energy Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYE). That ETF is up about 0.7 percent this year, but DUG has lost almost 15 percent. As is the case with DUST, there have been stretches of time where DUG has proven to be one of the better energy ETFs, though it is important to note those stretches do not last 10 or 12 months. Bottom line: Amid faltering production, integrated oil names could be in for another mediocre year in 2013, implying DUG is worth keeping an eye on. Bullish alternative: ProShares Ultra Oil & Gas (NYSE: DIG). Direxion Daily Technology 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: TECS) It is not hyperbole to say tons of market participants are concerned about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The largest U.S. company by market value traded over $700 in October, but appears destined to close the year below $530. Apple accounts for 17.2 percent of the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK), the ETF that tracks the same index TECS is designed to deliver three times the daily inverse performance of. When properly applied, TECS is useful either for those looking to profit from an Apple decline without having to incur the risks of shorting the stock directly or the limitations of the options market. Additionally, since TECS trades for less than $10, those that are long Apple or XLK, can use TECS as an occasional hedge. Bullish alternative: Direxion Daily Technology 3X Bull Shares (NYSE: TECL). ProShares UltraShort Yen (NYSE: YCS) Of all the ETFs mentioned on this list, YCS may come with the most simple, obvious reasoning. The yen will close 2012 as the worst-performing developed market currency. Newly elected Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to pressure the Bank of Japan to engage in unlimited monetary easing and target two percent inflation. At this juncture, it appears BoJ will acquiesce to Abe's demands. It is either that or risk losing its independence. Bullish alternative: ProShares Ultra Yen (NYSE: YCL). Direxion Daily Small Cap Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: TNA) Small-caps have held up quite well in an environment made challenging by politicians' inability to solve the fiscal cliff. The iShares Russell 2000 Index Fund (NYSE: IWM) has gained 1.7 percent in the past month compared to a loss 0.8 percent for the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). That could be a promising sign regarding the chances of a January Effect, the scenario under which small-caps leader a broader market rally to start the new year. If small-caps do become a leadership group in the first quarter, then the Direxion Daily Small Cap Bull 3X Shares becomes useful as a short-term trade. Bearish alternative: Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TZA). ProShares Ultra FTSE China 25 (NYSE: XPP)FXI). Year-to-date, over the past six months, 90 days and 30 days, XPP has offered just over double the returns of FXI. That should not change the fact that leveraged ETFs are not intended to be held all year. However, with Chinese equities and plain vanilla China ETFs closing 2012 in strong fashion, XPP merits consideration for the year ahead. Investors should note that XPP sharply outperformed the Direxion Daily China Bull 3X ETF (NYSE: YINN) in 2012. The two track different indexes and that likely explains the difference. Both funds are highly risky, but if one can grab better returns with a double-leveraged ETF over a similar triple-leveraged product, that is a deal that should be taken.

2013-01-10,Gold Miner ETFs Soar Despite Collapsed African Barrick Talks,"Shares of the $8.5 billion Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) are trading higher by more than two percent today despite news that a Chinese buyer is stepping away from talks to possibly acquire a controlling interest in African Barrick Gold. African Barrick is publicly traded unit of mining giant Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), GDX's largest constituent with a weight of 12.1 percent. Shares of Barrick are also higher by more than two percent despite news of the collapsed African Barrick talks. China National Gold Group and Barrick could not agree on a price for a 73.9 percent stake in African Barrick, the Wall Street Journal reported. Perhaps surprisingly, Barrick and GDX have fought off those headlines to move higher. Despite gold futures moving higher in 2012 for a twelfth consecutive year, GDX plunged about 14 percent. Even with today's move, investors seem to be split regarding the near-term fate for GDX and related ETFs. In a research note published today, Street One Financial Vice President Paul Weisbruch says that more than $400 million in assets have departed GDX over the past week. Conversely, Weisbruch also says recent call options activity in GDX and its small-cap equivalent, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), has been above average. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) is another ETF that is getting on the good times for gold miners today. NUGT, the triple-leveraged equivalent of GDX, is soaring by almost 6.3 percent in what is looking one of the ETF's best days in months. Over the past year, NUGT has plunged nearly 56 percent. NUGT and GDXJ have seen net creations recently, but not of notable asset size. The Miners have lagged broad based equity benchmarks terribly in the trailing one and five year periods, so investors in that space are likely looking for a lift of off recent lows, said Weisbruch.

2013-01-15,S&P Sees Further Upside For Gold,"While major gold ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) have been lethargic to start 2013, leading some traders to ponder the fate of the yellow metal's 12-year winning streak, some analysts and investors still see upside ahead for gold. Not surprisingly, part of the near-term bull case for gold centers around the Federal Reserve's plans to keep interest rates near zero through 2015. Given that the Federal Reserve is committed to keeping short-term interest rates at near zero through 2015, we see no opportunity cost for buying and holding gold anytime soon. Low short-term interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold as an investment, S&P Capital IQ said in a research note. S&P Capital IQ does not have ratings on the marquee gold mining ETFs, such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), but the research firm sees opportunities with what previously been a disappointing group among sector ETFs. Despite higher gold prices, global mine production has been stagnant for over a decade, said the research firm. We believe production will remain stagnant for the next several years, as old mines are becoming depleted and are not being replaced to the extent needed to significantly lift output. Through the first three quarters of 2012, mine production fell 1.9%. The research firm sees countries, such as China, with large dollar reserves looking to diversify away from the greenback and into larger gold holdings. Additionally, we think that gold will rise in all currencies due to the implementation of quantitative easing by central banks worldwide, S&P said. S&P is bullish on some individual gold miners, including Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD), both of which garner four-star S&P ratings. S&P has a three-star rating on Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM). Barrick is GDX's largest holding with a weight of almost 12.1 percent. Newmont is that ETF's third-largest holding with an allocation of nearly eight percent. Despite gold futures rising over the past year, the $8.7 billion GDX is off 15 percent in that time. The more volatile GDXJ has been even worse, tumbling 23.1 percent over the same time. However, some traders have noted an uptick in share creations for GDXJ in recent weeks, a potentially bullish sign. Additionally, S&P notes that GDXJ could outperform GDX in a rapidly rising gold price environment. GDXJ has $2.5 billion in assets and an annual expense ratio of 0.54 percent.

2013-01-24,Bet Against Einhorn on Iron Ore With These ETFs,"It is now widely known that hedge fund legend David Einhorn is bearish on iron ore producers. If his comments to that effect in October 2012 did convince investors of that fact, then Greenlight Capital's letter to clients issued earlier this week should do the trick. In that letter, Greenlight says it holds a bearish view of iron ore equities and that is has shorted a number of stocks in the sector. Without knowing exactly which iron ore stocks Greenlight is short and when those positions were initiated, grading the success of Greenlight's trades is difficult. What is known is that Einhorn spoke bearishly about iron ore and steel names as far back as October 2012 and if he opted to short stocks such as BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) an Vale (NYSE: VALE), the world's largest iron producer, back then there is a good chance those trades are not going in his favor. The reason being is that the Chinese economy has started to turn for the better, causing iron ore prices to surge. While there is no exchange-traded product backed by iron ore futures, there are plenty that hold stocks such as BHP and Vale. Investors can use some of the following funds to bet on high iron ore prices while potentially profiting from what could be a rare misstep by Einhorn. iShares S&P Global Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: MXI) Vale, BHP and Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) are the world's three largest iron ore producers and that trio combines for almost 18 percent of MXI's weight. That gives this ETF plenty of exposure to increasing demand and prices for the commodity used in the production of steel. The resurgent Chinese economy has been a boon for MXI as the fund has gained over eight percent in the past 90 days. However, investors need to note exactly what they are getting involved with with MXI. Meaning this ETF is about much more than iron ore production. MXI is also home to chemicals producers such as DuPont (NYSE: DD) and Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) along with fertilizer names such as Potash (NYSE: POT). Those factors are not the big sticking points with MXI, though. MXI's issue that investors need to be cautious of is exposure to gold miners, one of the more uncooperative sub-segments of the materials universe. In the past three months, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is off almost 12.5 percent. MXI's exposure to pure play gold miners is not significant enough to make this ETF a loser as iron ore prices rise, but the fund's exposure to gold mining equities is enough to mute MXI's upside. iShares MSCI Australia Index Fund (NYSE: EWA) A predictable choice given that Australia is one of the world's largest iron ore-producing countries and that China is Australia's largest trading partner. BHP, EWA's largest holding, and Rio Tinto combine for over 15 percent of EWA's weight. Both companies are diversified mining firms, but both are also highly dependent on iron ore as a revenue and profit driver. In 2011 iron ore accounted for 42 percent of BHP's profits. In the same year, Rio Tinto derived nearly half its revenue from iron ore production. Global X China Materials ETF (NYSE: CHIM) China is often perceived as the primary destination for imported iron ore, but it must be noted the world's second-largest economy is looking to reduce its dependence on imported iron ore. China is seeking to reduce dependence on imported iron ore by increasing the proportion of domestic iron ore to forty-five percent by 2015. China is already the world's largest steel producer, so its efforts to increase domestic iron ore production make sense, particularly at a time when prices are rising. Morgan Stanley expects iron prices to average $133 per ton this year and that China will increase shipments 12 percent, according to Bloomberg. CHIM is small (just $2.8 million in assets under management) and its average daily volume is less than 4,800 shares. On the other hand, the ETF has surged 15.5 percent in the past three months, outperforming the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) by nearly 400 basis points along the way.

The reason being is that the Chinese economy has started to turn for the better, causing iron ore prices to surge. While there is no exchange-traded product backed by iron ore futures, there are plenty that hold stocks such as BHP and Vale. Investors can use some of the following funds to bet on high iron ore prices while potentially profiting from what could be a rare misstep by Einhorn. iShares S&P Global Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: MXI) Vale, BHP and Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) are the world's three largest iron ore producers and that trio combines for almost 18 percent of MXI's weight. That gives this ETF plenty of exposure to increasing demand and prices for the commodity used in the production of steel. The resurgent Chinese economy has been a boon for MXI as the fund has gained over eight percent in the past 90 days. However, investors need to note exactly what they are getting involved with with MXI. Meaning this ETF is about much more than iron ore production. MXI is also home to chemicals producers such as DuPont (NYSE: DD) and Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) along with fertilizer names such as Potash (NYSE: POT). Those factors are not the big sticking points with MXI, though. MXI's issue that investors need to be cautious of is exposure to gold miners, one of the more uncooperative sub-segments of the materials universe. In the past three months, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is off almost 12.5 percent. MXI's exposure to pure play gold miners is not significant enough to make this ETF a loser as iron ore prices rise, but the fund's exposure to gold mining equities is enough to mute MXI's upside. iShares MSCI Australia Index Fund (NYSE: EWA) A predictable choice given that Australia is one of the world's largest iron ore-producing countries and that China is Australia's largest trading partner. BHP, EWA's largest holding, and Rio Tinto combine for over 15 percent of EWA's weight. Both companies are diversified mining firms, but both are also highly dependent on iron ore as a revenue and profit driver. In 2011 iron ore accounted for 42 percent of BHP's profits. In the same year, Rio Tinto derived nearly half its revenue from iron ore production. Global X China Materials ETF (NYSE: CHIM) China is often perceived as the primary destination for imported iron ore, but it must be noted the world's second-largest economy is looking to reduce its dependence on imported iron ore. China is seeking to reduce dependence on imported iron ore by increasing the proportion of domestic iron ore to forty-five percent by 2015. China is already the world's largest steel producer, so its efforts to increase domestic iron ore production make sense, particularly at a time when prices are rising. Morgan Stanley expects iron prices to average $133 per ton this year and that China will increase shipments 12 percent, according to Bloomberg. CHIM is small (just $2.8 million in assets under management) and its average daily volume is less than 4,800 shares. On the other hand, the ETF has surged 15.5 percent in the past three months, outperforming the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) by nearly 400 basis points along the way.

2013-02-04,"As Mining ETFs Wilt, This One Stands Tall ","Following glum performances in 2012, gold mining stocks and the corresponding ETFs are up to more of the same in early 2013. A common criticism of gold mining equities and ETFs has been that the miners have not been, at least not in recent memory, participating in the upside of the yellow metal they extract from the earth. That leaves gold miners vulnerable to increase downside potential when gold futures languish, a scenario that is playing out this year. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) was off 1.05 percent heading into the start of trading Monday. Things were for worse for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which is off 10 percent year-to-date and that includes Monday's modest gain. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) has been better though that is not saying much. With Monday's one percent decline, GDXJ is now off 7.8 percent since the start of the year. The situation is worse with silver. Year-to-date, the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) is up 2.5 percent, but the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) has plunged over 10 percent. Investors looking to participate in upside for miners do not need to look for. They just need to shift their view away from the usual suspects, also known as gold and silver miners because one small ETF has delivered big returns to start the year. That fund is the First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (NASDAQ: PLTM). Buoyed by sharply higher platinum at the hands of more labor strife in South Africa, among other catalysts, platinum futures have surged to start 2013. The ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT), which is backed by physical holdings of the white metal, have jumped over eight percent to start 2013. The First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund has been solid as well. Actually, PLTM's 4.7 percent year-to-date gain is downright stellar in comparison to the aforementioned gold and silver miners ETFs. Some platinum miners produce more than just that metal. Those companies produce other platinum-group metals, including palladium. That has been a good thing this year as palladium prices have soared thanks to robust auto sales data in the U.S.. Palladium is used in the production of catalytic converters in most cars produced in China and the U.S., the world's two largest automobile markets. Improved auto sales have helped lift the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) by more than seven percent year-to-date. Combined, bullishness in platinum and palladium futures is clearly helping PLTM. Investors might think that playing a country-specific with platinum-group exposure is a wise idea. In theory, it should be and the play would be the iShares MSCI South Africa Index Fund (NYSE: EZA) because South Africa is the world's largest platinum-producing nation and the second-largest palladium producer behind Russia. That has not been the case as EZA has offered essentially no correlation to platinum and palladium futures this year as evidenced by the fund's 5.8 percent year-to-date tumble. On the other hand, South Africa accounts for almost 36.4 percent of PLTM's country weight, by far that ETF's largest country exposure. That indicates PLTM has not been hampered by labor unrest in South Africa to this point. Canada and the U.K. combine for over 30 percent of PLTM's weight, leaving a 7.25 allocation to Russia as the ETF's only remaining legitimate political risk. Russia could actually be a catalyst for PLTM going forward as some here."
2013-02-05,Technical Problems Looming For Gold Miners ETF,"As if things could not get any worse for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which has mired in a death spiral of sorts since mid-September, one noted technical analyst points that things can get worse for the downtrodden ETF. In new blog post, Chris Kimble of the eponymous Kimble Charting Solutions notes if GDX violates support in the $42.15 area, the ETF could head a good deal lower. Kimble also points out that GDX has been creating a series of bearish upside wicks, a candlestick pattern that indicates sellers are scurrying back into GDX at any sign the ETF might be poised to bounce. Those sellers have been successful. GDX is down 14.3 percent over the past 90 days while S&P 500 is up 5.4 percent over the same time. Factor in Tuesday's 1.2 percent gain and SPY is up 6.6 percent over that time horizon. Frustrating GDX investors is the fact that ETFs backed by physical gold have not been much in the past three months. Over that time, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) is lower by just 0.75 percent. The chasm between GDX and ETFs such as GLD reminds investors that when the miners did not participate in gold's upside it was probably a sign the miners would fall faster if futures retreated. That has been the case since early November. As for GDX, the ETF needs to hold is April/July 2012 lows (the ETF flirted with $40 in July), or a good deal of sellers could come forward and push GDX a large percentage lower, said Kimble. Investors looking to profit from GDX violating critical support levels can consider the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST). DUST offers three times the daily inverse returns of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDM), the underlying index for GDX. DUST has surged more than 38 percent in the past 90 days.

2013-02-12,Mining Exposure May be Hindering Peru ETF,"Well-documented are the trials and tribulations experienced by precious metal mining stocks and ETFs over the past 12 to 18 months. Amid technical problems, among other issues, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has plunged more than 11 percent year-to-date. Unfortunately, mining sector woes may be catching up with one of 2012's top-performing Latin America ETFs, the iShares MSCI All Peru Capped Index Fund (NYSE: EPU). The iShares MSCI All Peru Capped Index Fund tracks South America's fastest-growing economy, one that is heavily dependent on the export of precious and industrial metals and other raw materials. Earlier this year, EPU was spotted making new highs, but the fund has dropped 3.4 percent in the past month. EPU's month-long slide is concerning on multiple levels, not the least of which is the fact that the fund is the worst performer over that time of the four largest country-specific ETFs tracking South American nations. Even the downtrodden iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ) has outpaced EPU in the past 30 days. EPU is also declining after Peru reported December GDP growth of 6.83 percent, up from 6.71 percent in November. That easily topped the 6.2 percent analysts expected. Many analysts and banks are forecasting Peruvian GDP growth of six percent this year. Even if the World Bank estimate of Peruvian 2013 GDP growth of 5.8 percent proves accurate, the country will still sport better growth than Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. Statistics like that add to the near-term concern over EPU's retrenchment and perhaps highlight the fact the declines in mining stocks are finally starting to take a bite out of an ETF that last year proved impervious to that sector's problems. Unlike the iShares MSCI Chile Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: ECH), which is erroneously viewed as a commodities play despite a materials only representing 14.4 percent of ECH's weight, EPU is a commodities/materials ETF. The materials sector accounts for nearly 49 percent of EPU's weight. Peru is a top-five copper producer. The country is the world's silver producing-nation. In 2011, Peru was the world's sixth-largest gold producer. In particular, Peru's status as a major gold and silver producer appears to be what has recently been ailing EPU. On Monday, Compañía de Minas Buenaventura (NYSE: BVN), EPU's third-largest holding with an allocation of nearly 10 percent, plunged and it appears volatility in that name is increasing. Add to that Peru's December 2012 trade surplus plunged to $679 million from $1.3 billion surplus a year earlier as exports fell 16 percent, Bloomberg reported. Waning demand for copper and precious metals lead to the December decline. With the mining sector being far from nirvana, EPU presents a dichotomy to investors. With miners representing nearly half of the ETF's weight, there is near-term risk. Still, there is a bull case for EPU and Peru. The aforementioned growth statistics fortify that assertion. Peru's government balance sheet is sturdy. Jim O'Neill of Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and BRIC acronym fame, recently wrote in Barron's that along with Chile and Colombia there is great excitement and change in Peru. The easy way of looking at EPU at the moment is to wait and see if it holds support at $46. If it does not, $43 is likely the next stop on the way down and that could be a compelling entry point for prescient investors. For more on Peru, click here."
2013-02-13,Investing In Gold Miners While Balancing Leverage And Risk,"The Appeal Of Gold Investors wary of a weakening dollar have long been drawn to gold. The supply of dollars is determined by Federal Reserve policy, which can vary widely, but increases in the supply of gold are constrained by mainly by how much of it can be mined, and global gold mining production has been quite steady since 1997, averaging about 80 million ounces. The Appeal Of Gold Mining Stocks Versus Gold For investors who are bullish on gold, the inherent operating leverage of gold miners can make gold mining stocks such as Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE: ABX) and Goldcorp, Inc. (NYSE: GG) attractive: as gold prices rise higher above gold miners' fixed costs of production, miners' profits can rise faster than the price of gold itself. Diversifying Against Stock-Specific Risk Investors who want to diversify the stock-specific risk of investing in gold miners can do so buy buying a basket of mining stocks, either directly, or via an ETF such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which includes Barrick Gold and Goldcorp as its two largest holdings. Adding Leverage Gold investors who want to add leverage to their portfolios can consider the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares ETF (NYSE: NUGT), which holds the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF and seeks to return 300% of the daily movement of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. The Downside Of Leveraged ETFs The downside of leveraged ETFs is their potential downside: we're just about six weeks into 2013, and unhedged NUGT longs who bought the ETF at the beginning of the year are already down more than 29%, as of Tuesday's close. Reining In The Risk Of A Leveraged Gold Miner ETF As we noted in a recent post, hedging a security against a greater-than-20% drop can offer a reasonable compromise between limiting downside risk and lowering the cost of hedging. Unsurprisingly for such a volatile ETF (as of Tuesday, the 52-week high and low prices on NUGT were $26.69 and $7.62, respectively), its puts are expensive. On Tuesday, NUGT was too expensive to hedge against a greater-than-20% drop using optimal puts*. That's because the cost of hedging it against a greater-than-20% drop over the next several months was itself greater than 20% of position value. The smallest decline threshold against which it was possible to hedge NUGT on Tuesday over that time frame was 25%. These were the optimal puts to hedge 1000 shares of NUGT against a greater-than-25% drop by September 20th, as of Tuesday's close: As you can see in the screen capture above, the cost of those optimal puts, as a percentage of position, was almost as high as that decline threshold: 24.05%. It's hard to imagine any investor would want to take a 24% hit to hedge against a >25% drop. Just as NUGT's puts were expensive on Tuesday, though, so were its calls. By combining the right long puts and short calls on NUGT into a collar, an investor could have dramatically lowered his hedging costs. Not Too Expensive To Hedge With Optimal Collars A NUGT investor interested in hedging against a greater-than-20% decline between now and September 20th, but also willing to cap his potential upside at 13% over that time frame, could have used the optimal collar** below to hedge 1000 shares on Tuesday instead. As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the net cost of this optimal collar is negative -- meaning the NUGT investor would be getting paid to hedge in this case, an amount equal to 6.33% of his position value. Calculating Net Cost Conservatively It's worth noting, that, to be conservative, the cost of the puts above was calculated using their ask price, and, also to be conservative, the income from the calls was calculated using their bid price. Since, in practice, an investor can often buy puts for less than their ask price (i.e., some price between the bid and ask), and an investor can often sell calls for more than their bid price (again, for some price between the bid and ask), a NUGT investor opening this optimal collar on Tuesday would likely have been paid more than 6.33% of his position to do so. Worst Case Scenario For the purposes of this example, we'll assume our hypothetical investor just got paid 6.33% of his position to open that collar. What's his worst case scenario? That would be his NUGT shares dropping by more than 20%. If that happened, the investor's losses on the ETF would be limited to 20%, but remember, he made 6.33% when he opened that collar. So, taking that into account, his worst case downside here would be a net loss of 13.67%. Best Case Scenario The best case scenario for an investor who opened this collar would be for NUGT to rise 13% or more. If that happened, the investor's NUGT shares would get called away, so his upside there would be capped at 13%. But add in the 6.33% the investor made when he opened the collar, and he would have a total gain of 19.33% *Optimal puts are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest possible cost. Portfolio Armor uses an algorithm developed by a finance Ph.D to sort through and analyze all of the available puts for your stocks and ETFs, scanning for the optimal ones. **Optimal collars are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest net cost, while not limiting your potential upside by more than you specify.

2013-02-14,"Einhorn's Greenlight Adds Google Shares, Apple Calls","David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital added shares of Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), the world's largest provider of Internet search services, to its stable of holdings in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to a 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing was made public Thursday after the close of U.S. markets. Greenlight held 63,000 shares of Google at the end of the fourth quarter, according to the filing. The hedge fund also held 275,000 call options in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) at the end of the quarter, the filing indicates. Einhorn is pushing Apple to issue preferred stock with a dividend as a way of deploying some of the iPad maker's massive $137 billion cash hoard. Greenlight held just over 1.3 million shares of Apple at the end of last year, about what it held at the end of the third quarter. Greenlight continues to hold 50,000 put options on Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE: CMG) as well as roughly 6 million shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). The hedge fund maintained significant stakes in Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and General Motors (NYSE: GM) at the end of last year."
2013-02-15,"Einhorn, Soros Differ on Gold Mining ETFs","The woes of gold mining stocks and ETFs, in particular the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), have been a frequent topic of conversation among traders for over a year now. The story goes like this: Gold miners vexed traders and investors by not rising in unison with gold futures. That much is evident by the fact that GDX, the largest gold miners ETF by assets, is down 31 percent over the past two years. Over the same time, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the largest ETF backed by holdings of physical gold, is up 17 percent. Not surprisingly as ETFs such as GLD have recently faltered (that fund is off 6.3 percent in the past 90 days), the losses have been worse for the likes of GDX. Over the same 90-day period, GDX is down 13.1 percent, more than double GLD's loss. Ongoing downward spirals for GDX and its constituents might be the reason George Soros parted ways with a significant chunk of his stake in that ETF during the fourth quarter. Soros owned 1.5 million shares of GDX at the end of the fourth quarter, compared 2.3 million shares at the end of the third. \ Soros also sold 400,000 shares of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) during the fourth quarter to bring his stake in that ETF to 2 million shares. David Einhorn apparently has a different view of the matter. Einhorn's Greenlight Capital owned approximately 6 million shares of GDX at the end of the fourth quarter, according to the hedge fund's most recent 13F filing. That is roughly the same amount of GDX Greenlight owned at the end of the previous quarter. While this does not amount to a Bill Ackman versus Carl Icahn type of tussle, it looks like Soros was right to trim his exposure to GDX and GDXJ. On the other hand, Einhorn is dealing with a falling knife in GDX. On February 5, Chris Kimble of the eponymous Kimble Charting Solutions noted that if GDX violated support around $42.15, the ETF was doomed to more downside. That was just nine trading days ago and today GDX is off more than three percent on volume that has already surpassed the daily average. The ETF is struggling to hold the $40 mark. Making matters all the more dangerous for Einhorn and his fellow GDX investors is the fact that gold futures are at a critical juncture. This week, bullion has struggled to stay above the psychologically important $1,650 per ounce area. As Kimble notes, further deterioration from here could mean gold futures test $1,300. That would mean GLD would likely fall to around $130, a roughly 16 percent decline from current levels. While it must be noted that GDX does not move with GLD on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it also cannot be forgotten that the former's recent slide is more than twice as worse as the latter's. If that trend holds, gold futures do test $1,300 and GLD falls 16 percent, GDX could tumble 30 percent or more. That means the Direxion Daily Gold 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) becomes all the more alluring. As it is, when accounting for Friday's gain of more than 10 percent, DUST is up more than 39 percent in the past month. As a leveraged ETF, DUST is not meant to be held for long time frames, but the returns indicate that it is the best way to play gold miners in the short-term. For more on gold miners, click here."
2013-02-20,Gold's Death Cross Hastens Mining ETFs Death Spirals,"The big news out of the gold pits Wednesday is that futures violated the psychologically important $1,600 an ounce level. At this writing, Comex-traded gold is trading just under $1,568 per ounce. Arguably, the bigger news is the technical condition gold's slide has caused. That being the ominous death cross, the technical scenario under which a security's 50-day moving average falls below its 200-day line. It happened with gold futures and it would appear that it is just a matter of time before the same fate befalls the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Not surprisingly, gold trading at six-month lows and violating key technical areas has proven to be another nail in the coffin of gold mining ETFs. Earlier this month, Benzinga reported on looming technical issues for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). That report cited a technical analyst that said if GDX, the largest gold miners ETF by assets, fellow below $42.15, the bad times could keep on coming. As of Wednesday, that call has proven to be 100 accurate. GDX is off four percent in late trading and trading around $37.80. Should GDX closed below $38 today, it will be the first time the ETF has done that since July 2009. GDX's all-time low of $17.80 seen in October 2008 is obviously a long way off, but at around $38, the ETF is trading near a price that it saw soon after its May 2006 debut. Regarding the death cross, GDX beat bullion to the punch, having committed that offense early this year. GDX is not alone. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is off 3.8 percent today and is trading at $16 as of this writing. That would be a new all-time closing low for the ETF, which debuted in November 2009. If GDXJ closes right at $16, it will have lost 38.4 percent since coming to market. Like GDX, GDXJ made its death cross several weeks. Weakness in gold mining shares, a prominent theme for two years now, if not longer, and that weakness can be felt at the highest levels of the hedge fund universe. As Benzinga reported last week, George Soros has been paring his exposure to GDX and GDXJ. Investors in David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital may be hoping that the hedge fund is behind some of today's selling pressure in GDX. Greenlight owned about 6 million shares of GDX at the end of the fourth quarter, according to a recent 13F filing. That position, if Greenlight still maintains it, is certainly worth less today than it was at the end of last year. GDX spent much of October and November trading in the high $40s and low $50s before diving to the mid $40s in December. Not surprisingly, today's worst offender in the gold mining ETF realm is a leveraged play, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT). Down over 10 percent today and more than 34 percent in the past month, NUGT languishes below $6 a share. In the world of leveraged ETFs, a fund with that price tag will only keep it for so long before it travels down Reverse Split Boulevard. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) will not be seeing a reverse split anytime soon. DUST, the one gold mining ETF that is worth a look these days, is up 51.5 percent in the past month and that does NOT include today's 12.1 percent gain. For more on mining ETFs, click here."

2013-04-01,Materials Mess: These ETFs Are in Trouble,"These are not the best of times for materials stocks and the corresponding ETFs. In the first quarter, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) gained 4.8 percent. While that does not sound terrible, it is less than half the 10.5 percent returned by the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). XLB's performance also makes it the worst of the nine sector SPDRs. In fact, seven of the nine sector SPDRs offered double-digit first-quarter returns with only the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) joining XLB in the single-digit club. Still, XLK's 5.4 percent first-quarter gain is far better than XLB's performance. Unfortunately for materials bulls, XLB looks like one of the better ETFs tracking this sector. Year-to-date, Monsanto (NYSE: MON) an DuPont (NYSE: DD) are up 9.86 percent and 7.17 percent, respectively. Those stocks combine for over 21 percent of XLB's weight. XLB has also been helped by the fact metals miners account for just 17 percent of the ETF's weight. Other materials ETFs have not been so fortunate and several now look imperiled. Take the case of the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). The $609.3 million XME plunged 10.3 percent in the first quarter and that was before Monday's two percent loss (as of 1:30 PM Eastern time). XME has an ominous sub-sector mix. Alone, gold miners account for 10.4 percent of the fund's weight and as if that is not bad enough, other metals miners account for another 11.6 percent while coal and consumable fuels names represent 17.3 percent, according to State Street data. Making matters worse is the fact that last week XME made a death cross, the technical scenario where a shorter term moving average crosses below a longer term average. In the case of XME, its 50-day moving average is now slightly below its 200-day line. Speaking of coal stocks, 2013 is proving to be another tough year for that group. Add in Monday's almost 1.6 percent slide and the Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL) is now off 10.2 percent year-to-date. KOL has not made a death cross yet, but the chart indicates it may just be a matter of time. In another bad sign for KOL, at least four of its top-10 holdings – Joy Global (NYSE: JOY), Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU), Yanzhou Coal (NYSE: YZC) and Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT) – reside below their 200-day moving averages. Those stocks combine for over 21 percent of KOL's weight. If KOL violates support at $22.50, a return to $20 seems likely. Things are not much better for global materials names. The iShares S&P Global Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: MXI) is now down 5.7 percent this year when accounting for Monday's 0.9 percent loss. A 44 percent weight to metals miners has proven problematic and MXI is now struggling to hold support at its 200-day line. Additionally, MXI allocates 14.5 percent of its weight to various securities issued by BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO). Australian central bankers and policymakers have already acknowledged mining investment there is declining and that the mining boom will peak later this year, implying upside could be limited for these stocks and related fare. Another cause for concern: More than a third of MXI's top-18 holdings have exposure to gold mining. That is not a good thing when the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down 18.4 percent this year. A possible solution for investors looking to profit the woes of the materials sector is the ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN). SMN seeks to deliver twice the daily inverse performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index. That is the index tracked by the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYM). If IYM breaks resistance at $52, a run to $55 could be in the offing.

2013-04-02,Further Confirmation Materials ETFs Are Imperiled,"With the S&P 500 up about 0.7 percent Tuesday and having touched a new record high, it is not hard to find the laggards among sector ETFs. There are a few funds tracking the oil and semiconductor sub-segments that are in the red, but those losses are not yet alarming. The real cause for concern remains the materials sector. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is down 0.54 percent today, and while that may not sound like much, remember that XLB was by far the worst performer of the nine sector SPDRs in the first quarter. XLB's first-quarter gain was not even half of what the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) returned. Tuesday may be just one day, but the problem for XLB and other materials ETFs is that this far from the worst day this year these funds have been laggards. As lower beta sectors such as consumer staples and health care have lead the broader market higher, materials names have under-performed perhaps foreshadowing imminent declines. XLB is not the only materials ETF offender, either. As Benzinga noted on Monday, the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) is in serious technical trouble. That ETF is off another 1.5 percent today and has now lost more than 16.5 percent year-to-date. With gold futures being hammered, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are both off more than three percent. In further proof that traders hate gold mining stocks and reverse splits are a joke, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bull Shares (NYSE: NUGT) is down nearly 11 percent today, the ETF's first trading day after undergoing a four-for-one reverse split. There is more bad news. The iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials Index Fund (NYSE: IYM) is flirting with support in the $68.80 area. A break there probably takes the ETF back to $65-$66. If the Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW) cannot hold $87, it likely returns to $82. Another way of illustrating the dark clouds hanging over materials ETFs right now is this. Look at a heat map of inverse ETFs and exclude the ones that are trading on a post-split basis today. The noteworthy, legitimate gainer is the ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN), which is close to staging a breakout of its own. SMN is not the largest nor is it the most heavily traded inverse ETF out there. However, it is up nearly one percent on a day when the S&P 500 hit a new record high and that is not a good sign for long materials ETFs. For more on materials ETFs, click here."
2013-04-03,Inverse ETFs For April Showers,"Yes, April is just days old. And yes, Wednesday's declines come on the heels of the S&P 500 touching a new record high on Tuesday. So perhaps it is too early to get worked up about April being a bad month for stocks. Historically, April is actually a good month for the bulls as the fourth month of the year is last month in the best six-month cycle in which to be long equities. On the other hand, that does not mean the broader market rises every April. Additionally, fortune favors the prepared and with that in mind, traders will want to consider the following inverse ETFs if Wednesday's glum price action is repeated throughout this month. ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN) Not to beat a dead horse, but these are not good days for the materials sector. The first sign of weakness was easily spotted during the first quarter when the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) was the worst-performing of the nine sector SPDRs funds. The negativity surrounding this sector has accelerated in recent days. With regards to SMN, this ETF is the inverse, double-leveraged play on the Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index. That is the same index tracked by the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYM). While IYM is about two-thirds allocated to chemicals names, it is vulnerable to being a baby thrown out with the materials sector bathwater. The ETF is not particularly heavy on coal and steel names, but it includes a few such as Consol Energy (NYSE: CNX), Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF) and U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) further down its lineup. That is bad news for IYM, but good news for traders that opt to give SMN a short-term spin. Multiple steel names are trading at multi-month or multi-year lows. Coal equities and the corresponding ETF are in bad shape as well, buoying the short-term bull case for SMN. ProShares UltraShort MSCI Brazil (NYSE: BZQ) Speaking of weakness in the materials sector, Brazil's Vale (NYSE: VALE), the world's largest iron ore maker, is lower by 20 percent in the past 90 days. And that is with the benefit of Wednesday's two percent gain. Two Vale securities account for 9.7 percent of the weight of the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ), making the stock that ETF's second-largest holdings behind another epic Brazilian disappointment, Petrobras (NYSE: PBR). The simple way of explaining BZQ is that is that is essentially the double-leveraged, inverse equivalent of EWZ. The cautionary tale with BZQ is that it is thinly traded (average daily volume of just 13,640 shares) and that can make for some large intraday moves on a print-by-print basis. The upside is that Brazil continues to be a laggard in 2013, the largest emerging markets of which Brazil is one have been slack performers and there is little reason to be long materials, EWZ's second-largest sector weight. All those factors play in BZQ's favor. Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) Things are getting worse for gold. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) is playing a dangerous game with support in the $150 area and a move below that level would likely invite increased selling pressure. GLD is off 2.6 percent in the past week. A familiar situation is playing out in the gold pits that means DUST could have plenty more upside ahead of it and that is saying something because the ETF has more than doubled year-to-date. While GLD is down 2.6 percent in the past week, the miners are once again performing worse. Much worse. Much worse as in the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down 7.4 percent in the past five trading days. In anecdotal evidence regarding investors' disdain for gold miners, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) underwent a reverse split on April and open for trading at a post-split price of just over $25 on Tuesday. NUGT is already flirting with $21. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-04-03,Interesting Wednesday Action in Inverse ETFs,"On the back of some slack economic data, surging U.S. oil inventories and speculation that the Federal Reserve could end its bond-buying program as soon as this summer, U.S. stocks plunged Wednesday. The tumble came just a day after the S&P 500 touched a new record high. One day of glum market action does not necessarily mean the start of an imminent, savage downturn. Still, Wednesday's action in select inverse ETFs may be a sign that more downside is on the way. At least for countries and sectors these ETFs track. At this point, it should go without saying that leveraged ETFs, both the bullish and bearish plays, are short-term instruments. Knowing that, the plethora of critics this asset class has might be apt to say these ETFs are not the best harbingers of things to come. That point can be argued, but in the cases of select bearish funds, Wednesday's action was merely the extension of recent trends and those trends should not be ignored. Bad Emerging Markets Continue to be Bad Well-documented have been the struggles of the largest emerging markets, BRIC in particular, this year. That was again the case on Wednesday. Start with the ProShares UltraShort Brazil (NYSE: BZQ). That double leveraged bearish play on sagging Brazilian equities, was up almost one percent Wednesday. Naysayers will point the below average volume and that is a fair argument. On a related note, China bulls will not like the fact that the ProShares UltraShort FTSE China 25 (NYSE: FXP) gained 3.7 percent on more than double the average daily turnover. FXP also broke downtrend line resistance and could make a run to its 200-day moving average in the coming days. The Direxion Daily Russia Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: RUSS) gained more than six percent on more than double its average daily volume while the Direxion Daily Emerging Markets Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: EDZ) added over three percent, also on better than double the normal trade. Strong volume across EDZ, FXP and RUSS is not a good sign for BRIC bulls. Energy Weakens Name a major energy ETF and chances are it closed in the red Wednesday. The Energy Select SPDR (NYSE: XLE) and the Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSE: VDE) were both down more than 1.6 percent while the Market Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSE: OIH) dropped 2.1 percent on volume that was about 25 percent higher than usual. Again, just one day of price action is being referred to here, but energy has been one of the only higher beta sectors to show any leadership this year in what has predominantly been a low beta rally at the sector level. Cause for concern? Maybe. The ProShares UltraShort Oil & Gas (NYSE: DUG) gained 3.3 percent on volume that was about 80 percent higher than usual. The Golden Goose May be Cooked It has been said that gold is a safe-haven investment. Lately, that has not been the case and it now looks like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and related ETFs are flirting with technical disaster. GLD lost 1.1 percent Wednesday on volume that was nearly 50 percent above the daily average. On the other hand, the PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) added 2.1 percent on volume that roughly 25 percent above normal. Things are far worse for the miners. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) plunged 4.5 percent on volume that 2.6 times above normal. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) tumbled nearly 14 percent to close at $20.52. Following a reverse split, NUGT opened for trading Tuesday at just over $26. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST) loves all this. On better than double its average turnover, DUST jumped 13.4 percent Wednesday. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-04-14,A Look Ahead: This Week's ETFs to Watch ,"Last week was another strong one for U.S. stocks as the S&P 500 climbed 2.3 percent in what was benchmark index's best performance since the first week of the year. The SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) is now up 8.7 percent year-to-date. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 2.1 percent and both indexes touched new record highs on Thursday before inching lower on Friday. With another strong week in the books, the catalysts are in place to keep moving stocks higher – or drag them lower – because earnings season is about to bring an avalanche of reports this week. Of the 30 S&P 500 companies that reported first-quarter results thus far, 70 percent exceeded analysts' profit estimates and 57 percent beat sales projections, according to Bloomberg data. With 74 S&P 500 constituents due to deliver earnings updates this week, plenty of ETFs will be in play, including the following group. Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) kicked off bank earnings last Friday. This week, Citigroup (NYSE: C) gets the ball rolling Monday, followed by Goldman Sachs Tuesday and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) on Wednesday. That trio combines for nearly 14 percent of the Financial Select Sector SPDR's weight. Two other XLF top-10 holdings, US Bancorp (NYSE: USB) and American Express (NYSE: AXP), also report this week along with a broad swath of smaller components in this ETF. All of that is one way of saying that there will be ample opportunities for XLF to climb another one percent to reclaim its 52-week and maybe even break resistance in the $18.90 area. With all these potential catalysts, the next week or two could represent the last great opportunity XLF has to make a new leg higher before the sell in May and go away crowd comes to town. Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) Over the past few months, either DUST or its bullish cousin, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT), have made regular appearances on this list. There is good reason to revisit DUST once again this week. Gold is coming off one its most savage weekly beatings in multiple years last week. Of course, that is not good news for the miners. Just look at the chart of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). NUGT reverse split earlier this month and the post-split price was about $26 a share. The ETF lost 17.5 percent on volume that was more than quadruple the daily average on Friday to close at $16.71 Friday. Reverse splits rarely work with ETFs and NUGT is proving to be no exception to that rule. DUST remains the best way of play gold miners until further notice. Vanguard Health Care ETF (NYSE: VHT) Confirming the low-beta nature of this rally, health care names have played an integral part in driving stocks higher this year. That scenario has certainly reward investors in the Vanguard Health Care ETF, which is up nearly 20 percent year-to-date. A potentially big week looms for VHT as top-10 holdings Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Abbott Labs (NYSE: ABT) and UnitedHealth (NYSE: UNH) all step into the earnings confessional. That trio represents over 19 percent of VHT's weight. VHT and rival funds such as the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV) will be in play starting this week and stretching into the first week of May as this sector's earnings seasons kicks into high gear. VHT just broke above long-term resistance at $85 and if the reports and guidance are strong from the likes of Johnson & Johnson, Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and others, this is one ETF that should keep trucking higher.

2013-04-15,Gold Mining ETFs: Worse Before It's Better,"By now, it is not unreasonable to say nearly anyone with a television or Internet access knows that gold is in full-fledged bear market. That much was confirmed with last Friday's 4.1 percent tumble, which had bullion residing more than 20 percent below its record high seen in August 2011. It looks like things are going to get worse before they get better for gold as the yellow metal is careening toward its worst one-day loss since 1980 during Monday's trading session. Predictably, gold's tumble is bad news for shares of the companies that extract the precious metal from the earth. At various points during gold's unprecedented 12-year bull market, shares of the miners frequently lagged gold futures and ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), bewildering investors in the process. The situation for the miners and the corresponding ETFs is getting worse. On Monday, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has slid 8.6 percent on volume that is already more than 50 percent above the daily average. Including Monday's tumble, GDX is down more than 16 percent in just the past five trading days. If years of under-performing gold futures was not a clue, investors got another regarding the miners in early February about GDX. That is when Chris Kimble of the eponymous Kimble Charting Solutions noted that if GDX violated support around $42.15, the ETF would continue plunging. Plunge it has. GDX is trading below $29.50 at this writing. It is easy to understand why. Over the past five trading days, Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) are off an average of more than 16 percent. Those are GDX's three largest holdings and combine for over 30 percent of the downtrodden ETF's weight. At around $29.50, GDX is trading more than 22 percent below its debut price of $38 in May 2006 and risks closing below $30 for the first time since December 2008. This is how dreadful GDX has been in the past week: Peru's Buenaventura Mines (NYSE: BVN) is the best performer among the ETF's top-10 holdings with a loss of 10.2 percent. Leveraged ETF Worse...Much Worse GDX tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDM) and there is one bullish leveraged ETF that tracks the same index: The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3x Shares (NYSE: NUGT). This ETF has a memorable ticker, but has been offering up plenty of forgettable performances lately. Obviously, as a triple-leveraged ETF, NUGT has been performing much worse than GDX, something that was fairly easy to spot. On April 3, NUGT's bearish cousin, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST), was highlighted as one of the bearish ETFs to buy in April. Since that call, DUST is up more than 38 percent, including Monday's 23 percent surge. The recommendation on DUST was due in part to the belief that NUGT's 1-for-5 reverse spilt, which went into effect after the close on April 1, would not have the desired effect of propping the share up for long. That assumption proved accurate as NUGT opened for trading on April at a post-split price of just over $26 a share. In less than two full weeks since that reverse split, NUGT has been cut in half and is down 23.6 percent today on volume that has already eclipsed five times the daily average. If current trends hold, NUGT may be heading for another reverse split in a matter of weeks. As for DUST, Direxion may need to initiate a forward split because it seems to be a matter of when not if that ETF trades over $100. For more on gold mining ETFs, click here."
2013-04-15,Einhorn Could Have a Mining ETF Problem,"Last week, when shares of J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) plunged and rumors about Herbalife (NYSE: HLF) going private surfaced, plenty of folks vilified Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital due to the hedge fund's positions in those stocks. Those who enjoy highlighting hedge fund manager trades gone awry may want to consider Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn for this week's wall of shame. Emphasis on may because until the first-quarter 13F filings start rolling in, no one knows for certain whether or not Einhorn's hedge fund still maintains a position in the downtrodden Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). What is not debatable is the fact that Greenlight held 6 million shares of GDX at the end of the fourth quarter. That is the same amount the hedge fund owned at the end of the third quarter of 2012 and, to put things delicately, that trade is not going in Einhorn's favor. GDX, which is home to 31 stocks including Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), was down 31.6 percent year-to-date at the start of trading Monday. That does not include the ETF's 6.8 percent Monday slide. Again, investors will not know if Einhorn still holds a stake in GDX until the first-quarter 13F filings are published, but assuming no changes have been made to that position, Einhorn probably has some explaining to do to Greenlight clients. GDX closed just over $47 on January 2. Even if the ETF closes at $31 today, Einhorn's position would be about $16 per share underwater equaling a loss of $96 million. To be fair to Einhorn, he is not the only noteworthy hedge fund that is being taken to the cleaners by gold miners. At the end of the fourth quarter, John Paulson's Paulson & Co. held stakes in several GDX holdings, including Barrick, Agnico-Eagle Miners (NYSE: AEM), AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE: AU), Gold Fields (NYSE: GFI) and Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD). Those stocks combine for roughly 29 percent of GDX's weight. Paulson & Co. also owned over 21.8 million shares of the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) at the end of the fourth quarter. The largest ETF backed by physical gold is now down more than 19 percent this year. George Soros may be having some problems with GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) as well. While Soros did reduce his positions in those ETFs by 800,000 and 400,000 shares during the fourth quarter, he still owned 1.5 million shares of GDX and about two million shares of GDXJ at the end of the quarter. Including today's loss, GDXJ has lost over 43 percent this year. The ETF closed around $20.50 on January 2 and is currently trading around $12.50. If Soros still holds 2 million shares, he is staring at a loss of $16 million just this year on that one position. To be fair, there is a reasonable chance the aforementioned hedge fund legends, and perhaps some of their colleagues, have been trimming or outright liquidating positions in the miners and ETFs such as GDX. That would explain some of the intense selling pressure in the ETF over the past week. Two things are certain. First, the next 13F filing season is going to be interesting, particularly when it comes to gold mining stocks. Second, investors that have been paying hedge fund managers an upfront fee and a percentage of profits to be involved with bum trades such as GDX are not likely to be pleased, particularly when they realize they could have just bought the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) on their own and generated superior returns relative to the miner's trade.

2013-04-17,Reverse Split Curse Continues For This ETF ,"Sometimes reverse splits work. Sometimes the ploy does not. Broadly speaking, it is fair to say companies and ETF issuers employ reverse splits for cosmetic reasons. Better to have a stock or ETF trading well into the double digits than threatening to fall to $2, $1 or lower goes the conventional thinking. Some stocks have been able to perform well after engineering reverse. Well, a more accurate way of putting it would be to say some stocks have performed admirably well after reverse splits. American International Group (NYSE: AIG) is performing decently this year after a 2009 reverse split. So is Citigroup (NYSE: C) following its 2011 reverse split. Select ETFs can only hope the same fortune befalls them as a reverse split curse of sorts has permeated the ETF world over the past several years. Curses may be the stuff of urban lore, but the reverse split ETF curse is arguably more a reality than the Madden video game cover curse, which held that NFL players appearing on the cover of the popular game were doomed to injury or poor performances. Curse or not, a recent reverse split for the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) just is not working. That much is highlighted by NUGT's 53.2 percent plunge in just the past five trading days. NUGT reverse split on a five-for-one basis after the close on April 1 and opened for trading at around $26 on April 2. Said another way, NUGT has lost more than 62 percent of its value in just 12 trading days. NUGT is designed to deliver three times the daily performance of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDM), the same index tracked by the downtrodden Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). As most investors by now know, gold mining stocks and ETFs ETFs have been under seige. GDX, which earlier this week had $6.4 billion in assets under management but has seen that tally fall to $5.9 billion as of April 16, has lost almost 44 percent in the past year. That slide has helped NUGT keep the ETF reverse split curse alive. Consider these examples. The Guggenheim Solar ETF (NYSE: TAN) has slid over 48 percent since its February reverse split. The Market Vectors Solar ETF (NYSE: KWT) is down about nine percent since its July 2012 reverse split. While the U.S. Natural Gas Fund (NYSE: UNG) has surged over 25 percent this year, the fund has lost more than 93 percent of its value since April 2007 despite multiple reverse splits. This is the illustrious club NUGT now belongs to. That is another way of reiterating that traders ought to consider NUGT's bearish cousin, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST). Rather than dealing with hard-to-borrow fees that are associated with shorting many leveraged ETFs, traders can just go long DUST. DUST is on a race to the stratosphere reminiscent of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) at various points during 2012. Well except for the part where DUST is still going up this year. And speaking of splits, Direxion may want to consider a two-for-one forward split on DUST now that it is trading over $118. If the recent action in gold miners is any indication, DUST will be back in the triple digits in no time while another reverse split probably awaits NUGT. For more on gold ETFs, click here."
2013-04-19,TGIF – 2 Tons of Physical Gold Snapped Up As Traders Panic,"63,500 ounces. That's how much physical gold the US Mint alone sold on Wednesday, as gold fell to $1,350. For the month, 147,000 ounces (4.5 tons) have been removed from the mint at a 20% discount to last year's $1,650 average price. Don't worry about the mint – they have an average purchase price of about $90 and the US has 8,000 tons of it sitting around so, if someone wants to buy $200M worth in a month – that's fine with us but consider that the guy(s) buying 4.5 tons of gold for $200M might not be stupid. We were discussing a great article in the Daily Bell (thanks Scott) that summed up my take on the recent gold move quite succinctly: Following the wikipedia.org definition, the PSYOPS war on gold is intended to influence the target audience's value system, belief system, emotions, motives, reasoning and behavior. I would add, especially this last, which is what directly affects the price of gold. The latest stage of the war began many weeks ago, with regular takedowns of the price of gold in waterfall fashion, at set times of the day. More recently, there appeared a series of planned announcements of oncoming doom from individuals prominent in finance and from bank analysts. The scenario painted for gold was one of a sky darkened by approaching thunderstorms. The purpose of the 4-12 PSYOPS was to instill fear in the minds of the target audience – investors in gold. If you shoot a crow, and hang it up in your field, the crows – your target audience – will avoid the field. The same principle applies to investors in gold. The identity of the target audience of the PSYOPS War on Gold is clearly revealed in the front-page article of the Financial Times, American edition, on Tuesday April … Would you like to read up-to-date articles on the day they are posted?

2013-05-07,Ominous Options Activity in Gold Miners ETF,"Shares of the downtrodden Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) are down 3.4 percent Tuesday, extending the ETF's 90-day loss to 33.6 percent, and some traders are betting things could get worse for GDX. Citing a note from Interactive Brokers, Barron's reports nearly 40,000 June $27 puts on GDX have changed hands today compared to open interest of 16,819 contracts. It looks like the bulk of the volume was purchased for an average premium of $0.89 per contract. Put buyers stand ready to profit at June expiration should the price of the underlying plunge 9.5%, according to the Interactive Brokers note. The note appeared in the Barron's Focus on Funds column in today's online edition. GDX was a holding at the end of the fourth quarter for hedge fund luminaries including David Einhorn and George Soros. That has not prevented the ETF from performing noticeably worse than gold itself. The last time GDX outperformed the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), which is backed by physical gold, on a yearly basis was 2010. In the past year while GLD is down 11.5 percent, GDX has plunged 34.2 percent. Options traders do not appear too enthused by the prospects for the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), either. Volume in the GDXJ June $12 puts is 720 contracts today compared to open interest of 867 contracts, according to Options Monster data. That ETF has lost almost 45 percent in the past year.

2013-05-17,"Four Things Einhorn, Soros Are Forgetting About Gold Miners ETF","Highlighting fourth-quarter 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was noted hedge fund legends David Einhorn and George Soros held sizable stakes in the largest gold miners ETF, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). To be fair to Soros, during the fourth quarter, he pared his stakes in GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) by 800,000 and 400,000 shares, but he still owned 1.5 million shares of GDX and about two million shares of GDXJ at the end of the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, Soros held 2.66 million shares of GDX, according to the latest 13F, meaning his stake in the ETF almost doubled. The filing also shows Soros still holds 1.2 million shares of GDXJ and initiated a new options position in that ETF. As for Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, that hedge fund still owns over 6 million shares of GDX. Either Einhorn and Soros know something about GDX and GDXJ that most of the rest of the world does not or they are forgetting the following. Average Returns Or shall we say disma? Ninety days ago, GDX was a $40 ETF. It will be lucky to close above $28 this week. Ninety days ago, GDXJ was a $17 ETF. It will be lucky to close above $11 this week.

2013-05-17,"4 Things Einhorn, Soros Are Forgetting About Gold Miners ETF","Highlighting fourth-quarter 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was noted hedge fund legends David Einhorn and George Soros held sizable stakes in the largest gold miners ETF, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). To be fair to Soros, during the fourth quarter, he pared his stakes in GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) by 800,000 and 400,000 shares, but he still owned 1.5 million shares of GDX and about two million shares of GDXJ at the end of the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, Soros held 2.66 million shares of GDX, according to the latest 13F, meaning his stake in the ETF almost doubled. The filing also shows Soros still holds 1.2 million shares of GDXJ and initiated a new options position in that ETF. As for Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, that hedge fund still owns over 6 million shares of GDX. Either Einhorn and Soros know something about GDX and GDXJ that most of the rest of the world does not or they are forgetting the following. Average Returns Or shall we say disma? Ninety days ago, GDX was a $40 ETF. It will be lucky to close above $28 this week. Ninety days ago, GDXJ was a $17 ETF. It will be lucky to close above $11 this week. In other words, the average return for the two ETFs in the past three months is a loss of about 33 percent. Ominous Options Activity Earlier this month, it was reported that options traders were stepping into the June GDX $27 puts in a big way. Problem is that put buying was not a one-off event.

2013-05-29,Mining Stocks Appear Cheap Versus Gold Bullion: Is Now the Time to Buy?,"The drop in the price of gold bullion has surprised many investors. With the level of monetary stimulus provided by the Federal Reserve and other central banks, many had believed that gold bullion would continue rising. The drop has not only impacted investors in gold bullion, but those in the associated mining stocks as well. While central banks have been buying gold bullion, investors in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have been selling a massive amount. The total amount sold by investors in ETFs is approximately 467 metric tons so far this year. At this point, mining stocks have become quite oversold in relation to the price of gold bullion, according to my analysis. There is the potential that this spread will narrow over time. It is true that gold bullion mining stocks face significant headwinds, specifically higher costs, but it appears much of this is now priced into the stocks. To combat the higher costs with the combination of lower gold bullion prices, many mining stocks are reducing production and cutting costs. The chart below shows the ratio between an index of gold bullion mining stocks (the Market Vectors Gold Miners) versus the price of gold bullion. This is not an indication on the direction, but a representation of the shift in valuation between mining stocks and gold bullion. Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com In the chart above, notice the area circled during the last part of 2008. At this point, the gold bullion mining stocks became extremely oversold versus the price of gold bullion itself. Since gold bullion and the mining stocks are closely correlated, a move to either extreme will tend to revert or bounce back. This is exactly what occurred, as the relationship between gold bullion and the mining stocks then reverted back to a more normalized level by the spring of 2009. Currently, the relationship between gold bullion and the mining stocks is once again becoming extremely stretched. This could potentially be a situation in which mining stocks close the gap between them and gold bullion. Of course, we are talking about correlation and not direction. This means that this spread can narrow, even if both gold bullion and the index of mining stocks continue dropping. My analysis simply indicates that if they both continue to fall, the index of mining stocks is closer to the bottom and will fall less in comparison to gold bullion. Conversely, they could both move up; if they did, my analysis again indicates that the index of mining stocks could outperform gold bullion. In the lower portion of the above chart showing the relationship between gold bullion and the mining stocks index is the price chart of the Market Vectors Gold Miners Index (NYSE: GDX) and gold bullion itself. The vertical lines correspond to points of extreme valuation and a more normalized level. From the fall of 2008 until the spring of 2009, gold bullion went from approximately $700.00 to $1,000 an ounce, a nice return of over 42%. However, mining stocks went from less than $20.00 to approximately $40.00, a return of over 100%. Note that I am not recommending simply buying mining stocks based on this cursory analysis. I am simply pointing out that this relationship is now at a fairly extreme level and has the possibility of narrowing. As I stated earlier, both gold bullion and the index of mining stocks might continue falling in price, yet this spread could narrow. They could also both begin rising. Perhaps this is an indication that much of the bad news is now priced into gold bullion mining stocks. In my experience, these types of stretched correlations tend to revert to the mean.

2013-07-15,The Tape Says Take Profits And Run When Mining ETF Bounces,"Some stocks, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) being a prime example, develop cult followings. Sometimes that is a good thing, but often times it is not. After all, members of a cult have, to put things delicately, given away their freedom of thought. Some ETFs accrue cult followings over time, too. Gold mining ETFs, such as the group's largest fund, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), have some impassioned shareholders. Confirming that is as simple as heading over to Twitter where, last week, a certain ETF analyst was on the receiving end of some choice words from gold mining bulls after those stocks spiked when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke implied quantitative easing tapering may not be as imminent as some previously thought. In this space, we've been bearish on gold mining ETFs for some time. One can timestamp that bearishness back to at least May 2012, when we wondered what happens to ETFs that slump back to their debut prices. Funds highlighted in that story include GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), a fund that was recently reverse split. RELATED: Four Things Einhorn, Soros Are Forgetting About Gold Miners ETF Since then, we have wondered aloud if things can actually get worse for mining ETFs. Then we proved that even really, really smart guys like David Einhorn, John Paulson and George Soros have struggled with mining stocks and ETFs. Overall, we have offered up plenty of analysis and coverage of what has generally been an awful time to hold mining ETFs for any more than a few days here and there. In the U.S., everyone is entitled to free speech, including giving other folks a hard time on Twitter. No problem at all, but here is a fact: GDX is down almost 43 percent since our piece questioning the validity of being long GDX and GDXJ was published on May 11, 2012. More importantly, this piece is not about being right. It is about what happens after GDX notches a good day or a few good days. Since those instants have been rare over the past year, the sample set is easy to establish. From September 12-14, 2012, GDX gained 7.6 percent. By October 15, the fund had lost 4.1 percent. Not too bad for an ETF this volatile, but there are other examples of GDX not being able to hold a few days of gains. From November 5-8, 2012, GDX gained about $2 to close at $51.41 on November 8. On November 15, the ETF closed below $46. From February 20-27, 2013 GDX traded modestly higher from $37.45 to $39.05. By April 17, the ETF had plunged to just over $27. May 17 through June 3 was a nice time to own GDX as the ETF went from $26.38 to $30.36. Holding the fund through June 22 was not wise as it dropped nearly 27 percent. However, by June 28, GDX was back to almost $24.50. By July 8, the ETF closed at $22.90. Bottom line: There very well could come time that gold miners rally and rally big-time. However, the tape proves that being long GDX and rival funds over the past 12-16 months has been difficult to say the least. Indeed, these ETFs have made for some good TRADES, but terrible long-term holds. Translation: If you catch five, six or seven percent in GDX or a comparable ETF in just a few days, do not wait and take something off the table. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-07-22,Gold Miners Explode,"Precious metals have been one of the worse performing sectors recently. Today that is not the case, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), and the iShares Silver Trust (ETF) (NYSE: SLV) are outperforming every major industry group on the day. The move higher comes as the U.S. Dollar Index futures decline on the session. It should also be noted that the USD/JPY is also falling and that weak currency pair also helps the precious metals to rally higher. Some of the gold and silver mining stocks that are rallying higher today include Yamana Gold Inc. (USA) (NYSE: AUY), Goldcorp Inc. (USA) (NYSE: GG), and Pan American Silver Corp. (USA) (NASDAQ: PAAS). Traders that want to track and trade the gold mining sector should follow the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Today, the GDX is trading higher by 6.23 percent at $27.48 a share. Short term day traders should watch for intra-day resistance around the $28.00 level. This industry group is showing tremendous intra-day relative strength today, so trying to fade this equity is going to be a tough endeavor. Traders should watch the USD/JPY, and the U.S. Dollar Index closely as the precious metals will generally trade inversely to the dollar. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"
2013-07-23,Put a RING on it With This ETF,"You might have heard that the good times for gold are back. At least temporarily. Bullion enjoyed its best intraday performance in over a year Monday, a move that was strong enough to put the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) within pennies of its 50-day moving average, something GLD has not traded above since early this year. Embattled gold miners are getting in on the act. Or maybe, for once, they are leading the way. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) now resides somewhat comfortably above its 50-day line. In the past month while GLD is up four percent, GDX gained 15.5 percent heading into the startof trading Tuesday. All that after gold miners had been maligned and at least five gold mining ETFs, including the popular Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT), were reverse split earlier this year. Should this rally gold miners rally be sustainable, investors may want to consider an ETF with RING). RING debuted at the end of January 2012 and is a direct competitor to GDX, the king of gold mining ETFs. The two have plenty similarities and that is nice way of saying that, until the past few weeks, both have been destroyers of capital as both down more than 40 percent year-to-date. Investors that bank on GDX are, whether they know it or not, are banking on Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Barrick (NYSE: ABX) as those stocks combine for 25 percent of that fund's weight. With RING, that number rises to 28 percent. A key difference between the two ETFs, in addition to the fact that RING has nine more holdings at 39 than GDX's 30, is that the latter offers some decent exposure to silver miners. Silver Wheaton (NYSE: SLW) is a top-10 holding in GDX while Cia de Minas Buenaventura (NYSE: BVN) receives a weight of 3.7 percent. Pan American Silver (NASDAQ: PAAS) is 2.2 percent of GDX's weight. Buenaventura is a RING holding, too, but overall that ETF is light on pure-play silver miners. In theory, the difference in silver miners allocations should make a noticeable difference in terms of performance between GDX and RING. Although silver miners have joined in on the precious metals mining resurgence with the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) surging 20 percent in the past month, that has not lead to a significant performance gap between GDX and RING. The edge goes to GDX, but the result is a gain of 15.54 percent to 15.45 percent for RING. Both funds are inexpensive on valuation with GDX sporting a price-to-book ratio of 0.95 at the end of June while RING's was 0.89. Deciding between the two is actually not difficult. GDX's average daily volume of over 26.1 million shares means it is the superior bet for active traders, but RING's 0.39 percent expense ratio (13 basis points cheaper than GDX's) indicates the fund is a credible option for those daring enough to make long-term bets on gold miners.

2013-07-24,"If Mining Rally is Legitimate, Don't Forget These ETFs","Traders appear to be taking some profits in gold miners and the corresponding ETFs Wednesday and that is not surprising. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and its small-cap counterpart, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are both down 3.2 percent. That might sound bad, but consider that since the start of July GDX was up almost 14 percent heading into Wednesday and GDXJ was up 19.6 percent. Some profit-taking was due to occur at some point. While the recent upside moves by various mining ETFs have been impressive, the track record for these funds and their constituents over the past 18 to 24 months has been ominous at best. That could mean some investors might need some more cajoling to truly embrace mining stocks and ETFs. Compelling valuations and the potential for a sustained rally in gold and silver prices are fundamental factors that could bode well for further upside for the miners. If that scenario comes to fruition, some obscure ETFs may be also be worthy of consideration. PureFunds ISE Junior Silver ETF (NYSE: SILJ) When it comes to silver mining ETFs, the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) is the dominant name, though that fund has a rival in the form of the iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SLVP). Over the past month, either SIL or SLVP made for a great choice as the two are up an average of about 23 percent. No one would quibble over returns like that, but the PureFunds ISE Junior Silver ETF has surged 27 percent over that time. Think of SILJ as the GDXJ of silver mining ETFs. Yes, there are some small-caps in SIL and SLVP, but the newly minted SILJ is the first pure-play ETF to exclusively hold silver explorers and junior silver producers, according to PureFunds. Silvercorp (NYSE: SVM) and Fortuna Silver (NYSE: FSM), SILJ's two largest holdings, have an average market cap of about $500 million. Those stocks combine for over 24 percent of the ETF's weight. IndexIQ Australia Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: KROO) Slowing economic growth in China, the looming end of the Australian mining boom and, yes, falling gold prices have been among the reasons Australia ETFs have disappointed this year. Now that gold prices are rebounding, so are Australia ETFs. The iShares MSCI Australia ETF (NYSE: EWA) is up 5.4 percent in the past month, but the better of playing Australia's status as one of the world's largest gold producers is with the IndexIQ Australia Small-Cap ETF. KROO has proven as much with a one-month gain of 12 percent. KROO has 22.8 percent weight to the materials sector, which is 450 basis points higher than EWA's exposure to the same sector. The small-cap fund also gives investors exposure to improvement in Australian economic data as consumer discretionary names account for over 26 percent of the fund's weight. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG) The Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF, a recent victim of a reverse split, has fought back to surge 22 percent in the past month. That is one of the best one-month run among mining ETFs, though hardly anyone has noticed because of GGGG's size (just $3.6 million in assets under management). On the surface, GGGG appears to be a copycat of GDX and the funds do share a few of the same holdings. However, GGGG is not heavily allocated to mining giants such as Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Barrick (NYSE: ABX) as GDX is. In fact, those stocks are not even found among GGGG's 23 holdings. The Global X offering has a heavy international bias as the U.S. receives a weight of just under five percent, the same as Kazakhstan. Canada, Australia and South Africa combine for about 70 percent of the ETF's country weight. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-07-26,Einhorn Letter Lifts These Two ETFs,"David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, the $8 billion hedge fund, released its second-quarter update to clients Friday and the poker-playing hedge fund manager's musings helped boost at least two ETFs. Shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) rallied closed near their highest levels of the day, up roughly one percent, after Einhorn confirmed that gold remains one of Greenlight's largest positions. Einhorn did not go into specifics, but Greenlight's first-quarter 13F filing showed the hedge fund had exposure to both individual mining and GDX. At the end of the first quarter, Greenlight owned over six million shares of GDX and nearly two million shares of Barrick (NYSE: ABX), according to the filing. Barrick is GDX's second-largest holding at 10.7 percent of the ETF's weight. Given that GDX is down over 41 percent year-to-date, it is not a stretch to say the trade has been a loser for Greenlight, but the firm's clients can find some comfort in knowing the ETF is up 23.5 percent in the past month. Related: Einhorn Could Have a Mining Problem. Shares of the Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF (NYSE: GREK) also closed near the highest levels of the session after Greenlight revealed medium-sized long positions in Alpha Bank and Piraeus Bank. Those stocks are GREK's fourth- and sixth-largest holdings, respectively, combining for 14.2 percent of the ETF's weight. What is interesting about the Greek bets is that Greenlight invested in an emerging market. That is exactly what Greece is classified as by not one, but two major index providers, MSCI (NYSE: MSCI) and Russell Investments. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-08-13,Chinese Gold Consumption May Fall Despite Surge,"Gold prices surged Monday when the China Gold Association announced that Chinese purchases rose by 54 percent for the first half of this year, compared to the same period last year. This comes after gold prices fell 32.5 percent from the commodity’s high last December ($1794.10) to its trough in June ($1211.60). “China bought a lot when prices fell below $1,350 in April thinking it will not fall further,” said Chen Min of Jinrui Futures. China purchased roughly 460 tonnes of gold for the first half of 2012 and 374 for the second half of the year. After buying more than 706 tonnes during the first half of 2013, investors need to consider the idea consumption for the second half of the year may slow or fall. Loading Up With prices so depressed during the first part of the year, Chinese purchases may have surged because people were buying for future use. According to The Telegraph, gold plays a crucial role in gift giving, weddings, and other ceremonies. It is very likely that Chinese citizens bought gold for these purposes with the intent of future use. Year over year demand was up 87 percent for bars and 44 percent for jewelry. Prices are Creeping Up Since gold bottomed out in June, the precious metal has risen more than eight percent, including a 5.4 percent jump in the past month. Simple supply and demand dictate that rising gold prices will cause demand to fall. This assumption is hard to make because Asian demand as a percentage of world demand has risen with rising gold prices (pushing prices even higher). Fear of Another Fall According to analyst Chen Min, Chinese purchasing accelerated near the $1350 level because investors did not think prices would fall further. Despite strong Asian buying, gold prices fell significantly below that level and are still fighting to regain it. Because they have been proven wrong, one can assume they will be more hesitant to buy gold when they think it is at a support level in the future. Gold rallied on Chinese bullishness and was trading at 1336.36 several hours after the stock market’s close. Gold miners were today’s big winners with the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) up 5.82 percent for the day."
2013-08-15,Two Leveraged ETFs For Rapid Near-Term Gains,"August is living up to its reputation as a tough month in which to be long stocks. With Thursday's 1.4 percent tumble, the S&P 500 is down more than three percent since the start of the month and nearly two percent in just the past five sessions. Related: Seasonal Trends: Three ETFs to Own in August. Eager bulls may find some comfort in knowing that August is half over, but they would do well to not get too cozy. In terms of performance, September is nothing to write home about. In fact, September is the worst month of the year for the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. Fortunately, there are a few leveraged ETFs investors can use over the coming weeks for rapid, and yes, large potential gains. The following duo looks especially promising. Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) No, that is not an error on your monitor. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares is really up more than 55 percent in just the past five days. NUGT is being reverse split 1-for-10 on August 20. If the ETF keeps its current pace up, it could be trading at $140, $150 or higher after the split. Reason to consider: The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the ETF NUGT is the triple-leveraged equivalent of, is not only soaring itself, but has also broken through important technical resistance that should encourage fresh buying. GDX could easily run another $5 before seeing its next legitimate resistance area. ProShares UltraShort Financials (NYSE: SKF) Financial services has been of the year's top-performing sectors. So strong have been banks, brokers and insurance providers that the sector is close to toppling technology for the largest sector weight in the S&P 500. The sector's previous success could make it ripe for a pullback and some recent, negative headlines pertaining to J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), one of the largest holdings in scores of bank ETFs, could prompt some near-term downside. Including SKF here is not a medium- or long-term bear call on financials, but it is hard to envision the sector remaining durable through a broader market pullback. SKF is close to moving above its 50-day moving average, which could stoke upside to the $24-$25 area.

Last month, it was revealed that the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index would begin including more American depositary receipts and global depositary receipts while barring companies with market values below $750 million. Related: If Mining Rally Is Legitimate, Don't Forget These ETFs. The NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index is a modified market capitalization-weighted index, and provides exposure to publicly traded companies worldwide involved primarily in gold mining, representing a diversified blend of small-, mid- and large- capitalization stocks, according to the GDX web page. GDX is the largest gold miners ETF with $6.4 billion in assets under management. Goldcorp (NYSE: GG), Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) are the ETF's top-three holdings and combine for about 35 percent of the fund's weight. Changes to the index are expected to take place after September 20. After reviewing the improved methodology, we are pleased with the planned changes and expect them to be beneficial for investors, said Brandon Rakszawski, product manager with Market Vectors, in a statement. By moving to allow for the inclusion of non-U.S. listed companies, we believe the Index will better capture the global nature of the gold mining industry. Additionally, by increasing the minimum market cap for inclusion in the Index, the overall liquidity of GDX holdings may be improved . Market Vectors also issues the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). GDXJ, which has $1.8 billion in AUM, is benchmarked to an in-house index. For more on ETFs, click here.

2013-09-16,A Look Ahead: This Week's ETFs To Watch,"It was just a few weeks ago that investors were put on red alert that a rough September was in the offing. That has not been the case this month as September's reputation for being a dreadful month for the bulls is nearly out the window, particularly after last week saw U.S. stocks notch their best weekly performance since January. Related: Three Bearish Leveraged ETFs For September. The S&P 500 climbed 1.5 percent while Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 2.5 percent on news Alcoa (NYSE: AA), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) will be replaced in the index by Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Visa (NYSE: V). More importantly, there is a Federal Reserve meeting this week and this is the big one. The one where the central bank could and probably should announce some form of tapering to its quantitative easing efforts. That will be the issue on traders' minds until clarity is delivered when the meeting concludes Thursday. Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST) Clearly, this is a trade for the adventurous because DUST is a volatile, triple-leveraged ETF. With a tapering announcement looming, bearish positions on precious metals make sense. The wind has come out of the recent rally in gold and silver ETFs and the miners are again being taken to task. Despite an impressive August rally, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) could not break through the $31-$32 area and make a run to reclaiming its 200-day moving average. That is one failure an the other is that GDX, which lost 8.5 percent just last week, have given back nearly all of its August gains. Bad news for those bullish on miners, but great news for DUST. PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio (NASDAQ: PNQI) Internet ETFs were in focus last week on news of the Twitter IPO, but there is a more important story to be heard with PNQI and rival funds. And yes, the story involves more than just the resurgence of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB). Internet ETFs, including PNQI, have been touching new all-time highs on a regular basis. The even better news is that these funds' fortunes are not intimately correlated to tapering, regardless of what the Fed does. In fact, Internet stocks and the ETFs that house them have proven relatively immune to rising interest rates, increasing the allure of this sub-sector in a post-tapering world. iShares MSCI China ETF (NYSE: MCHI) Scores of U.S.-focused ETFs have legacies of trade-worthy seasonality, but there is an interesting seasonal trend with China ETFs that has not gotten much attention. Over the last three years, select China ETFs have started rallies in mid- to late September that have lasted anywhere from into November, into year-end or into the following year. That is something to keep an eye on as emerging markets equities continue to perk up and investors embrace compelling valuations on Chinese shares. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-09-20,ETFs For A Post-Fed Decline,"With Friday's declines, major U.S. indices are close to giving back all of their post-Federal Reserve gains that were accrued Wednesday. Weakness in U.S. stocks after the Fed-induced, no tapering surge is not surprising. History shows that equities often hit a rough patch in the weeks immediately following a big Fed day and Wednesday certainly qualifies as that. Related: No Post-Fed Party For Insurance ETFs. Possibly making the near-term forecast for stocks all the more gloomy is October is right around the corner and the tenth month of the year is mediocre at best for the bulls. It is actually the worst month for the Russell 2000 and the fourth-worst month for the Nasdaq Composite. With October near and enthusiasm for the no tapering rally all but gone, traders may want to consider the following ETFs. Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST) DUST has been a champion for much of this year as gold's bull market appears to be ending. Yes, the yellow metal got some help from the Fed Wednesday, but in indication of just how week the miners are, DUST is following up a strong showing Thursday with a Friday gain of almost 19 percent at this writing. DUST's bullish outlook is confirmed by the fact that even when it rallied last month, the Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) was never able to to crack critical resistance at $31. Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: ERY) Talk about a post-Fed dud: The U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) is on pace to finish the week with a loss of about 1.5 percent. Bolstering the case for the Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X Shares is the fact that September is usually a good time to short oil stocks, but that has not been the case this month as the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) was up 3.6 percent heading into Friday's trading session. With Syria concerns all but extinct for the moment, a disappointing no tapering performance and seasonal trends at play, the energy sector is not a screaming buy at the moment. Perhaps the Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X Shares is for adventurous traders. ProShares UltraShort Financials (NYSE: SKF) SKF has an ugly chart, as do many leveraged bearish ETFs this year, but this fund has had some moments in the sun. There is risk with SKF because it is possible that large-cap banks will respond positively to falling interest rates, if that scenario occurs. However, there are reasons to believe SKF can go higher in the near-term. The fund is the double-leveraged, bearish answer to the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (NYSE: IYF). IYF has a six percent weight to J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), a company that generates more bad news than good these days. Additionally, IYF's exposure to regional banks and life insurance providers, albeit slight, is not a favorable trait if 10-year Treasury yields do decline in earnest. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-10-16,"ETF Outlook for October 16, 2013 (IPO, GDX, FXA)","Here are some notable ETFs worth taking a look at for Wednesday, October 16, 2013. Renaissance IPO ETF (NYSE: IPO) The second ETF to focus on recent public offerings will begin trading today under the symbol IPO. The ETF will track the Renaissance IPO Index and charge an expense ratio of 60 basis points. A direct competitor already in the market is the First Trust IPOX 100 Index ETF (NYSE: FPX). Surprisingly, FPX only has $81 million in assets even thought it has been around for about seven years. Investors have been missing out on a big winner because FPX has been able to triple the return of the S&P 500 during its history. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) A late day sell off yesterday due to the news of no deal in D.C. sent stocks lower and gold higher as money was flowing into the “safety” asset class. GDX closed the day up 2.8 percent and was one of the best performers in the market. Do not let Tuesday's rally hide the fact the ETF is down 49 percent in 2013 and was on the verge of testing a five-year low before the late day bounce. If and when a deal gets done it is likely the gold miners will continue to move lower with the price of gold. Rydex CurrencyShares Australian Dollar ETF (NYSE: FXA) The minutes from the October 1, Reserve Bank of Australia meeting were released yesterday and it showed that the central was open to more rate cuts, but that there was little urgency. FXA closed up 0.15 percent yesterday to the best level in four months on big volume. A lot of the action in the currency market is dependent on what happens with the U.S. debt issue, so expect increased volatility in the coming days. That being said, the chart of FXA is looking bullish on Tuesday's breakout."

2013-10-18,"ETF Outlook for October 18, 2013 (GDX, JNK, FDN, DXGE, GOOG)","Here are some notable ETFs worth taking a look at for Friday, October 18, 2013. WisdomTree Germany Hedged Equity ETF (NYSE: DXGE) The latest equity ETF to jump into the foreign currency-hedged arena began trading yesterday. The ETF with the most successful in the niche sector has been the WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (NYSE: DXJ) with $10.9 billion in assets. The question is whether investors are seeking an ETF with exposure to the German stock market while going short the euro. The db X-trackers MSCI Germany Hedged Equity ETF (NYSE: DBGR) has been around since May 2013 and has only accumulated $9.5 million in assets. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) A 5.2 percent surge yesterday was the result of gold gaining $40/ounce after the debt deal was announced. Contrary to what many believed, the deal was actually positive for gold because all the politicians in DC did was kick the can down the alley until February. More importantly it handcuffs the Fed until a long-term deal is agreed upon and we all know that will not take place before the first week of February. There is also speculation that GDX was the recipient of short covering considering the ETF was down 50 percent heading into yesterday. SPDR High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE: JNK) For the same reason gold increase, Treasuries also caught a bid yesterday as investors bet the Fed will not begin to taper anytime in the near future. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 2.58 percent, the lowest close in two months. The junk bonds are again moving higher with JNK gaining 0.5 percent yesterday and closing at the best level in nearly three months. If the Fed sits on its hand for a few months and stocks move higher, the winner in the bond market will be the high yield corporate bonds and JNK. The yield on JNK is an attractive 5.5 percent. First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index ETF (NYSE: FDN) One of the few losers yesterday should regain its mojo after its top holding blew earnings estimates out of the water last night. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) saws its third quarter earnings increase by 36 percent, besting what the street was looking for and the stock immediately jumped $63/share to a new all-time high. The stock makes up 10 percent of FDN and should be enough to boost its peers and the ETF. A close above $54.78 would be a breakout to a new high and the resistance level to watch for the ETF."
2013-10-26,"Top ETFs of the Week (GDX, EPOL, NUGT, URA)","The top ETFs in several categories this week are listed below. Sector ETF – Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) The ETF closed out the week with a gain of 8.0 percent and is trading at the best level in a month. This has not been a good year for the gold miners, but the recent pattern suggests there could be more short-term upside for the ETF. Longer-term the severe downtrend remains intact and the ETF is a gamble as investors would be fighting the trend. A major reason for the big move this week was a 24 percent gain from the number 11 holding, Agnico-Eagle Mines (NYSE: AEM). Country ETF – iShares MSCI Poland ETF (NYSE: EPOL) The ETF closed at a new two-year high after gaining 3.8 percent this week. The last few months have been good to the ETF after a rough start to the year. A six-month downtrend was broken in July and after a big move to new highs, the ETF is up eight percent in 2013. The risk remains high for investors in Poland and the longer-term trend on the ETF is not overly attractive. There are better options in the emerging market arena. Leveraged ETF – Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3x ETF (NYSE: NUGT) The big move in the mining stocks sent this extremely risky ETF up 23.9 percent on the week. To put this into perspective, the ETF is still down 90 percent in 2013 after the big really the last week. Similar to GDX, the move this week was based on a rising price for gold and a big breakout by AEM. Any leveraged ETF is capable of a big week when the tide is moving in their favor, at the same time an investor can have the waves crash on them if they are on the wrong side of the trade. For example, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3x ETF (NYSE: JDST) lost 33 percent this week because it is a bet on the small-cap gold miners falling and that was not the case. Investors, beware! Niche ETF – Global X Uranium ETF (NYSE: URA) A six percent rally on Friday made up the majority of the 6.3 percent weekly gain for the uranium ETF. This is a tough one to figure out because the top stocks in the ETF did not make the big moves to account for a six percent gain on Friday, but the action was confirmed through several sources. The one very interesting difference on Friday was the volume for URA, which was eight times more than the average daily volume for the ETF. The ETF is worth watching, but do not jump into this bizarre situation at this time."
2013-10-29,Why Investors Shouldn't Lose Interest in Gold Producers,"By Moe Zulfiqar No one is talking about gold producers these days. The reason behind this is both simple and apparent: gold bullion prices have declined. As a result, gold producers are facing pressures. Pessimism towards gold producers is very high; some are even calling them the worst investment to hold in your portfolio. Just look at the chart below of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the performance of well-known gold producers. This ETF has lost more than half of its value since 2012, with a majority of the losses coming in 2013. So why would an investor want to buy this ETF? After all, no one wants to catch a falling knife. Well, the drop in gold bullion prices has caused a significant amount of damage to the gold producers. That said, I wouldn’t call them the worst investment—though I am slightly pessimistic about their movement in the short term—and continue to be bullish in the long run. Chart courtesy of www.Stockcharts.com You see, in the short run, companies producing gold bullion or looking for the metal have to make a lot of changes. These changes range from deciding on what kind of reserves in the ground they should exploit to how much they should produce. Gold producers, in the short term, have to make decisions on what to do with their expensive operations, how to cut costs, and how to build up cash positions. While we are already seeing this happen, I believe more is needed. The reason I remain bullish on gold producers is because I am bullish on the shiny yellow metal. My reasoning behind this is very simple: gold producers actually provide leverage returns to the gold bullion prices. For example, if an investor owned gold bullion, and prices went from $1,300 to $2,000, this would equate to a profit of about 54%. Now, if a gold producer is able to extract the precious metal from the ground at $800.00 an ounce at a sell price of $1,300, the company’s profits would be $500.00 per ounce. At a price of $2,000, its profits would increase to $1,200 an ounce, or 140%. And the stock price would reflect this. Those who are looking for opportunities in the gold mining sector have to be very careful about what they buy. The first step they should take is to do extensive research on the companies they think are good contenders, making sure about their costs. At the same time, investors also have to make sure that the company’s management is willing to work and take action. Investors who already own gold producers and are not seeing much change in their position should consider taking some losses and looking for other companies if they are fixated on having exposure to the sector.

2013-11-06,Declining Sector Set to Outperform Stock Market,"When it comes to the recent batch of corporate earnings releases, some investors might be cheering. But if you look a bit closer at the results, you will notice the underlying fundamentals aren’t as strong as they first appear. One thing to remember: in the equities market, it’s all about expectations. A company might report corporate earnings of $100 million, but if analysts in the equities market were expecting $150 million, the results would actually be disappointing. The reason for this is that the equities market is a discounting mechanism for future corporate earnings. Analysts and investors estimate what the next 12–24 months might bring in terms of corporate earnings and accordingly adjust their valuations for various stocks in the equities market. What’s interesting to note in this corporate earnings season so far is that the spread between actual and estimated corporate earnings is declining. This means companies are having difficulty exceeding expectations. Also Read: NYSE Holidays 2014 So far, 244 of the S&P 500 companies have reported corporate earnings, and while 75% have beaten corporate earnings estimates, on average, they have only exceeded these expectations by 0.8%. The four-year average is 6.5%. (Source: FactSet, October 25, 2013.) And if you listen to executives at various companies within the equities market, you will notice another common theme: companies are having difficulty finding and generating revenue growth. Of the S&P 500 firms in the equities market that have reported corporate earnings so far, only 52% have exceeded revenue estimates—far below the four-year average of 59%. This is why they are issuing dividends and buying back shares; they can’t figure out a better way to invest the firm’s money (which is really yours as a shareholder) and drive revenue. Simply put, much of the initial push up in corporate earnings that drove the equities market was due to cost-cutting and a significant amount of share buybacks. But cost-cutting can only go so far; we all know that. And while there is nothing wrong with share buybacks, especially when stocks are selling at a discount, with the current level of the equities market, companies are actually paying a premium for their shares at this point, which will not be beneficial to shareholders in the long run. Doesn’t really sound like a bullish scenario over the next year, does it? Over the long term, investing in the equities market is all about re-allocation of your portfolio; that means buying stocks in sectors when expectations are low and selling stocks in sectors when expectations have gotten too high. With the equities market at all-time highs, many sectors are now pricing in very high expectations for corporate earnings growth over the next year. I think this leaves little room to the upside, but potentially large risks to the downside. Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com This chart shows the equities market represented by the S&P 500 (black line) versus the Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) exchange-traded fund (ETF). As you can see, they have moved in opposite directions over the past couple years. While the broad equities market has soared to new highs, mining stocks are near their lows. It’s pretty obvious that expectations are significantly higher for the overall equities market versus mining stocks. But this is where I believe a long-term investor can take advantage of such a divergence in expectations. It is true that mining stocks in general have suffered from the drop in commodity prices, which have hit their corporate earnings. As a result, mining stocks are now pricing in very low expectation levels. This means that any marginal improvement in corporate earnings would dramatically shift investors’ outlook for the future and result in higher stock price levels for this sector. For the long-term investor, you don’t want to be part of the herd. You want to buy when others are selling, and sell when others are buying. For me, as a long-term investor, I think mining stocks look attractive. This article Declining Sector Set to Outperform Stock Market was originally published at Investment Contrarians"
2013-11-13,"ETF Outlook for Wednesday November 13, 2013 (GLD, FXY, PGAL, GXG)","ETF Outlook for the Wednesday, November 13, 2013 SPDR Gold ETF (NYSE: GLD) Comments from several Fed Presidents today had the market on the defensive after it appeared tapering is on the table at the December meeting. With the jobs picture still cloudy that does not appear to likely, however when a Fed President speaks, the market listens. As the taper concerns spread through the market it held back stocks, but the real damage was it the commodities market. Oil fell to the lowest level in months and gold is closing in on a multi-month low. GLD closed down by 1.15 percent at its lowest closing price in 4 months. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) fared even worse, with a loss of 2.1 percent and the ETF is now down 49 percent for the year. On the flip side there is the DB Short Gold ETN (NYSE: DGZ), which closed up 1.2 percent and matched its best intraday high in 4 months. The path of least resistance for gold is down and this is one asset class to avoid at this time. Rydex CurrencyShares Japanese Yen ETF (NYSE: FXY) A perfect storm for a weak Yen could be brewing again. If the Fed decides to taper in December it will boost the value of the U.S. Dollar, thus putting pressure on foreign currencies such as the Yen. The latest reports out of Japan have not been great and this is another negative for the country’s currency. Finally you have PM Abe who has stated his intentions to lower the value of the Yen to fight deflation. Put this all together and you have FXY at a new 2-month low yesterday. The ETF closed at $98.03 and if it cannot hold $97.38 it could continue to fall and retest the 2013 low of $94.38. As the Yen fall the ProShares UltraShort Yen ETF (NYSE: YCS) breaks out to a multi-month high. The two-times inverse leveraged ETF will do the opposite of the Yen on a daily basis, multiplied by two. This is an aggressive play, but could be a winner for traders if the perfect storm his the country of the rising sun. Global X FTSE Portugal 20 ETF (NYSE: PGAL) The first ETF concentrating solely on Portugal will begin trading today under the symbol PGAL. The ETF is made up of 20 stocks that trade on the NYSE Euronext Lisbon exchange. Global X filed for this ETF nearly two and a half years ago and it have finally come to fruition. The country’s stock market is up 15 percent this year and up over 40 percent since it hit a low in the summer of 2012. Now investors can own all the PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain) via ETFs; Portugal was the lone country without its own ETF. If the turnaround story in Europe continues it could see PGAL attracted decent assets in the next year. Global X InterBolsa FTSE Colombia 20 ETF (NYSE: GXG) Not an obscure ETF, but definitely one that is not on the top of many investors wishlist is GXG. The reason it is mentioned here this morning is because it is working on a 12-day losing streak. The ETF has not had an up day since 10/25. In that time GXG has lost 10.7 percent and is trading at the worst level since July. Last week the country said it is looking for GDP growth of 3-5 percent in 2014, which is not too shabby with the current slow growth world economy. However, the country has its own issues it is dealing with that stretch from geopolitical uncertainty to a debt issue that is expanding rapidly. The reward is not the risk at current prices, but there could be a time in the future that investors take a change on Pablo Escobar’s birthplace."
2013-11-14,Cave-In Protection For Gold Miner Longs,"Two Years Of Gold Bugs Getting Burned In an article last week (Gold: A Sucker's Paradise), ETFguide editor Ron DeLegge noted the illustrious list of hedge fund managers who have gotten burned over the last two years being long gold and related securities such as the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE: GLD). One hedge fund manager who's been on the right side of the gold trade has been Tim Knight, who mentioned on Tuesday that GLD was his largest short position (Repeating My Target for GLD). GLD is down about 30% over the last two years, but gold miners have done even worse. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down more than 60% over the same time frame. Nevertheless, GDX closed up fractionally on Wednesday, and the triple-levered mining ETF Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bullish 3x Shares (NYSE: NUGT) closed up 1.05%. In this post, we'll look at a way the brave souls buying NUGT can get paid to limit their downside risk. 1) Hedging With Optimal Puts Uncapped upside, but unavailable in this case. As of Wednesday's close, it was too expensive to hedge NUGT against a greater-than-20% drop over the next several months with optimal puts* (i.e., taking into account the cost of the put protection, it wasn't possible to limit your losses to no greater than 20%). This is pretty common with triple-leveraged ETFs, as the volatility means higher options premiums. Because of that, we were presented with the error message above. 2) Hedging With An Optimal Collar Pays you to hedge. 20% upside cap. If you were willing to cap your potential upside at 20% between now and June 20th, this was the optimal collar** to hedge 1000 shares of NUGT against a greater-than-20% drop over the same time frame. As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the net cost of this collar, as a percentage of position value, was negative, meaning you would get paid to hedge. The high premiums on the short call leg more than offset the high premiums on the long put leg of this collar. Note that, to be conservative, Portfolio Armor calculated the cost of this hedge by using the bid price of the call leg and the ask price of the put leg. In practice, you can often sell calls for more (at some price between the bid and ask) and buy puts for less (again, at some price between the bid and ask), so, in actuality, an investor opening the optimal collar above may have paid less than $2900 to hedge in this case. Possibly More Protection Than Promised In some cases, hedges such as the ones above can provide more protection than promised. For a recent example of that, see this post about hedging shares of Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA). *Optimal puts are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest possible cost. Portfolio Armor uses an algorithm developed by a finance PhD to sort through and analyze all of the available puts for your stocks and ETFs, scanning for the optimal ones. **Optimal collars are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest net cost, while not limiting your potential upside by more than you specify. The algorithm to scan for optimal collars was developed in conjunction with a post-doctoral fellow in the financial engineering department at Princeton University. The screen captures above come from the Portfolio Armor iOS app."
2013-11-26,"Where is the Bottom for Gold Miners? (GDX, GDXJ, DUST, JDST)","After a decade of gains for the gold, the precious metal is setting up for its second consecutive negative year. The SPDR Gold ETF (NYSE: GLD) is down 26 percent year to date and yesterday traded at the lowest level since July. While the losses for GLD look bad considering the gains in equities, the gold mining stocks are taking an even bigger beating. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is hitting a new five-year low and is now down 53 percent in 2013. The looming question evolves around where the bottom is for the mining stocks. Related: Gold Ends Week Below $1,300 as it searches for a Bottom The sector has been attempting to cut costs as the price of gold has fallen to levels that are troubling for the miners. According to Goldman Sachs, most miners can deal with $1,300/ounce gold prices, but any further drops would lead to mine closures and other means of cutting costs. With gold currently trading near $1,245/ounce it is putting pressure on the miners to either make drastic cost cutting measures or lose money on some of their mines. The smaller gold mining companies, referred to as the juniors, are in an even more precarious situation. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is down 60 percent this year and trading at a new low. Inverse Gold Miner ETFs There are a few ETFs that move in the inverse direction of the gold miners and they have been big winners the last few months. The most heavily traded of the group is the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3x ETN (NYSE: DUST). The ETN will move three times the inverse of the underlying index on a daily basis. In the last month the ETN is up 69 percent. For the year DUST has a gain of 186 percent. A new ETN in the mix is the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bear 3x ETN (NYSE: JDST). In the last month the ETN is up 105 percent and is trading at a new high. Related: 3 Reasons Family Offices Should Invest in Gold The unfortunately problem with the two inverse ETNs is that they are highly leveraged (three times) products.

In an ideal world there would be a vehicle that would offer an inverse option for the gold miners that did not involve leverage. There is no such product available at this time for traders. Therefore, the best strategy is to stay far away from the gold miners until the free fall is over and the landscape has changed for the sector."

2013-12-03,"ETF Outlook for Tuesday, December 3, 2013","ETF Outlook for Tuesday, December 3, 2013 Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) The price of gold continues to fall as it closed at the lowest level since July. The SPDR Gold ETF (NYSE: GLD) finished yesterday down by 2.4 percent as the allure of the precious metal is disappearing quickly. See also: Matt McCall's Interview on PreMarket Info The gold miners have been hit even harder as GDX fell to the lowest level in five years yesterday. The ETF is now down 55 percent in 2013 after falling 6 percent yesterday. Investors unwilling to give up on gold as a long-term investment better be hoping for the metal to hold the July lows. A breach of the July lows could send down to the $1,000/ounce level in the coming months. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index ETF (NYSE: EEM) The emerging market stocks have been attempting to rally into the end of the year to salvage one of its worst years of the last decade. Monday was not a good start for the sector as EEM fell 2.1 percent to close at a new two-week low. Good economic news out of the U.S. could leader to a Fed taper sooner rather than later, which is viewed as a negative for the emerging markets. Other interest rate sensitive sectors also traded lower as interest rates increased. iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSE: TLT) The rise in the interest rates across the board had fixed income ETFs on the defensive on Monday. Strong economic data could put pressure on the Fed to begin tapering sooner rather than later and inevitably pushing bond prices lower and interest rates higher. See also: Amazon, Drones & ETFs (AMZN, ROBO, AVAV, ITA, BA, ESLT) TLT, which is composed of long-date U.S. Treasuries lost 1.1 percent on Monday and is not far from closing at the lowest level since the third quarter of 2011.

2014-01-14,"ETF Outlook For Tuesday, January 14, 2014 (GDX, PBS, SPY, EGPT)","ETF Outlook for Tuesday, January 14, 2014 SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) The market suffered its worst day of 2014 yesterday with SPY falling by 1.34 percent to the lowest level since the December 20. The one-day drop was the largest since late September for the ETF. The selloff came on heavy volume as all 10 S&P sectors were lower. A combination of a negative call from Goldman Sachs regarding equity valuations and comments from a Fed president led to investors taking profits. Technically the attention turns to the 50-day moving average, which has been a support zone several times over the last year. The indicator is currently at $180.27 and the ETF closed today at $181.68. The other level of support to watch is at the $177 area. PowerShares Dynamic Media ETF (NYSE: PBS) Two big names in the cable industry were moving higher after the bell yesterday when Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR) made a buyout offer for Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC) at $132.50/share. See also: ETFs Poised For Apple Rally (AAPL, IYW, XLK, QQQ, GOOG, MSFT) The news was not a major surprise and either was the response from TWC rejecting the deal immediately. Both stocks have been moving sideways recently as PBS has been pulling back with the overall market from an all-time high. The possibility of consolidation in the cable sector is extremely high and with PBS heavily concentrated in the sector it will be a mover on any news. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) One of the only sectors to close in positive territory yesterday was the niche ETF that focuses on gold mining stocks. GDX finished higher by 2.9 percent and closed at the best level since November. The close at $22.65 was the first time the ETF closed above the 50-day moving average since October when the ETF achieved the feat before continuing the downtrend to a multi-year low. If the ETF can continue to close above $22 for a few days it will signify a breakout that must be watched and respected. Market Vectors Egypt ETF (NYSE: EGPT) The Egyptian EGX 30 Index, which tracks the 30 largest and most liquid stocks in Egypt, closed up two percent yesterday to the best level in just under three years. Considering what the country has been through and is still dealing with it is a surprise to see money flowing into the country.

The breakout yesterday was on heavy volume and was a bullish longer-term signal."
2014-01-14,"ETF Outlook for Tuesday January 14, 2014 (GDX, PBS, SPY, EGPT)","ETF Outlook for Tuesday January 14, 2014 SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) The market suffered its worst day of 2014 yesterday with SPY falling by 1.34 percent to the lowest level since the 20th of December. The one-day drop was the largest since late September for the ETF. The selloff came on heavy volume as all 10 S&P sectors were lower. A combination of a negative call from Goldman Sachs regarding equity valuations and comments from a Fed president led to investors taking profits. Technically the attention turns to the 50-day moving average, which has been a support zone several times over the last year. The indicator is currently at $180.27 and the ETF closed today at $181.68. The other level of support to watch is at the $177 area. PowerShares Dynamic Media ETF (NYSE: PBS) Two big names in the cable industry were moving higher after the bell yesterday when Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR) made a buyout offer for Time Warner Cable (NYSE: TWC) at $132.50/share. The news was not a major surprise and either was the response from TWC rejecting the deal immediately. Both stocks have been moving sideways recently as PBS has been pulling back with the overall market from an all-time high. The possibility of consolidation in the cable sector is extremely high and with PBS heavily concentrated in the sector it will be a mover on any news. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) One of the only sectors to close in positive territory yesterday was the niche ETF that focuses on gold mining stocks. GDX finished higher by 2.9 percent and closed at the best level since November. The close at $22.65 was the first time the ETF closed above the 50-day moving average since October when the ETF achieved the feat before continuing the downtrend to a multi-year low. If the ETF can continue to close above $22 for a few days it will signify a breakout that must be watched and respected. Market Vectors Egypt ETF (NYSE: EGPT) The Egyptian EGX 30 Index, which tracks the 30 largest and most liquid stocks in Egypt, closed up 2 percent yesterday to the best level in just under three years. Considering what the country has been through and is still dealing with it is a surprise to see money flowing into the country. On the flip side, the country does have natural resources and is the third largest economy in Africa. EGPT closed yesterday higher by 2.2 percent, its best level in 14 months. The breakout yesterday was on heavy volume and was a bullish longer-term signal."
2014-01-15,How to Profit Big from Gold Mining Stocks Left for Dead,"Left for dead: that’s what appears to be what most investors have done to gold mining stocks. With the price of gold bullion down significantly in 2013, it appears many are simply ignoring all gold mining stocks, lumping them into one category and avoiding the group as a whole. Personally, I love buying when things are on sale. I hate paying full price on anything, no matter if it is for a stock or clothes. When it comes to gold mining stocks, the market sentiment hasn’t been this bearish in years. Also Read: NYSE 2014–2016 Holidays Schedule Market sentiment tends to oscillate, and for the long-term investor, one should be looking to buy when others are selling and looking to sell when others are buying. Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com The above chart shows the price of gold bullion (black line) on top of the price of gold mining stocks (red line) as exhibited through the exchange-traded fund (ETF) Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). As you can tell from the chart, gold mining stocks are close to reaching lows not seen since the fall of 2008. While there are some gold mining stocks in financial difficulty due to their high cost of production, there are certainly some companies that are extremely attractive, considering how much bad news is priced into the market. This is what you have to consider as an investor: is market sentiment too bullish, too bearish, or somewhere in between? I believe that both gold bullion and gold mining stocks look attractive at this point because most of the bad news has already been priced into the market. Because the price of gold bullion still remains depressed, those companies that can’t operate in this environment will suffer. However, there are gold mining stocks that are able to produce at an all-in sustaining cost that is below the current price of gold bullion, which means they remain profitable. If a company still has strong assets, a solid balance sheet, and is able to create positive cash flow, this type of firm is of interest to me, especially when market sentiment is so negative. One such company investors may want to consider is Primero Mining Corp. (NYSE: PPP). As a group, I believe gold mining stocks have significant potential to move up over the next few years because of fundamental changes to their business model. Because the price of gold bullion has dropped, companies have changed their approach. When gold bullion was rising sharply, gold mining stocks were expanding at a rapid rate. Companies were taking on projects that were barely profitable, simply for the sake of expanding. However, the focus for gold mining stocks these days is on efficiency and cost-cutting. Many properties are now sitting idle and expansion plans have been put on hold. This means that we will see less supply growth of actual gold bullion onto the market. With physical gold bullion demand still remaining strong, at some point, the fundamental backdrop will take hold. You can’t have lower supply and strong demand without an eventual rise in price. In addition, easy money by central banks around the world continues to flow, and this, too, will ultimately have a positive impact on the price of gold bullion. I think that when we look back in a few years, many investors will wish they had added some gold mining stocks to their diversified portfolio. The market is cyclical, and for long-term investors, focusing on adding sectors when they are weak and taking profits in sectors when they are strong is usually a recipe for success.

2014-01-23,Gold: Slam-Dunk Sell or Trade of the Year?,"Demand for gold bullion remains high. Each day there’s a new piece of information that continues to attest to this phenomenon. With this, I remain bullish on the yellow shiny metal. But one thing should be noted: I am not saying the bottom has been placed in, but that all the indicators are suggesting a bottom may be in the making. From a fundamental point of view, the basic factors of price—supply and demand—suggest gold prices may be going higher (which I have said before). Demand is increasing. We are seeing massive demand for gold bullion from countries like Turkey. According to the Istanbul Gold Exchange, Turkey imported 302.3 tons of gold bullion in 2013. This was more than double what it imported in 2012 and the highest amount since 1995. (Source: Larkin, N., “Turkey’s Silver Imports Surge to Most Since 1999 as Prices Slide,” Bloomberg, January 2, 2014.) Also Read: NYSE holidays 2014 Pakistan is seeing massive imports of gold bullion into the country. As a result, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet has imposed a ban of 30 days on gold bullion imports to Pakistan. This is the second time the country has taken such a step. The first time it imposed a ban on gold bullion imports was in July of 2013. (Source: “ECC imposes 30-day ban on gold import,” The Nation, January 21, 2014.) The demand for gold bullion from India and China has shown great resilience in the past year, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it continue. With the Chinese New Year fast approaching—a time when gold bullion is purchased by consumers as gift and good luck—we should soon have a better idea of how it will look for the precious metal this year. From a technical point of view, we are seeing a continuous battle in gold prices, but they fail to break below the lows made last year. Every time gold prices reach those levels, we see a rush of buyers come in and take it higher, as you can see in the following chart of daily gold prices (pay close attention to the circled areas). Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com As all of this happens, I continue to see value in gold bullion producers. Some of the well-known, low-cost producers are selling for extremely low prices. They are being punished for all the wrong reasons, in my opinion. For investors who want to profit from this, you may want to consider an exchange-traded fund (ETF) like Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX).

2014-01-29,Top Investor Safe Havens for Protection Against Collapsing Economic Growth,"Troubles in the global economy look to be strengthening, suggesting an economic slowdown may be following. Not only are the major economic hubs of the global economy showing signs of stress—something I have mentioned in these pages many times before—but we see demand slowing down as well. The Baltic Dry Index (BDI) gives us a general idea about how the demand in the global economy looks. At the very core, this index tracks the shipping price of raw materials. If the shipping prices increase, it suggests there’s increased demand in the global economy. If it declines, it’s not really a good sign. Please look at the chart of the BDI below. Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com The BDI is outright collapsing. Since the beginning of the year, the BDI has declined more than 42%. This shouldn’t be taken lightly because it suggests demand in the global economy is slowing down very quickly. Looking at the average change in BDI in January since 2003, this decline in 2014 is the second-biggest on record—in 2012, the BDI collapsed 58% in January. Also Read: NYSE holidays 2014 Another indicator of demand in the global economy I look at is the Chinese economy. It has been known as the manufacturing hub of the world, and the country exports a significant amount of its goods to the world. If we see manufacturing activity in that country slow down, it gives us a hint that a global economic slowdown may be following. Consider this: In January, the HSBC Flash China Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI)—an indicator of manufacturing activity in China—plunged to a six-month low. It was registered at 49.6 in January compared to 50.5 in December. (Source: “HSBC Flash China Manufacturing PMI,” Markit, January 23, 2014.) Any reading on the PMI below 50 signals a contraction in the manufacturing sector. It showed new export orders decreasing at a faster rate in January, too. What does this mean for American investors? If the global economy does cave under these pressures and we see an economic slowdown, then it wouldn’t be a surprise to see the equity markets in the countries where troubles are brewing come down a little further. Those markets may not be a smart buy now—but if they decline, they might create some opportunities. In the meantime, as this situation develops, investors may seek out a hedge against uncertainty, such as gold stocks, which have been the best-performing sector so far this year. One way investors can use gold to hedge against uncertainty may be through an exchange-traded fund (ETF), such as Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX).

2014-02-12,Gold and U.S. Bonds the New Great Trade?,"There’s uncertainty on the stock market. Troubles are coming from the emerging markets, and they are causing investors to panic and sell their stocks. We see they are scared. But as this is happening, there’s a trade in the making, and those investors who have raised some cash (as I’ve been suggesting my readers do) and are looking to park their money somewhere safer than stocks can profit from this opportunity. The trade I’m talking about is the trade that’s happening in U.S. bonds and gold bullion—some call this phenomenon a “flight to safety.” I call it a potential opportunity. Also Read: NYSE holidays 2014 We know bonds and gold bullion are one of those asset classes where investors rush to when the risks on the stock market increase. This is something we are seeing now, and it could continue for some time. In the following chart, I have plotted the prices of U.S. bonds (red line), gold bullion (black line), and the S&P 500 (green line). Take a look at the circled area, which shows the movement out of stocks. Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com Since the beginning of the year, U.S. bonds and gold bullion prices have increased in value, while the stocks have fallen. We have seen this relationship before as well. A prime example of this is the stock market sell-off in 2009; we saw investors rush to gold bullion and bonds then in hopes of finding safety. It’s not too late for investors to consider taking advantage of this shift by looking at exchange-traded funds (ETFs), like iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NYSE: TLT). Through this ETF, investors can invest in long-term U.S. bonds and profit as their prices appreciate. They may also look into ETFs like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) to take advantage of the rise in gold bullion prices. If investors want leveraged returns from gold bullion prices, they may want to take a look at Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). This ETF tracks the performance of companies that produce gold bullion. Why do I say it isn’t too late for investors to profit? Because I believe this flight to safety from stocks to U.S. bonds and gold bullion will continue. The main reason I expect this to continue is because there isn’t really a clear direction as to where the global economy, especially the emerging markets, are headed next. For example, the emerging markets are still in a debacle since the Federal Reserve started to taper its quantitative easing. Back when the monetary easing started, the trade was to borrow from the U.S. and go invest in the emerging markets. This flood of money created troubles, and now there are questions about whether it can come back without causing damage. We have seen currencies of emerging markets deteriorate very quickly, including the Turkish lira, South African rand, and Russian ruble, just to name a few. So as the Fed tapers, these problems could grow, sending more stock market investors to the exits. Remember, dear reader, that proper portfolio management goes a long way. You have to keep in mind that things can change very quickly, and this trade that’s currently in the making can vanish into thin air. Manage your risks through ETFs and portfolio diversification, and don’t overexpose your portfolio to just one asset class.

2014-02-14,Why I Recently Turned Bullish on Gold Mining Stocks,"A friend of mine asked me the other day about the best way to build a long-term investment strategy. This is a great question, but it’s also one of the most difficult ones to answer. Obviously, different people have various goals and objectives, especially when it comes to risks. For me, the way I put together an investment strategy is by looking to buy things when they are on sale, including stocks. Over the past couple of months, if you’ve been following my articles, you’ve likely noticed that I’ve started to become quite bullish on gold mining stocks. This is the classic investment strategy of buying when most people are selling. When you consider the current sentiment, it’s clear that gold mining stocks haven’t experienced this much negativity in years. Also Read: NYSE holidays 2014 Of course, you can’t simply have an investment strategy to buy any random stock or sector when it goes down; that’s doomed to fail. At some point, for the investment strategy to work, there must be some fundamental strength over the long term. We all know about the pain felt by most gold mining stocks. But don’t forget: the market is a forward-looking mechanism. Your investment strategy should not focus on what’s happening today, but what is likely to occur over the next several quarters and even years. Why did I recently become bullish on gold mining stocks? I believe part of the reason for the significant weakness in the precious metal, especially in December, was due to institutions continuing to play the trends. You have to remember that large funds are measured by their performance (yearly and quarterly), and with a strong 2013, very few institutions would initiate an investment strategy of buying gold mining stocks right before year-end, as this could hurt their bonuses. Over the last few months, we have also seen a large number of gold mining stocks write off bad investments and reduce expansion plans. This has naturally hurt the financial situation over the short term, but I believe most of the bad news has now been priced into the market. When the stock market bottomed in March of 2009, it was a great time to buy, even though this was a very difficult investment strategy because of all the negativity around the state of the economy at that point. I think gold mining stocks are currently being met with a similar barrage of negativity, which is certainly warranted, considering the state of their businesses. But as we all know, the business cycle oscillates, and I think gold mining stocks are now at a point where they have written off most of the bad assets and the stocks are pricing in a terrible environment. I’m considering gold mining stocks because very few investors are talking about an investment strategy in this sector, and I think there is the potential for a rise in the price of precious metals in 2014. Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com Above is a chart of the gold mining stocks exchange-traded fund the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Since gold mining stocks bottomed out in December 2013, the index has quickly moved up to the 200-day moving average. As I noted earlier, the investment strategy to accumulate at the end of 2013 was correct, as large institutions stayed out of the market. With gold mining stocks moving up quickly to an initial area of resistance, we should see some consolidation before the market continues moving higher. I would keep my eye on the 50-day moving average, as a break below this technical indicator might trigger additional selling pressure and lower prices over the short term. With gold mining stocks writing off bad assets, and physical demand still remaining quite strong, I think the risk/reward ratio remains in favor of having some allocation to this market sector as part of your investment strategy.

2014-02-26,Why I'm Even More Bullish on Gold Bullion Now,"Since the beginning of the year, one asset class has shone when compared to the stock market. I am talking about gold bullion. The yellow shiny metal’s prices are up more than 10%. The stock market, on the other hand, hasn’t performed as well. For example, year-to-date, the S&P 500 is only up by little more than one percent. With this said, I believe gold bullion can surprise investors even more this year. Let me explain why… Also Read: NYSE holidays 2014 Looking from a technical analysis point of view, there are a few interesting developments that suggest gold bullion prices are heading higher. Remember the first rule of technical analysis: the trend is your friend, until it’s broken. With this in mind, please look at the chart below. Chart courtesy of www.StockCharts.com The downtrend that gold bullion prices were following since late 2012 has now been broken (black line). At the same time, we see prices breaking above the 200-day moving average for the first time since early 2013 and sustaining above the 50-day moving average. This suggests sentiment is turning bullish. In addition to this, we see indicators of momentum, like the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), suggest bulls are in control (as indicated by the black line below the chart). The fundamentals of gold bullion prices are suggesting investors are going to reap rewards as well. The demand continues to increase and the supply remains subdued. This is the perfect recipe for higher prices. In 2013, we saw central banks buy gold bullion; they have been net buyers of gold bullion since 2009. It will not be a surprise to see them buy even more gold bullion, considering currencies in the global economy are showing wild movements. On top of consumer demand—which we are seeing from China, India, and other countries—central banks buying the yellow metal just creates more pressure on the supply side. Last year, gold bullion prices fell victim to irrational selling; 2013 was not the year for those who bought gold-related investments. The sell-off that took place last year took out the speculators, and we are now starting to see some real buying. I don’t exactly know where gold bullion prices will go—it’s very difficult to place a specific target. I don’t think anyone can tell this. But looking at all the fundamentals and the technicals, I can’t help but be more bullish than I was before. Investors who are looking to profit from gold bullion prices have to look at their risk tolerance before making any buying decisions. Investors have to keep in mind that in the world of finance, a lot can change in a matter of days, so the riskier your bets are, the bigger the loss or profit is going to be. Investors with a low tolerance for risk may want to look at exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). For those investors who are looking for leveraged returns, they may look at ETFs like Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). For those who are willing to take on extraordinary risk, you might consider looking at ETFs like Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shrs (NYSE: NUGT).

2014-03-13,Adding Downside Protection To The Gold Miners ETF,"In a post on Monday (Gold's Bull Market), hedge fund manager and market technician Tim Knight highlighted a breakout in the chart for the gold-tracking ETF SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD). Last month, Tim noted he was bullish on gold miners as well in the longer term, though they could face a pullback in the shorter term. For those long the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), here are a couple of ways to hedge it over the next several months. 1) Hedging With Optimal Puts 5.99% cost. Uncapped upside. As of Wednesday afternoon, these were the optimal puts* to hedge 1,000 shares of GDX against a greater-than-15% drop over the next several months with optimal puts. As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the cost of this protection, as a percentage of position value, was 5.99%. 2) Hedging With An Optimal Collar Pays you to hedge. 15% upside cap. If you were willing to cap your potential upside at 15% between now and September 19th, this was the optimal collar** to hedge 1,000 shares of GDX against a greater-than-15% drop over the same time frame. As you can see at the bottom of the screen capture above, the net cost of this collar, as a percentage of position value, was negative, meaning you would essentially get paid to hedge. Note that, to be conservative, Portfolio Armor calculated the cost of this hedge by using the bid price of the call leg and the ask price of the put leg. In practice, you can often sell calls for more (at some price between the bid and ask) and buy puts for less (again, at some price between the bid and ask), so, in actuality, an investor opening the collar above may have gotten paid more than $360 to do so. Possibly More Protection Than Promised In some cases, hedges such as the ones above can provide more protection than promised. For an example of that, see this post about hedging shares of Tesla Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA). *Optimal puts are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest possible cost. Portfolio Armor uses an algorithm developed by a finance PhD to sort through and analyze all of the available puts for your stocks and ETFs, scanning for the optimal ones. **Optimal collars are the ones that will give you the level of protection you want at the lowest net cost, while not limiting your potential upside by more than you specify. The algorithm to scan for optimal collars was developed in conjunction with a post-doctoral fellow in the financial engineering department at Princeton University. The screen captures above come from the Portfolio Armor iOS app."

So far the courts have sided with the legality of the subsidies, but if the Supreme Court changes the ruling it could slow the expansion of health insurance in the states. A sector that will be watching the hearings will be IHF, which is a basket of health care providers with a heavy concentration on the health insurance companies.

2014-03-26,Gold ETFs Face Fed-Induced Headwinds,"Gold bullion and mining ETFs have been on fire this year as investors have returned to a beaten down asset class that may offer diversification and security from equity volatility. At the beginning of the year, value-seeking traders were hungry to step back into gold as a contrarian turnaround play that was boosted by a January drop in stocks. However, traders are starting to see the first cracks in the gold market that will test the resolve of bulls going forward. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE: GLD) and Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) are two of the most closely tracked funds in this space that peaked in mid-March, but have been steadily losing ground over the last two weeks. GLD tracks the daily spot price of gold bullion, while GDX is a diversified basket of 40 global companies engaged in gold mining and exploration. Each of these ETFs allows you to access a specific segment of the gold market according to your preference of commodity or equity-related holdings. See also: Housing Sector - ETF or Stocks? Since hitting a peak this month, GLD has declined more than five percent on a closing basis, while GDX has lost more than 12 percent of its value. One of the biggest catalysts for this most recent drop was the release of the Federal Reserve meeting minutes that solidified their commitment to reducing asset purchases and forecasting a timeline for rate increases. Investors in the yellow metal may be spooked that gold will return to 2013-style price declines in the face of rising interest rates and low inflationary prospects. On the flip side, gold demand in Asia appears to be strong as Bloomberg reported that that imports to China rose in February as more banks sought to import the precious metal. Long-term buyers may be looking to increase their holdings at advantageous prices and to meet demand for retail consumers. Gold could also see another boost if equity volatility once again ramps up and traders go fleeing from stocks. Ultimately this tug of war will be interesting to watch as additional guidance from the Federal Reserve, asset flows, and global demand statistics continue to develop this year."
2014-05-15,Best Stocks Under $5 Right Now,"Most mutual funds are not allowed to buy stocks trading below $5, these equities are often too risky for hedge funds and these companies are typically covered by just a couple analysts, if any. The low profile these of these companies makes them some of the best value plays around. However, there is significant risk in buying small equities. Not only will the standard deviation of return for these issues be higher as the small float allows them to be pushed around, but there are several reasons the stocks should be priced at $5. They firm could be going out of business, there could be fraudulent activity and a high amount of uncertainty could make it hard to predict future cash flows. The companies on this list have several characteristics in common. To reduce risk: the current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) is greater than one, institutions have not cut their positions by more than five percent in the most recent quarter, and cash flows have increased in the past 12 months versus the previous 12 months to ensure these companies are not value traps. To find value: Price/book and Price/equity were used. Related: FireEye To Repeat Twitter Lock-Up? LifeVantage Founded in 2003, LifeVantage (NASDAQ: LFVN) has grown its sales to over $200 million per year. The company researches and sells scientifically validated anti-aging products. The company is currently researching an oxidative stress product. Revenue rose 65.1 percent year over year although income dropped 33.3 percent from $12 million to $8 million. SG&A expenses are responsible for most of the drop, making up 68.3 percent of 2013 sales and 76 percent of 2014 sales. The company says this increase was to support infrastructure and personnel. Regardless, scalability is one concern for the business. LifeVantage has a high price/book, but does well on all other metrics tested. Cash flow grew 2.63 percent in the last year, putting the company in the 95th percentile for the industry, return on equity is 49.71 percent and institutional ownership has risen 9.08 percent. Ultrapetrol Limited 2014 has been a strong year for large cap shippers, however Ultrapetrol (NASDAQ: ULTR) has dropped almost 22 percent. As the name suggests, Ultrapetrol ships oil products, but also ships grain, forest products and minerals. Because of seasonality in the business, annual financial statements give better insight as to how the company is performing versus quarterly statements. Revenue is up 31.3 percent year over year and income jumped from a $64 million loss to $7 million gain. Shares have reacted very positively over that period (shares up almost 40 percent), but the company is still cheap when compared to peers. The price/book is just 1.02, limiting downside, forward PE is 11.8 and positive cash flow growth puts Ultrapetrol in the 87th percentile of the industry. Zix Corporation Zix (NASDAQ: ZIXI) offers email encryption and data loss prevention technologies for companies that have employees bring their own devices (ie Laptops) to the workplace. The company launched a mobile solution in 2013. According to research firm IBISWorld, “The increasing trend of employees using their own mobile devices in the workplace, dubbed bring-your-own-device (BYOD), has led to numerous security concerns. As businesses accept the benefits of increased employee satisfaction, lower operational costs and productivity gains achieved by instituting a BYOD policy, they will increasingly demand mobile security software.” Zix has an impressive current ratio of 1.4 and very little long term debt ($2.9 million with annual earnings of $10.5 million). These two factors take a lot of risk out of the company by making it less susceptible to downturns in sales. Institutions have cut their stake by 1.54 percent for the most recent quarter. Although this figure is slightly alarming, it is not enough to discourage taking on a position. Gold Fields Although gold miners have performed well in 2014 as measured by the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), these companies are down 47 percent since the start of 2013. Margins were crushed over this time period as gold futures fell from their peak of $1,923.70 to las low as $1,179.40. Gold Fields (NYSE: GFI) is actually trading at just 0.8 times book value. The company also has one of the strongest increases in cash growth in the industry for the past year versus the previous year at 1.09 percent. In addition, gold has proven support just below the $1,300 level, which should help prices from falling. Geopolitical and equity markets are also likely to put upward pressure on the price of the commodity (and subsequently Gold Fields)."

2014-05-27,Gold And Gold Miners Give Up 2014 Gains,"Gold is melting down Tuesday and bringing miners down with it. A key catalyst driving down the price in gold is the successful presidential election in Ukraine. Presidential elections held on Sunday were widely opposed by pro-Russian supporters, leaving the investing community concerned that intense fighting in the country would increase instability. Pro-Russian supporters blocked some from voting, but the elections were widely regarded as a success and Vladimir Putin recognized the vote. Related: Best Stocks Under $5 Right Now Because this success is seen as taking risk out of the region, investors are able to transfer funds from gold to equities, while maintaining a similar risk level in their portfolio. In addition, the value of the Ruble is up 0.62 percent Tuesday versus the dollar, indicating that Russian entities and traders are selling gold for Rubles. The opposite was seen at the outbreak of the conflict. Gold is often used as a hedge against inflation and equity downturns. The USDX is up more than half a percent over the past five trading sessions and major indexes are trading near all-time highs, reducing the appeal of the commodity. Gold futures were last trading down more than two percent to $1,266.10; this is the lowest gold contracts have traded since the beginning of February. Although significantly down from its $1,392.6 2014 high, contracts are still up 5.7 percent since opening the year. Gold miners, who typically move in tandem to the price of gold, are down 3.69 percent according to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). This is the lowest miners have been trading since January, after peaking at a 31.24 percent gain earlier this year. The $23 level had been acting as support for GDX for the entirety of the year, however, this level was breached Tuesday, increasing the downside risk. Junior gold miners, who are more sensitive to a move in gold price because they are less able to weather a downturn in price, are down more than five percent Tuesday. Miners have been working at lowering their cost to mine an ounce after 2013’s downturn in price, with larger operators generally having more success. Despite the announcement of cost reductions in the first part of 2014, miners are currently trading at a very small premium to the movement in gold price."
2014-05-27,Gold and Gold Miners Give Up 2014 Gains,"Gold is melting down Tuesday and bringing miners down with it. A key catalyst driving down the price in gold is the successful presidential election in Ukraine. Presidential elections held on Sunday were widely opposed by pro-Russian reporters, leaving the investing community concerned that intense fighting in the country would increase instability. Although pro-Russian supporters blocked some from voting, the elections were widely regarded as successful and Vladimir Putin recognized the vote. Because this success is seen as taking risk out of the region, investors are able to transfer funds from gold to equities while maintaining a similar risk level in their portfolio. In addition, the value of the Ruble is up 0.62 percent Tuesday versus the dollar, indicating that Russian entities and traders are selling gold for Rubles. The opposite was seen at the outbreak of the conflict. Gold is often used as a hedge against inflation and equity downturns. The USDX is up more than half a percent over the past five trading sessions and major indexes are trading near all time highs, reducing the appeal of the commodity.

2014-05-27,"Gold ETFs On The Verge Of A Major Breakdown (GLD, GDX, GDXJ)","The price of gold is falling once again Tuesday, down one percent in early trading to the lowest level since February. Leading Tuesday’s sell-off are the numbers out of China regarding the precious metal. Chinese net imports of gold from Hong Kong fell to 67 tons in April, much lower than the 85 tons in March. This is the lowest monthly number since February 2013. Analysts believe that Chinese banks are already sitting on large amounts of gold after going on a buying spree in 2013. According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in the week ending May 20, hedge funds and money managers cut their bullish bets in gold and went as far to establish short positions in silver. Related: Catching Up With The BRIC ETFs (BKF, BIK, EEB) In the past, gold has been viewed as a hedge against geopolitical tension, slow economic environments and a falling U.S. dollar. The tensions around the world have been fairly high, the world economy is growing moderately and the U.S. is not far from a multi-year low. Yet, gold has struggled to move higher. On a technical basis, the SPDR Gold ETF (NYSE: GLD) is on pace to finish Tuesday at the worst close since early February. This breakdown would have the ETF completing a descending triangle pattern that is highly negative. The pattern includes a series of lower highs (dating back to March) and a flat support level ($123.50 area). A close below support is a sell signal and could send GLD back down to the $115 area. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has been forming a similar pattern and is now well below its support level of $23.25. If the pattern continues, it could send GDX down another 10 percent to test the lows of late 2013. Not to miss out on the bearish party is the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), which is down nearly three percent on Tuesday and is trading at the lowest level since January. Considering gold has not been able to rally in the face of geopolitical uncertainty and a falling U.S. dollar over the last couple of years, the current technical breakdown does not bode well for the yellow metal. Investors need to take a good long look at the charts before considering an investment in gold ETFs."

2014-06-19,3 Gold & Silver Mining ETFs Rocketing Higher In June,"Precious metals and mining stocks have been mired in a pernicious slump that has failed to exhibit any encouraging signs of late. While the attention has all been focused on the Federal Reserve and new highs in the broader market, several gold and silver ETFs have been making a stealth move higher in June as well. The MarketVectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) represents 40 publicly traded companies around the world that are engaged in the exploration, mining, and refinement of gold bullion. This ETF currently has more than $7.7 billion dedicated to a blend of market-cap styles as a representative benchmark for the industry. GDX has been on a roller coaster ride during the first half of 2014. After getting off to a strong start, this ETF has been on a decline that returned its price to the flat line for the year. Related Link: Semiconductor ETFs Are This Year's Technology Titans However, a renewed surge in gold prices has thrust these stocks back into the spotlight. Since the beginning of June, GDX has jumped over 15 percent and could retest its prior March high if conditions remain favorable for this momentum to continue. In addition, the small company focused MarketVectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) has leapt more than 25 percent this month. This impressive strength shows just so fast markets can turn when sentiment and public opinion is working against a particular sector like gold that is closely watched. Whether or not this is a short-term relief rally as a respite from selling pressure or the start of a new uptrend remains to be seen. However, gold miners aren’t the only precious metals companies leading a turn around this month. The Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) has also jumped more than 22 percent as silver bullion prices have recovered back above their 200-day moving average. This ETF is laser-focused on just 26 companies engaged in the silver mining industry. If precious metals prices continue to rally, it could spark additional interest in more aggressive mining stocks that would reignite a fire under this beaten down asset class."

Portugal was concerning, but investors realized the issues may be contained to the small European country. The share of the total global market cap for Portugal is only 0.13 percent and is not a major economic player. That being said, there could be contagion fears as the issues with Portugal could possibly spread to the peripheral euro countries such as Spain and Italy. SPDR Financial ETF (NYSE: XLF) The first big financial stock reported earnings this morning. Well Fargo (NYSE: WFC) reported EPS of $1.01, which was up 3 percent from last year.

The stock is the largest holding in XLF, making up 8.9 percent of the allocation. Both WFC and XLF rallied off the lows yesterday. Expect the early reaction this morning to be negative, however there could easily be some buying on weakness. Global X FTSE Argentina 20 ETF (NYSE: ARGT) The country is trying to figure out how to make payments on billions of dollars of debt and at the same time concentrating on their soccer team that is vying for the World Cup on Sunday afternoon. While the country is uber busy the ETF that tracks 20 large stocks based in Argentina is having a great run.

Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) The basket of gold stocks is set to open higher this morning, however the action yesterday was troubling. After a rally to the best level since early March as stocks plummeted, the ETF did a reversal that sent GDX to close out the day down 2 percent. This type of action at/near a high is typically a bad omen for investors of the ETF and they must now realize there is a big red flag flying over the chart."

2014-09-16,Gold ETFs Lacking Bullish Catalysts,"The gold bugs received some dire news this week as the two largest consumers of the precious metal announced a significant decline in second quarter purchases. China cut its gold purchases by about 50 percent from a year ago, while India cut their purchases by nearly 40 percent. This is significant because the two countries together account for more than 70 percent of the global demand for gold. Weak Demand In the past unstable geopolitical landscapes similar to today have been a positive catalyst for gold, as it was perceived a safe haven investment. Investors appear to be betting that political tension in the Middle East and Ukraine will not escalate much further. Related Link: Apple Inc. Event Triggers Winners And Losers A strong U.S. dollar is also responsible for a fall in the value of gold. Historically gold and the U.S dollar move inversely to each other. This is due to gold being priced in U.S. dollars; when the value of the currency increases, the metal becomes more expensive for foreign purchasers. SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) The SPDR Gold Trust ETF is the largest gold ETF and one of the largest ETFs in the market. The ETF tracks the futures price of gold. The index is down 25 percent over the last three years as well as 7 percent over the last 12 months, and is also down 10 percent over the last six months. The losses are not astronomical, but considering what the stock market has done during that time the underperformance becomes more evident. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF follows 40 small-, mid- and large-cap companies around the world that are primarily involved in gold mining. Its top holdings include Goldcorp Inc. (USA) with a 13.6 percent holding, Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) at 12.8 percent and Newmont Mining Corp at 8.4 percent. GDX has outperformed GLD over the last 12 months down only 5 percent, but hasn’t been able to do the same over the last six, down 11 percent. The chart of both ETFs offers little for the bulls. GLD is trading at its lowest level since January and recently broke an important support at the $119.50 area. The next level of support is at the $114.50 area, which if broken would be a major sell signal. GDX has also been in a free fall and should find some support around the $22 level if the selling continues. Gold may be setting up for a bounce, as India is entering a cultural period where gold has historically been at its highest demand. That being said, the charts of both ETFs are ugly. No long-term fundamental catalysts will drive investors back into the metal unless the geopolitical situation escalates greatly."
2014-09-20,Best And Worst ETFs Of The Week Amid Alibaba Group Holding Ltd Euphoria,"The markets finished slightly higher on the week despite history being made on the New York Stock Exchange with the biggest initial public offering in history.

The following ETFs represent a sample of the best- and worst-performing funds over the last five trading sessions. BEST: Small-Cap Technology Stocks Small-cap stocks have been overlooked for the majority of the year due to their underperformance versus large-cap peers. However, the October rally has been characterized by a return to risk assets that have favored beaten down sectors for a strong rebound. Related Link: Recent Quantitative ETFs Contend Against Established Favorites The PowerShares S&P Small Cap Information Technology Portfolio (NASDAQ: PSCT) has been the beneficiary of positive earnings and momentum this week that catapulted it to the top of the ETF charts with a gain of more than 7 percent. PSCT tracks 111 small-growth stocks in the technology and electronics sector. Standout companies that helped drive gains in this ETF include Tyler Technologies and Maximus Inc. PSCT has $220 million in total assets and charges an expense ratio of 0.29 percent. WORST: Gold Miners The price of gold bullion fell to new 2014 lows on Friday, which did significant damage to gold mining stocks. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) fell 18 percent over the last five trading days as lower commodity prices continued to send investors heading for the exits. GDXJ tracks 63 small- and mid-capitalization gold and silver mining companies. These junior miners tend to be more sensitive to industry volatility and as such are experiencing the sharpest drop of the group. The large-cap focused Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) also fell to new year-to-date lows as well. The higher-than-average volume and bearish sentiment for gold stocks may indicate that a capitulation-style event is taking place. However, these stocks have yet to signal that a bottom is in place."
2014-11-10,"Retail, Gold Miners And Small-Cap ETFs To Watch This Week","The market last week once again set an all-time high on Friday as investors continued to cheer solid earnings and macroeconomic data. The recovery from the October low has shown tremendous resilience that appears ready to be carried forward into the end of the year. The week ahead features a light economic calendar that is headlined by October retail sales data. In addition, several high profile companies such as Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Cisco Systems, Inc. are set to report earnings. Here are the key ETFs to watch for the week of Monday, November 10. Market Vectors Retail ETF (NYSE: RTH) On Friday, the results of October retail sales will be released and the consensus is for a net gain of 0.2 percent after last month's disappointing contraction. This data has the potential to impact RTH, which tracks 25 of the largest U.S.-listed retail companies by market capitalization. Related Link: Earnings Expectations For The Week Of November 10 This ETF will also find itself influenced by the earnings results of Wal-Mart this week, as this mega-retailer makes up more than 10 percent of the total portfolio. RTH currently has $100 million in total assets and has gained 8 percent year to date. Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) After crashing to new year-to-date lows, gold mining stocks rebounded strongly late last week. GDX, which tracks 41 global gold mining companies, rose 8 percent on Friday and will look to build on those gains moving forward. One item to note for this sector is the strength last week that came on the highest volume of the year, possibly signaling that institutional investors are waking up to the deep value in this space. However, despite the big move off the lows, these commodity stocks have a long way to go to recoup losses for the year. iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE: IWM) Small-cap stocks have been a serial underperformer this year relative to their large-cap peers. However, the broad-based index of small-cap companies in IWM has now rebounded back into positive territory for the year. Further strength in this sector will bode well for the market moving forward and should be a key indicator of investor sentiment. IWM will be an important segment of the market to watch in the weeks ahead to see if it can play catch up before 2014 comes to a close."

2014-12-11,Have Gold ETFs Finally Turned?,"Gold ETFs have come under fire this year for their persistent weakness and disjointed trading patterns. The combination of a rising U.S. dollar, falling interest rates and tepid inflationary statistics have not been kind to gold bullion prices or associated mining stocks. More recently, traders have been focused on plunging crude oil and natural gas prices, which has allowed gold the opportunity to make a stealthy move higher. This development may be a signal that a trend change is in the works for the yellow metal. Related Link: Has Gold Found A Bottom? SPDR Gold Trust Since bottoming in early November, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) has pressed nearly 8 percent higher and regained its 50-day moving average. This well-known precious metals fund is designed to track the daily price fluctuations of gold bullion and has shown marked strength in recent weeks. Market Vectors Gold Miners Another corner of the gold market that has seen an even stronger bounce is the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). This index tracks 41 large- and mid-cap gold mining stocks from around the globe. GDX currently has $6.4 billion in total assets and charges an expense ratio of 0.53 percent. After having fallen 40 percent from its 2014 high-water mark, GDX has rebounded 19 percent off the November lows. It too has regained its 50-day moving average and may be mounting a counter-trend rally to regain more of those substantial losses. Other Possible Factors Gold has traditionally been a flight to quality instrument during periods of stock volatility and had a noticeable uptick during the October selloff. Further deterioration in equities may generate renewed interest in gold as a hedge instrument. Another factor that may propel gold buyers is a pullback in the U.S. dollar index. The PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP) has had a powerful five-month winning streak that may be due for a breather. A consolidation or weakness in the dollar may provide a catalyst for global investors to load up on gold bullion or gold mining stocks."

(USA) (NYSE: GG) is one of GDX’s top holdings and it is down approximately 16 percent year-to-date. Physical gold was down 1.53 percent over the past year and this is reflected in GLD’s performance.

2014-12-30,Why Brian Kelly Is Betting On Gold For 2015,"Brian Kelly is long the gold miners. He’s the founder and managing member of Brian Kelly Capital, and he recently joined Benzinga’s #PreMarket Prep to talk about why he thinks 2015 could be a big year for gold. Kelly said he’s thought this for a while now, but there are multiple factors that could make it come to fruition in the upcoming year. “One, if the economy does get much stronger, at some point in time, you may get somewhat of an inflation plan there,” he said, but noted that it looks like the economy is seeing more deflation, if anything. Related Link: Why Dennis Gartman Says Oil Will Go 'Demonstrably Lower' More importantly, Kelly explained that the central bank-buying and physical buying of gold, which he said is happening in Asia, did happen in Russia and could potentially happen in Europe. “That, to me, is the big factor in the gold market of 2015: that physical buying,” he said. There’s a disconnect between physical buying and the gold ETFs, the paper gold, Kelly went on, which is why he liked the gold miners better. He’s long the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). He likes those because that’s how an investor purchases gold without actually taking possession of the bar, itself. Kelly expects the miners to outperform on the upside in the coming year. For example, if gold is up 1 percent, he said investors can expect to see miners up 2 to 3 percent. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) both traded about 1 percent higher in Tuesday's session, while GDX traded up more than 4 percent. Kelly also talked about crude oil and the U.S. dollar.

2015-01-12,"Gold Miner, Banking And Spain ETFs To Watch This Week","Last week, the S&P 500 Index was bolstered over 1 percent higher as accommodative language from the Federal Reserve helped restore confidence in risk assets. Moving forward, the fate of the markets may hinge on company earnings announcements, which kick off on Monday with Alcoa. The week ahead also features the release of December retail sales, latest consumer price index reading and consumer sentiment data. Here are the key ETFs to watch for the week of Monday, January 12: Market Vectors Gold Miners (NYSE: GDX) Gold mining stocks are determined to reverse multiple years of misfortune in 2015 by kicking off the New Year on a positive note. GDX has gained more than 12 percent so far this year and hit a three-month high on Friday. This ETF tracks 38 global stock engaged in gold and silver mining efforts. The catalysts for a continued move higher in GDX may include a weaker U.S. dollar, strength in gold bullion prices, or rotation to a beaten down sector of the market. No matter the case, this ETF bears watching to see if its recent momentum is sustainable for a new uptrend. SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE: KBE) A number of key banks report earnings this week, including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. As a result, KBE has the potential to be a fast-moving area of the market. This ETF tracks 64 national and regional banks using a modified equal-weighted methodology. KBE experienced a volatile 2014 that included vicious price swings in both directions. A positive showing by some of the largest banks in this index may provide confidence for a more established trend to develop this year. iShares MSCI Spain Capped ETF (NYSE: EWP) Spanish stocks hit a new 52-week low on Friday as this European economy continues to struggle. EWP has $1.4 billion spread amongst 29 large and mid-sized companies. This single-country ETF has lost more than 6 percent in 2015 and is one of the more heavily oversold areas of Europe. The largest holding in EWP is Banco Santander S.A., which represents 21 percent of the underlying assets. The bank is struggling to boost its capital this year by cutting its dividend and introducing another public share offering."

2015-02-11,2 Unlikely Year-To-Date ETF Performance Leaders,"The race for the best performing sector or asset class of 2015 is still in its nascent stages. However, two unlikely candidates have emerged in leadership roles from beaten down areas of the globe through the first six weeks of the year. The following ETFs represent areas of strength amid the backdrop of heightened stock market volatility. Gold Mining Stocks The iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF (iShares Inc.)(NYSE: RING) has shown a strong bounce in price this year after having fallen more than 17 percent in 2014. Despite flying under the radar with just $63 million in total assets, this ETF has now jumped nearly 15 percent higher. Those returns in RING were as high as 25 percent in January, but a dip in gold bullion prices have led to a pullback in this niche ETF. RING tracks 33 global stocks engaged in all aspects of the gold mining industry. Well-known companies such as Goldcorp Inc. (USA) (NYSE: GG) and Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE: ABX) make up the top two holdings in this market-cap weighted ETF. Another fund that has benefited from the bounce in this sector is the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). GDX is the largest ETF in this space, with $7.4 billion in total assets along with a slightly broader base of 38 world-wide companies. So far this year, GDX has gained over 13 percent in total return. Russian Stocks After being one of the most heavily sold areas of the globe last year, Russian stocks are showing some resilience in recent weeks. The Market Vectors Russia ETF Trust (NYSE: RSX) tracks a basket of 49 companies domiciled in this emerging market country. So far this year, RSX has gained over 15 percent and recently hit new 2-month highs. The economic engine of Russia is heavily dependent on oil prices, which are seeking to stabilize in recent weeks. Related Link: Utility, Russia And Mid-Cap ETFs To Watch This Week The iShares Msci Russia Capped Index Fund (NYSE: ERUS) has also jumped over 12 percent since the start of the year. Both funds have regained their 50-day moving averages, which may be seen as a sign of technical strength in the near-term. Ultimately, it’s too early to tell whether these moves are just the result of quick bounces in an oversold asset class or whether a new trend change has truly arrived. Either way, it’s worth keeping these ETFs on your radar screen to see if they can retain their leadership roles."
2015-02-22,Carter Worth And Mike Khouw's Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF Trade,"On CNBC's Options Action, Carter Worth spoke about the gold mining sector and he presented his technical analysis on Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Worth presented several charts of The Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index and he compared its performance with the S&P 500 Index. While the S&P 500 was in the uptrend the Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index traded lower. He also showed a recent move higher in Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE: NEM), which performed well on better-than-expected earnings. Worth added that it is going to continue to outperform other miners. On the chart of Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF, Worth showed that it is currently trading at its support and he thinks that it is going to bounce off the support. He is a buyer of the stock. Mike Khouw said that he was impressed by Newmont Mining's earnings because the company posted lower-than-expected costs. Khouw wants to make a bullish bet by buying the June 21 call for $1.85 and sell the June 26 call for $0.45 in Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF. The spread would cost him $1.40 and the breakeven for the trade is at $22.40. The maximal profit is $3.60."
2015-03-06,Best And Worst ETFs Of The Week Amid Strong Jobs Report,"Friday’s jobs report indicated a better-than-expected gain of 295,000 payrolls, which originated despite the shortened month of February and inclement weather conditions across much of the country. This data sent both stocks and bonds lower, as investors started to anticipate the U.S. economic growth engine may force the Federal Reserve’s hand in raising benchmark interest rates this year. One of the strongest areas of the market on Friday was the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP), which gained over 1 percent and continues its near vertical ascent to new 52-week highs. This move in currencies weighed heavily on international investments and gold-backed funds such as the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) as well. The following ETFs represent a sample of the best- and worst-performing funds over the last five trading sessions. BEST: Solar Stocks Solar stocks have been on a tremendous push this year and the Guggenheim Solar ETF (NYSE: TAN) is one of the beneficiaries of this strength. TAN gained 11 percent this week and is now more than 28 percent higher since the start of 2015. This ETF is the largest index dedicated to 29 stocks in the solar industry with over $400 million in total assets. TAN is a truly global fund, with 47 percent of the portfolio allocated to the United States and the remainder spread among China, Hong Kong and other developed nations. The relative strength of TAN versus the broader market should make this ETF one to watch over the course of 2015. Related Link: Tintic Standard Gold Mines Executes Two Mining Leases WORST: Gold Miners Gold mining stocks truly felt the effects of falling bullion prices and equity volatility this week. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) dropped more than 12 percent over the last five trading sessions and has nearly erased all of its gains for the year. GDX tracks a portfolio of 38 small-, mid- and large-cap global mining companies. This ETF has more than $7 billion in total assets and has been in a slow decline since peaking in January. Gold mining stocks typically exhibit higher volatility than traditional gold-bullion prices, and Friday’s weakness may bring out more sellers anticipating further downside."

They have been wrong for years, and once again they will walk away with their tails between their legs. The recent pullback is nothing more than a normal gyration within a strong bull market. Three sector ETFs are sitting on support to offer investors attractive reward-to-risk setups: The iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF (NYSE: ITB), which follows 37 U.S.-based companies that in one way are involved with the construction of residential homes. The top weighted sectors in the ETF are household durables at 70 percent and building materials at 13.4 percent. The top individual holdings include Lennar Corp (NYSE: LEN) with a 10.8 percent holding, D.R. Horton Inc (NYSE: DHI) making up 10.8 percent and Pulte Homes Inc (NYSE: PHM) with 9 percent.

The top individual holdings include Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE: TM) at 6.6 percent, Mitsubishi Financial Group Inc. (NYSE: MYU) at 2.8 percent and Honda Motor Ltd (NYSE: HMC) at 1.9 percent. The ETF is up 6 percent over the last 12 months and up 3 percent over the last six months. It is sitting on price support in the $12 area with a 50-day and 200-day moving average near $11.75. The ETF has an expense ratio of 0.49 percent. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) follows 38 small, mid and large cap companies around the world, which are primarily involved in the gold mining sector. The top holdings include Goldcorp Inc (NYSE: GG) at 10.2 percent, Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE: ABX) making up 8.5 percent, and Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE: NEM) totaling 7.5 percent. GDX is down 31 percent over the last 12 months and down 26 percent over the last six months. It is not in a similar uptrend as the first two ETFs, but it is sitting on price support in the $17 area.

Gold futures were trading higher by $5.40 at $1186.30 in Wednesday's session. It had been trading near the lows for the session preceding the Fed's announcement to leave interest rates unchanged. It initially headed for the low of the session ($1173.90), but found buyers ahead of that level, reaching $1174.20 before staging over a $10 rally.

After a brief retreat to $1183.10, the rally resumed.

2015-07-24,Raymond James Upgrades Alamos Gold On Valuation,"In a report issued Friday, Raymond James analysts Phil Russo and Luc Troiani upgraded shares of Alamos Gold Inc (NYSE: AGI) to Outperform (from Market Perform) on an attractive valuation, but lowered their target price to from $8.00 to $6.00. The new price target implies an upside potential of almost 100 percent. The Rationale After the company closed the merger with AuRico Gold Inc (NYSE: AUQ) on July 2, the firm felt investors would be better off on the sidelines regarding Alamos. This conservative view was motivated by “uncertainty related to its Turkish assets, Mulatos currently being short of steady-state momentum and with the inclusion of Young Davidson’s ramp-up in the portfolio, as well as, critically, its relative fair-valued pro-forma valuation at the time.” Related Link: Canaccord Upgrades Alamos Gold, Sees 39% Return Possibility In a previous note, the firm had noted that, “all of these concerns should, conceivably, be overcome with time, at which point we suspect the stock will have several compelling attributes to offer the incremental investor.” Since that moment, Alamos’ stock fell –unjustifiably- about 46 percent in two weeks, versus gold, at 7 percent, and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX), which lost 21 percent. So, now trading at a much more attractive valuation, the analysts believe “investors today will benefit in adding positions in Alamos at current levels where the risk/reward profile has swung in their favor.”"
2015-07-24,This Hedge Fund Manager Sees No Reason to be in Apple,"JC Parets is a weekly guest on #PreMarket Prep, a daily trading idea radio show hosted by Joel Elconin and Dennis Dick. Tune in to the daily broadcast live Monday-Friday at 8 a.m. ET here. Eagle Bay Capital Founder JC Parets told Benzinga's #PreMarket Prep that there was no reason to trade Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) until it breaks to either the upside or downside. So long as the price is mired in the $120 to $135 range, he advised that traders should look elsewhere because it is dead money. Parets said that his firm had a $129 price target on Apple, which was hit in February. There's been no reason to be in this [name] ever since, he added. Until we either resolve to the upside of the range or break to the downside, I don't see any reason to be involved in this. Parets said the same of the overall market. Since hitting a February high, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA: SPY) has moved from 204 to 212. Any traders that have tried to buy dips and sell the upper end of the range are doing well, though any other traders have been getting thrown around. You want to be in things that are trending, Parets added. Look elsewhere. There's always other places to be, he said. One of those places has been to short Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA: GDX). Though that sector hit Parets' downside target, he says that now the opportunity is to fade strength."

2015-07-28,This Is Why Nobody Loves Gold ETFs,"When it comes to commodities and the corresponding exchange traded funds, saying demand for a particular commodity is a big deal is an understatement. And it is demand, or lack thereof, for gold that is hampering ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), the world’s largest ETF backed by physical holdings of gold. It seems these days, bullion demand is anything but golden. Data out Tuesday from industry group GFMS show second-quarter gold demand among retail buyers in China slid 25 percent while jewelry demand slumped 23 percent, Reuters reported. China is the world’s largest gold-consuming country. GLD was trading modestly higher on Tuesday, but the ETF has slumped 9.7 percent over the past 90 days and on the demand side, there is little relief sight. India, the world’s second-largest gold-consuming country after China, is often pointed to as a potential catalyst to lift gold demand, but that probably won’t be the case this time around if demand does not pick up next month with the start of Indian wedding season. Related Link: Brazilian Bungle: Bad News Mounts For Brazil ETFs According to the World Gold Council, India imported 891.5 tons of gold last year while demand was 811.1 metric tons. The council believes consumption will increase to between 900 tons and 1,000 tons this year, according to ETF Trends. Investors don’t appear enthusiastic about the idea of waiting around for GLD to bounce. Nearly $976 million was yanked from the ETF during the second quarter and outflows are accelerating in the current quarter. The third quarter isn’t even a month old, but GLD has already bled $1.11 billion in assets. Waning enthusiasm for physical gold is also plaguing shares of gold miners. Over the past three months, four of the 12 worst-performing non-leveraged ETFs are gold or silver miners. That group includes the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the two largest miners ETFs by assets. Although there has been ample chatter regarding the cheap valuations on the miners and the merits of the group as a contrarian play, there is no getting around the fact that the group is out of favor with investors. Over the past three months, GDX has plunged 33 percent while GDXJ, the junior miners fund, has shed 25.4 percent over the same period. As is the case with GLD, investors appear exasperated with the miners. During the second quarter, investors yanked a combined $256 million from GDX and GDXJ, but those outflows are quickening this quarter as the ETFs have lost a combined $202 million just this month."

2015-07-29,Gold ETFs Have Some Famous Hedge Fund Supporters,"One of the more telling statistics about gold's recent retrenchment was news out last Friday that hedge funds are net short gold for the first time since 2006, the first year the Commodities Futures Trading Commission began collecting such data. Abandoning or shorting gold has been the way to go. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest exchange traded fund backed by physical holdings of the yellow metal, has plunged 9 percent over the past 90 days. Gold miners have been worse as highlighted by a three-month decline of almost 34 percent for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Still, some titans of the hedge fund world remain stubbornly long gold, including John Paulson and David Einhorn, according to the New York Post. Related Link: This Is Why Nobody Loves Gold ETFs At the end of the first quarter, Paulson's eponymous Paulson & Co. allocated over 5.9 percent of its equity portfolio to GLD, making the ETF the hedge fund's fourth-largest position, according to Whale Wisdom. The gold hits don't end there for Paulson. Paulson & Co. also held stakes in NovaGold (NYSE: NG), Agnico-Eagle Miners (NYSE: AEM), Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD) and Iamgold (NYSE: IAG) at the end of March, according to Whale Wisdom. Randgold, Agnico-Eagle, and Iamgold combine for nearly 12 percent of GDX's weight. That ETF has plunged 28.7 percent since the start of the second quarter. For his part, Einhorn's Greenlight Capital held 8,517,196 shares of GDX worth $155.8 million at the end of the first quarter, according to Whale Wisdom. That stake is now worth just over $116.5 million. That is not even scratching the surface of the bad news regarding Greenlight's GDX stake. Greenlight's GDX position, assuming it still exists, is nearing three years old. Over that time, the largest gold miners ETF has lost almost two-thirds of its value. To be fair, Einhorn's hedge fund once held as many as 6 million GDX shares. And to continue on the theme of fairness, second-quarter 13F filings are not due out for another several weeks, so it is possible that Einhorn and Paulson have trimmed their gold exposure. Again adding to fairness theme, Einhorn and Paulson are far from the only hedge fund managers with gold exposure. In fact, the number of hedge funds adding to or starting new positions in GDX in the first quarter outpaced those eliminating or paring positions in the ETF, notes WhaleWisdom. As for GLD, 64 13F filers in the first quarter featured the ETF among their top 10 holdings and 750 filers overall had a position in the ETF."

2015-08-12,Gold Consolidation Period Resolved To The Upside,"Joel Elconin is the co-host of Benzinga's #PreMarket Prep, a daily trading idea radio show. Gold futures were trading sharply higher by $16.70 at $1124.40 in Wednesday's session. After being in a trading range from $1072.80 to $1109.30 for 15 consecutive sessions, the consolidation period was resolved to the upside in Monday's session when it traded up to $119.10 before falling back to settle at $1107.70. Off a flat open, it dipped and found support ahead of the psychological support level of $1100, only reaching $1101.10 before reversing course. So far, the issue has rallied as high as $1124.60 and is currently trading at the level. If the rally continues, the next identifiable minor resistance level may be at its July 20 high ($1133) and there may be additional resistance at its July 17 high ($1145). Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) was trading at $15.32, up $0.80. SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) was trading at $107.71, up $1.45."
2015-08-14,Well Look At That: Gold Miners ETFs Try To Bounce Back,"Gold and the related exchange traded funds have been among this year's most moribund asset classes. Gold miners stocks and ETFs have fared noticeably worse, but despite some modest Friday losses, bullion and miners funds have been solid performers this week. China's move to devalue the yuan is being cited as a primary catalyst behind bullion bullishness this week and for those that are believers in seasonal trends, the start of India's wedding season is fast-approaching. That is an important gold catalyst because the country is the second-largest gold consumer in the world behind China. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is up 7.7 percent this week, a move that has brought some much needed relief to the downtrodden miners complex. With GDX rising, its leveraged counterparts are on fire. Heading into Friday's session, the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSE: JNUG) and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSE: NUGT) were that issuer's two best triple-leveraged funds on a month-to-date basis with gains of 20.8 percent and 16.3 percent, respectively. JNUG is the triple-leveraged answer to the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Remember, it was just a week ago that Direxion announced reverse splits of 1-for-10 for NUGT and 1-for-5 for JNUG. ETF reverse splits, in most meaning nearly all instances, do not come about because the fund in question is performing well. That is the case with JNUG and NUGT, which have posted an average year-to-date loss of over 62 percent. That dramatic decline underscores weakness in the mining complex, but as Direxion notes, some big gold miners are taking steps to deal with a turbulent environment for gold. “Randgold Resources, another top holding in the index, has avoided the worst of the turmoil that’s cut into profits for miners and has lowered costs, and raised cash. The best-performing gold miner over the last 10 years, is getting ready for prices to dip well below $1,000.” Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE: ABX) and Randgold Resources Ltd. (NASDAQ: GOLD) are the fourth- and fifth-largest holdings in the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDMNTR), the index tracked by GDX and the index NUGT attempts to deliver triple the daily returns of. The stocks combine for 11.3 percent of that index's weight. For the daring, risk-tolerant gold miners bulls, GDX, NUGT and JNUG could offer some allure at current levels. “The bulls may think that miners are poised to make a new run. In fact, according to Bloomberg, mining stocks are the cheapest relative to gold that they’ve been in 30 years. Some traders may take this as a sign to jump into miners because they’re oversold,” notes Direxion."

2015-08-19,"Highlights From The FOMC Minutes; Yields & U.S. Dollar Fall, Gold Rises","U.S. Treasury bonds for both the short- and long-term and the U.S. dollar were falling on Wednesday, while gold prices were rising after the Federal Open Market Committee minutes were leaked. Many important issues were discussed in the meeting. Here's a look at some of the key points. The Committee reported on the developments and state of domestic and foreign financial markets; plans for examinations of the Term Deposit Facility in August and of term RRPs at the end of the third quarter of the year; and “recent steps the System had taken to prepare further for the process of normalization of monetary policy” among other subjects relevant to the economy. Most Fed officials noted rate hike conditions were “approaching,” although the labor market still has room for improvement and they would like to see a more achievable inflation outlook and additional markets data. However, one official said he/she would hike rates already, but was willing to wait for more evidence, as the others had agreed on. The staff highlighted “the risks to the forecast for real GDP and inflation were seen as tilted to the downside,” reflecting their assessment that neither fiscal nor monetary policy seemed to be able to help the economy endure considerable adverse shocks. “At the same time, the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced. Regarding the timing and pace of policy normalization, officials said a “premature policy tightening” could have limited ability “to offset downside shocks to inflation and economic activity when the federal funds rate was near its effective lower bound.” Most members assured the labor market slack could be mostly eliminated in the near-term, leading to conditions “as at or very close to those consistent with maximum employment (…) However, several were concerned that labor market conditions consistent with maximum employment could take longer to achieve, noting, for example, the lack of convincing signs of accelerating wages, which might be signaling that the natural rate of unemployment could currently be lower than they previously thought.” Participants generally noticed consumer spending was recuperating, and said they expected it to surge moderately over the short-term. They also assured to still be expecting “that the downward pressure on inflation from the previous declines in energy prices and the effects of past dollar appreciation would prove to be temporary.” Shares of the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), ProShares Ultra Gold (ETF) (NYSE: UGL), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and iShares Gold Trust(ETF) (NYSE: IAU) were trading up on Wednesday afternoon."

2015-09-06,How ETFs Work & Why They Differ From Mutual Funds,"In a recent blog post, Kiana Danial (The Invest Diva) shared some thoughts on other investing opportunities outside the currencies world. “What's the best, less risky online trading instrument?” Danial, known for her expertise and focus on forex trading, asked. “Since I’m diving into this for the sole reason of portfolio diversification, it only makes sense to go for the industry that allows me to maximize my diversification.” Although her first instinct was going for mutual funds, Danial then discovered “an exciting new alternative that is very similar to mutual funds, only more accessible and retail-trader friendly. Kind of like Mutual Funds 2.0: She was referring to ETFs. ETFs “offer investors a way to pool their money in a fund that makes investments in stocks, bonds, or other assets [of a certain calls] and, in return, to receive an interest in that investment pool. So, when investors buy shares of an ETF, what they are buying is “shares of a portfolio that tracks the yield and return of its native index.” However, the Invest Diva noted, ETFs don't seek to outperform their corresponding index; all they do is replicate the index’s performance. The author then goes into the main differences between ETFs and mutual funds: 1) ETFs are relatively new financial instruments, unlike mutual funds. 2) Mutual funds are not as tax efficient as ETFs, since the latter “are passively managed portfolios. Therefore they tend to decrease or avoid capital gains comparing to the actively managed mutual funds. ETF’s are traded on an exchange just like a stock, but mutual-funds shares are redeemed with the Fund directly.” 3) ETFs’ trading expenses are lower than Mutual funds’. 4) ETFs are simpler and more flexible than Mutual funds. 5) ETFs are certainly more accessible to average investors. 6) ETFs can be traded all day long, like stocks, and unlike Mutual Funds, which can only be traded at the end of each day."
2015-09-09,Gold Slumps As Markets And Dollar Rally,"Joel Elconin is the co-host of Benzinga's #PreMarket Prep, a daily trading idea radio show. Gold futures were trading lower by $11.70 at $1109.30 in Wednesday's session. The stronger dollar and rally in the broad market has investors dumping gold as fear in the markets has subsided. Rallies in Asian markets have been a factor in the sell-off. After a flat open, it rallied but found resistance ahead of Tuesday's high ($1126), only reaching $1124.70 before reversing course. Once the support at the $1115 level was breached, the selling intensified. So far, it has reached $1108.30 and is not far from that level. The current low coincides with its low from August 18 ($1108.50). If the decline continues, the next identifiable support level may not come in until its August 12 low ($1101.10)."
2015-09-15,Gold Consolidates With A String Of Lower Highs Ahead Of Fed Decision On Rates,"Joel Elconin is the co-host of Benzinga's #PreMarket Prep, a daily trading idea radio show. Gold futures were trading lower by $4.40 at $1103.30 per ounce in Tuesday's session. Along with major indexes, Gold futures have been in a holding pattern ahead of Thursday's FOMC meeting. Over that last five trading sessions, the contract has been in a $1097.20 to $1124.70 trading range with a majority of the action taking place in the lower end of the range ($1100- $1112.00). During the last five sessions, Gold has bottomed in a tight range surrounding the psychological support level of $1100, with all of the lows between $1097.70 and $1102.60. Despite building a formidable base to rally from, the rallies have ended earlier and earlier. In fact, since reaching $1147.30 on September 9, it has put in place a series of nine consecutive lower highs, which is not a good sign for Gold bulls ahead of Thursday's interest rate decision."
2015-09-15,Not DUST In The Wind: Perhaps The Best Gold Miners ETF,"Punished by the stronger dollar and the specter of the Federal Reserve boosting interest rates, something that could happen as soon as this week, gold and the relevant exchange traded funds have struggled this year. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest ETF backed by holdings of physical gold, is down nearly 7 percent year-to-date. Things have been far worse for the ETFs holding shares of gold miners. The largest such fund, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), has plunged 28.6 percent this year, a loss that is more than quadruple that of GLD's. For risk-tolerant traders, GDX's woes and those of rival gold miners ETFs are not bad news. Actually, those struggles are good news for traders with the fortitude to embrace the Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST), the triple-leveraged inverse answer to GDX. DUST attempts to deliver three times the daily inverse performance of the NYSEArca Gold Miners Index, GDX's underlying benchmark. Related Link: Gold Consolidates With A String Of Lower Highs Ahead Of Fed Decision On Rates GDX's 2015 struggles have translated to a 27.1 percent year-to-date gain for DUST, though that is not an endorsement for holding DUST over the long term, which is not a good idea. DUST's nearly 20 percent fall from its August peak proves as much. Underscoring DUST's volatility and how rapidly the ETF can rise (and fall) is the fact that the ETF has endured that tumble and is still up 86 percent over the past 90 days. Even with that massive 90-day run, DUST may have more upside in store for active traders. DUST “is developing a positive trend. RSI as a gauge of short-term momentum is trending higher. It’s currently at 60.15, well above the August high of 58.4. The MACD provides another confluence as this trend indicator is currently above the zero line with a consistent increase in spread vs the signal line,” according to a Direxion note. Indeed, DUST is rebounding from its August tumble. The ETF entered Tuesday with a September gain of more than 24 percent, making it Direxion's second-best bearish triple-leveraged ETF on a month-to-date basis, according to issuer data. Further validating the potential for more near-term upside in DUST is flows data, which continue indicating traders are departing DUST in favor of GDX and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT), DUST's bullish counterpart. This is validation because as GDX and its rivals have slumped for going on three years now, inflows to bullish gold miners ETFs have served as indicators that investors and traders were hunting for bottoms that have yet to be found. “Year to date DUST has seen a notable $117 million vacate the fund via redemptions likely on profit taking into the recent Miners slump, but then again NUGT has seen substantial inflows of more than $800 million year to date in spite of continued pressure on Mining names,” said Street One Financial Vice President Paul Weisbruch in a note out Tuesday."
2015-09-21,Fast Money Traders Share Their Thoughts On Gold,"On CNBC's Fast Money, Guy Adami said that gold can continue to move higher and this move looks to him like decoupling from the U.S. dollar. Brian Kelly also likes gold and he believes that this is a beginning of a massive short squeeze. He wouldn't be surprised if gold reaches 1,300 or 1,400 in the short term. In the long run, he sees 2,000 as a possible target. Tim Seymour needs to see gold above 1,160 before he would trace it higher. He thinks that the downtrend is still intact. Steve Grasso said that traders who believe that gold is going higher should buy Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), because it will outperform gold 3 to 1 both up and down."
2015-10-04,ETF Week Ahead Preview: Proving Them Right...Or Wrong,"Despite a gloomy September jobs report, the bad news is good news mantra was back in play last Friday as all three major U.S. indexes finished the day with gains well in excess of one percent. However, traders and investors still face ample indecision with which to contend in the coming week. Now that the fourth quarter has started, market participants can start bracing for third-quarter earnings reports. In the week ahead, there are a just a few marquee names report, but one earnings-related play from the world of exchange traded fund to be mindful of is the Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR (NYSE: XLY) because several of the companies stepping into the earnings confessional this week hail from the discretionary sector. “Overall, corporate earnings are expected to fall by 4.1 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. That figure is skewed, however, by an expected 65 percent fall in energy sector results,” Reuters reports. Last week's top asset-gathering ETFs shed little light on what traders are feeling about the Federal Reserve's plans for interest rates. The fact that the rate-sensitive Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) and the even more rate-sensitive Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU) were among last week's top 10 asset gatherers, indicates some traders are expecting the Fed to keep rates where they are. On the other hand, the fact that the cyclical Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI) also made an appearance in the top 10 could be a sign that some money managers are bracing for Fed liftoff. Either that or some professionals are seeing opportunity with industrials, one of this year's worst-performing sectors. For the ultimate contrarian, there is opportunity afoot with emerging markets ETFs, but know that is a statement, not an endorsement. Last week, 15 of the top 20 non-leveraged ETFs were emerging markets ETFs, a group that includes the beaten up iShares MSCI Brazil Capped ETF (NYSE: EWZ) and several China ETFs. Emerging markets are the ultimate contrarian trade right now because investors cannot get away from developing world stocks fast enough. Third-quarter outflows from developing world stocks were the first since 2009 and the worst since 2008. The Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: VWO) and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: EEM), the two largest emerging markets ETFs by assets, lost over $6.5 billion last quarter. Speaking of contrarian ideas, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) certainly belongs in that conversation. The disappointing jobs report elicited a rally in gold, which was a boon for GDX as the largest gold miners ETF surged over eight percent. This paints the picture of how much GDX and rival gold miners ETFs have struggled this year: Even with last Friday's eight percent surge, one accrued on volume that was nearly 80 percent above average, still leaves GDX down 21.1 percent year-to-date. The good news is last week's surge lifted GDX above its 20- and 50-day moving averages. Commodities exchange traded products have been thrashed this year, but of the fewer than 30 ETFs that have posted double-digit gains over the past month, 10 are commodities ETFs or ETNs. That group includes, the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL). PALL has been the prime beneficiary of scandal-plagued Volkswagen AG's (OTC: VLKAY) woes. However, PALL's 19.5 percent one-month gain could make the ETF ripe for some near-term profit-taking."
2015-10-05,You Might Be Crazy To Buy This ETF Or It Might Really Work,"The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is down 13.7 percent this year, making it the second-worst performer among the nine sector SPDRs. The Market Vectors-Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Steel (ETF) (NYSE: SLX) are lower by 44.5 percent, 21.2 percent and 36.4 percent, respectively. With those data points in mind, it might seem like a death wish for a trading account to become involved with a metals and mining ETF of any type, let alone one that is heavy on gold miners, coal miners and steel producers. Mr. Market seems to believe as much, as the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME) has shed 43.2 percent this year. XME's woes are easily explained. The ETF allocates nearly 48 percent of its weight to steel stocks, and as if that is not bad enough, the fund devotes a combined 17.6 percent of its weight to coal and gold miners. Related Link: ETF Week Ahead Preview: Proving Them Right or Wrong Again, it might be crazy to get involved with an ETF like XME even at that 43 percent tumble, but some traders apparently see upside in the moribund fund as evidence by some unusual upside call buying in the fund last week. Crazy, Or Financially Savvy? On Thursday, “We saw action in infrequently traded XME (SPDR S&P Metals & Mining, Expense Ratio 0.35 percent) options, consisting of January 20 calls trading more than 20,000 times. Given XME’s $16 handle at the moment these options are more than 16 pecent out-of-the-money, but then again XME had a $20 handle just one month ago in the beginning of September before falling to current levels,” said Street One Financial Vice President Paul Weisbruch in a recent note. For one day at least, XME bulls looked smart as the ETF surged 4.6 percent last Friday, a day after that unusual call buying was spotted. As contrarian trade, XME merits consideration by the trader that believes in the mantra of be greedy when others are fearful. If old investing maxims are not one's cup of tea, one should consider the fact that relative to its recent track record, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF is starting to look pretty good. The largest gold miners' ETF jumped more than 8 percent last Friday and now resides above its 20- and 50-day moving averages. Improvements in GDX are important to XME because, as noted earlier, the latter devotes 10.3 percent of its weight to gold miners. Additionally, silver and other precious metals miners combine for almost another 13 percent of XME's lineup and four precious metals miners are found among XME's top 10 holdings. Looking Ahead Following Friday's close at $17.33, XME would need to gain 15.4 percent by January options expiry to bring the aforementioned calls to a point where profitability can be discussed. Given XME's penchant for volatility, it is possible these options could be winners. The S&P Metals and Mining Select Industry Index, XME's underlying index, has a five-year standard deviation of 35.45 percent compared to 15.15 percent for the S&P 1500, according to Standard & Poor's data.

2015-10-05,Bullish Leveraged Gold Miners ETFs Are On Fire,"Gold prices are trading modestly lower Monday with the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest exchange traded fund backed by physical holdings of bullion, down a quarter of a percent as traders wager whether the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates. Widely consider to be a positive for the dollar, higher interest rates are viewed as the opposite for gold because the yellow metal, like other commodities, is priced in dollars meaning it is vulnerable to a stronger greenback. That much has proven over the past two years, but gold's sensitivity to speculation on the Fed's next move is not stopping miners ETFs, including leveraged funds, from following through today on last Friday's impressive showings. Related Link: This ETF Is Begging Yellen To Raise Interest Rates After surging more than 8 percent last Friday, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) was higher by nearly 4 percent at time of writing. Several other precious metals miners ETFs rank among Monday's top percentage gainers among non-leveraged ETFs and that is excellent news for leveraged mining funds. Run With The Gold With GDX, the largest gold miners ETF, higher by almost 4 percent, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) is flirting with a Monday gain of nearly 12 percent and doing so on volume that could top the trailing 90-day average. Nearly 3.6 million shares have already changed hands in NUGT as of this writing and the ETF's average volume over the past three months is just over 5.1 million shares. As GDX was able to do last week, NUGT now resides above its 20- and 50-day moving averages though like its non-leveraged counterpart, NUGT has plenty of work to do to reclaim its 200-day line. NUGT resides more than 61 percent below that critical moving average. Dust Up Adding to the intrigue surrounding NUGT is that last Friday's pop did little to generate confidence among traders. Actually, data suggest traders saw NUGT's surge on that day as an opportunity to take profits and cozy up to its bearish equivalent, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST). Traders pulled $48.4 million from NUGT last Friday, the worst outflows tally for any of Direxion's triple-leveraged ETFs, according to issuer data. Conversely, DUST saw the best one-day inflows among Direxion leveraged ETFs with new assets arriving to the tune of $30.1 million. This is an important tell regarding DUST and NUGT because a rather easy trade has been to buy the member of this pair that everyone else is selling because, more often than not, the member of this pair riddled by outflows is the one seeing positive price action while the gaining assets is plunging. Consider this: NUGT has lost two-thirds of its value this year but has hauled in almost $730 million in new assets. On the other hand, DUST has lost about 27 percent year-to-date, with the bulk of those losses coming in recent weeks, but the ETF has seen outflows of roughly $126 million. Another important point to remember is that one needs to know what one is getting involved with DUST and NUGT. That means volatility. Over the past 30 days, only two of Direxion's leveraged bullish ETFs have been more volatile than NUGT and only two of the firm's bearish leveraged funds have been more volatile than DUST, according to issuer data."
2015-10-15,Here's How Traders Have Once Again Botched The Gold Miners Trade,"As sure as the day is long, there will be traders that get the gold miners exchange traded funds trade wrong. No, it is not always as simple as thinking for every trade in capital markets there has to be a winner and a loser. As has been previously noted in this space, one way of trading leveraged gold miners ETFs, such as the Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bull Shares (NYSE: NUGT), is to monitor flows data and buy the ETF that other traders are departing. That may not sound scientific, but it has worked. Guess What? That idea is working again. For the October 7 through October 14 period, traders have poured nearly $76 million into DUST and DUST is making them regret that move. The ETF is down nearly 25 percent over the past week and more than 62 percent over the past month. On Wednesday, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest ETF backed by physical holdings of gold, touched its highest levels since June. That sent the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, to its highest levels since July. GDX is just 5.8 percent below its 200-day moving average, something the ETF has not closed above since May. Related Link: Bullish Leveraged Gold Miners ETFs Are On Fire The $5.4 billion GDX has a three-year standard deviation of almost 37 percent, meaning the ETF is volatile. And that means gaining (or losing) 5.8 percent in a single day is not of realm of possibility. After all, GDX gained more than 6 percent Wednesday on double the average daily turnover. Alas, traders are missing out. Again. From October 7 through October 14, GDX and NUGT lost about $200 million in assets combined. Those departures come as NUGT has vaulted its way to becoming Direxion's best-performing triple-leveraged ETF on a month-to-date basis with an October gain now approaching 56 percent. Conversely, two of Direxion's worst-performing bearish ETFs this month are DUST and the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: JDST). However, for the five days ended October 13, DUST saw its average volume climb nearly 76 percent above the 20-day average while NUGT's turnover during those five days fell slightly below the 20-day average, according to Direxion data. That could be another sign that the long miners trade might have some room to run over the near-term and that run would only be fueled GDX reclaiming its 200-day moving average."

2015-10-19,This Mining ETF Is Trying To Mount A Comeback,"Shares of non-precious metals miners have continued slumping this year as highlighted by the performances of exchange-traded funds dedicated to coal producers and steelmakers. However, the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME) has recently been perking up, rising more than 2 percent over the past month. That might not sound like much, but consider this: The $259 million XME is down 40.5 percent this year and more than 47 percent over the past year. XME Headwinds Slack global economic growth forecasts and flooding of the market with cheap steel by foreign producers are among the headwinds XME and its 30 holdings have had to deal with in recent years. Slumping steelmakers are a significant problem for XME, as the ETF devotes 48 percent of its weight to that group. That makes steel producers XME's larges industry weight at nearly quadruple the weight assigned to diversified miners, the ETF's second-largest sector exposure. Related Link: Bullish Leveraged Gold Miners ETFs Are On Fire “An appreciating U.S. dollar, excess global capacity due to weaker demand in China and the influx of cheap imports has negatively impacted U.S. domestic steel producers’ market share and margins due to the extreme price competition,” said S&P Capital IQ in a note out Monday. “However, S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Matthew Miller believes the worst is over for steel producers and we see upcoming catalysts from pending trade case determinations. He thinks that imports will revert back down to historical levels, allowing steel producers to benefit from a gradually improving construction market, impressive automobile demand, and an aerospace industry poised to experience a long-term secular uptrend.” XME Allocations XME features four steelmakers among its top 10 holdings, including Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE), which accounts for 4.4 percent of the ETF's weight. S&P Capital IQ has a Strong Buy rating on Nucor, the largest U.S. steelmaker. “According to Miller, NUE's strategy to become more vertically integrated with its new Louisiana direct reduced iron plant will result in generally less volatile production costs. The new plant will enhance NUE's low-cost position in the U.S. steel industry. “For the longer term, he sees earnings rising on U.S. economic growth, strong automotive demand, and a recovery in U.S. nonresidential steel demand and better control of raw material costs. In 2016, S&P Capital IQ forecasts $3.18 in 2016, up from $1.67 in 2015, driven in part by 8 percent revenue growth,” said the research firm. XME's Catalysts XME has also recently been boosted by the resurgence of precious metals miners, as the ETF allocates a combined 23.2 percent of its weight to precious metals miners. Up nearly 13 percent over the past month, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is among the leaders of the precious metal miners ETF comeback. “GDX has $5 billion in assets and it trades on average 63 million shares on a daily basis with a $0.01 bid/ask spread,” said S&P Capital IQ. GDX is top heavy, as its top 10 holdings combine for over half the ETF's weight. Image Credit: Public Domain"
2015-10-22,October Rally Has ETF Shorts Scrambling To Cover,"So much for October's reputation as a bad month for equities. After slumping more than 7 percent in the third quarter, the S&P 500 is up nearly 5 percent this month, and this October rally has short sellers scrambling to cover bearish bets on some well-known exchange-traded funds. The October rally in equities has forced three consecutive weeks of covering in ETF short positions, reducing the shares out on borrow across scores of popular ETFs, according to research out today by S3 Partners Managing Director of Research Ihor Dusaniwsky. S3 Partners provides securities finance data and lending services to institutional investors, including hedge funds. To this point in October, traders have covered $4.1 billion in short positions in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY), the world's largest ETF. Keeping with the theme of short sellers scampering out of positions in large U.S. equity index products, shorts have also reduced bearish bets on the iShares Russell 2000 Index (ETF) (NYSE: IWM), the largest small-cap ETF, by over $500 million this month, according to S3 data. Related Link: Short Selling: Karl Loomes Shares The Six Hottest U.S.-Listed Stocks The Federal Reserve's Influence Following the Federal Reserve's decision to not raise interest rates last months, traders have also been running to cover bearish wagers against an array of interest rate-sensitive ETFs, including some of the most heavily traded corporate bond funds. The SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bnd ETF (NYSE: JNK), the second-largest junk bond ETF, has seen over $500 million in shares returned this month, while the Select Sector Financial Slct Str SPDR Fd (NYSE: XLF), SPDR KBW Regional Banking (ETF) (NYSE: KRE), iShares Barclays 7-10 Year Trasry Bnd Fd (NYSE: IEF) and the iShares iBoxx $ High Yid Corp Bond (ETF) (NYSE: HYG) have each seen between $200 million and $300 million in short positions covered in October, according to S3 data. Traders' Movements Toward Fixed-Income ETFs That jibes with data showing traders are rushing into fixed-income ETFs from the long side. To start the fourth quarter, five of the top 10 asset-gathering ETFs, including each of the top three, are fixed-income funds. Some recently high-flying ETFs are seeing increased borrows by short sellers, though in the case of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, how long shorts can ride this trade out is up for debate. GDX, the largest gold miners ETF, is up more than 22 percent over the past month, but shares out on loan in GDX have climbed $500 million in recent weeks, according to S3 data Another playing with fire short trade has been shorting the iShares MSCI Brazil Index (ETF) (NYSE: EWZ). Until recently, shorting EWZ was almost free money, but the largest Brazil ETF has surged 12.3 percent over the past month as perhaps the one catalyst that could spark the downtrodden fund is gaining momentum: Impeaching Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff. Traders are betting the momentum will not last as shares on borrow in EWZ are up $200 million, according to S3. Another ETF to watch is the Market Vectors Agribusiness (ETF) (NYSE: MOO), not because short interest is rising in the fund itself, but because bearish traders are feasting on some of MOO's largest holdings. S3 points Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) has seen $2.3 billion in new borrows in recent days ,accompanied by $500 million in new borrows for Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan (USA) (NYSE: POT). Those stocks combine for 12.2 percent of MOO's weight. Image Credit: Public Domain"

2015-11-09,Rate Hike Odds Shine A Light On Leveraged Gold Miners ETFs,"As market participants continue resetting interest rate hike expectations to reflect the notion that the Federal Reserve will increase borrowing costs following its December meeting, plenty of rate-sensitive asset classes and sectors are coming under intense scrutiny. Add commodities and commodities producers to that list, a list that most certainly includes gold and gold mining equities. The November tale of the tape for leveraged gold miners exchange-traded funds reflects the havoc traders expect will be wrought upon gold and bullion-producing companies as the Fed inches closer to higher interest rates. Commodities And Commodities Producers Coming into Monday's trading session, the top two ETFs on a month-to-date basis from Direxion's stable of bearish leveraged funds were the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: DUST)) and the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JDST)), according to issuer data. Related Link: Commodities ETFs Want To Get Back Into Your Portfolio Direxion is the second-largest issuer of inverse and leveraged ETFs. DUST and JDST entered Monday with month-to-date gains of almost 34 percent and 25.3 percent, respectively. “Tangible assets like gold tend to do well when rates are low and inflation is high. But when rates rise, investors tend to shift towards interest-bearing assets, with higher yields compared to gold. But on Friday (October 9), gold surged to a roughly six-week high the day after Fed minutes revealed caution about raising interest rates in the near term. Gold miners are inherently a leverage play on the metal. Miner stocks have been compressing for months now. But some investors think the sector may be setting up for a major multiyear move higher,” said Direxion in a recent note. Ah yes, early October. Those were the good ol' days for gold and miners ETFs. Back then, it seemed unlikely the Fed would proceed with raising interest rates this year, and the ensuing speculation to that effect elicited sharp rallies in the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT)) and the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3x Shares (Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JNUG)). The Changes A Month Can Induce Fast-forward to November and JNUG and NUGT are Direxion's two worst-performing bullish leveraged ETFs on a month-to-date basis, with losses entering Monday of 21.7 percent and 27.8 percent, respectively. Likewise, JNUG and NUGT have also been the issuer's two most volatile bullish leveraged funds over the past 30 days, according to Direxion data. Predictably, traders are once again playing a dangerous game with leveraged gold miners ETFs, as they continue applying the flawed thinking that simply because JNUG and NUGT fall on a particular day means those funds are destined to reverse course the following day. Those were Direxion's top two asset-gathering ETFs last Friday, and month-to-date, the pair have hauled in a combined $33 million in new assets. Conversely, DUST and JDST have lost a combined $53.8 million this month. Image Credit: Public Domain"

2015-12-31,Harmon: Gold On Edge Of 'Major Breakdown',"Yes, I know that Gold SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) prices have been falling for 5 years so for many of you this may not come as a news, and others of you will tell me I am late to this view. To be fair, I have talked about Gold falling for 4 of those last 5 years. But unlike Peter Schiff who recently reiterated that we will see $5000 Gold prices, I see signs in the price action showing the possibility of a major breakdown. An acceleration of the downtrend. The long term chart above shows the precipitous fall in Gold from 2012 into 2013, followed by a long steady channel lower. It is how the price of Gold may end this year in that channel that raises this possibility. Without a rally above 1075, Gold will close the year at 6 year lows and on the bottom of that channel. It has bounced before at the bottom of the channel, and it may do so again. But the candlestick print for the month of December will be the first to show some separation from the 50% retracement level of the 10 year move higher. This separation is what is troubling. Continuation would look for a move to the 61.8% Fibonacci level retracement under $900. Momentum indicators support this kind of move. Looking at just the last year shows that channel zoomed in above. The short term technicals are what are troublesome. The movement since the beginning of November has failed to push the price of Gold above the middle of the channel. The momentum indicators show a turn back lower at much lower levels than the last several tops. A much weaker bounce. In fact, no bounce. With this price action it would not surprise me to see a price of Gold under $1000 in the first quarter of 2016.

Steve Grasso is a buyer of American Eagle Outfitters (NYSE: AEO). Brian Kelly wants to sell Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (NYSE: DB).

2016-01-10,Fast Money Picks For The End Of The Year,"Tim Seymour said on CNBC's Fast Money that iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Indx (ETF) (NYSE: EEM) is oversold. He thinks that it is probably going to trade lower in the short term, but things are going to stabilize and in the long term it should do well. Seymour thinks that a long trade in iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Indx (ETF) should be profitable by the year end. He also likes its 3 percent dividend yield. David Seaburg believes that traders are going to wish they bought Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) in a year from now. He explained that the company has shown that it can monetize as mobile and it has a new cost-conscious CEO. He added that the stock is relatively inexpensive and he would buy it. Brian Kelly thinks that Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) should do well by the end of the year. He believes that interest rates are going to be negative in 2016 and gold is going to do well in a such environment. Guy Adami likes Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTN) as a long-term trade. It has a 2 percent dividend yield and it trades at a P/E of 17. The company is buying back the stock and Adami thinks that it is doing so for the right reasons."
2016-01-11,Traders Aren't Displaying Much Confidence In Leveraged Gold Miner ETFs,"Global equity markets are tumbling to start 2016, prompting investors to seek out safe-haven assets, including gold. Although gold prices fell again last year, extending bullion's bear market to a third year, volatility to start 2016 has been a boon for gold and the related exchange traded funds. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest gold ETF, is up 4.2 percent to start the year. Gold's resurgence, albeit brief to this point, is proving to be a boon for miners stocks and ETFs such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest and most heavily traded gold miners ETF. Of course, leveraged bullish miners ETFs are benefiting in significant fashion as well. Even with last Friday's loss of 7.3 percent, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) is still up more than 19 percent this month. NUGT's small-cap counterpart, the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: JNUG), lost 8.3 percent last Friday, but is still up 15.3 percent this month. Those performances are enough to make NUGT and JNUG two of Direxion's best-performing leveraged bullish ETFs this month. Despite those performances and the increased global market volatility that has increased gold's allure, traders are displaying little confidence that gold miners ETFs can extend their recent gains. To start this year, NUGT has lost nearly $20.3 million in assets while JNUG has seen $3.4 million in departures. Since gold is often viewed as a hedge against economic weakness, the strengthening U.S. economy has affected investment demand for gold, leading prices to fall. Goldminer stocks are an inherently leveraged play on gold prices. With expectations once again growing that the Fed will raise interest rates sooner rather than later, speculators are once again considering the leveraged trade on the miners, said Direxion in a recent research note. Traders' doubts about the near-term outlook for JNUG and NUGT is further highlighted by recent volume statistics. For the five-day period ending January 7, NUGT's volume was nearly 14 percent below its trailing 20-day average while JNUG so a modest volume decline over that period, according to Direxion data. Though past performances are not guarantees of future returns, a theme that has been prominent with leveraged gold miners ETFs is worth remembering. Traders have previously eschewed the leveraged gold miners ETFs that are going up in favor of the leveraged gold miners funds that are struggling. So perhaps that trend could replay itself, leading to more near-term gains for JNUG and NUGT."

Gold's resurgence, albeit brief to this point, is proving to be a boon for miners stocks and ETFs such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEArca: GDX), the largest and most heavily traded gold miners ETF. Of course, leveraged bullish miners ETFs are benefiting in significant fashion as well. Even with last Friday's loss of 7.3 percent, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSEArca: NUGT) is still up more than 19 percent this month. NUGT's small-cap counterpart, the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSEArca: JNUG), lost 8.3 percent last Friday, but is still up 15.3 percent this month. Those performances are enough to make NUGT and JNUG two of Direxion's best-performing leveraged bullish ETFs this month. Despite those performances and the increased global market volatility that has increased gold's allure, traders are displaying little confidence that gold miners ETFs can extend their recent gains. To start this year, NUGT has lost nearly $20.3 million in assets while JNUG has seen $3.4 million in departures. Since gold is often viewed as a hedge against economic weakness, the strengthening U.S. economy has affected investment demand for gold, leading prices to fall. Goldminer stocks are an inherently leveraged play on gold prices. With expectations once again growing that the Fed will raise interest rates sooner rather than later, speculators are once again considering the leveraged trade on the miners, said Direxion in a recent research note. Traders' doubts about the near-term outlook for JNUG and NUGT is further highlighted by recent volume statistics. For the five-day period ending Jan. 7, NUGT's volume was nearly 14 percent below its trailing 20-day average while JNUG so a modest volume decline over that period, according to Direxion data. Though past performances are not guarantees of future returns, a theme that has been prominent with leveraged gold miners ETFs is worth remembering. Traders have previously eschewed the leveraged gold miners ETFs that are going up in favor of the leveraged gold miners funds that are struggling. So perhaps that trend could replay itself, leading to more near-term gains for JNUG and NUGT."
2016-01-13,Gold ETFs Regain Some Luster,"A volatile start to 2016 for global equity markets has sent investors looking for safe-haven alternatives and that search is benefiting gold exchange traded products. That safe-haven ebullience is not limited to physically-backed gold exchange traded funds, such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), though GLD has been able to cobble together modest inflows to start 2016 after losing more than $5.5 billion combined in the previous two years. Rising gold prices are prompting investors revisit gold miners equities and the related ETFs, though funds such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) remain locked in long-term bear markets. “Increased market volatility that unseated equity markets in the opening weeks of 2016 have seen commodities stage a bit of a comeback, evidenced by the recent uptick in gold prices. In fact, gold is currently outperforming most global equity indices off the starting gate,” according to a recent Markit note. Still, traders have remained apprehensive when it comes to gold miners ETFs. As of January 11, GDX and GDXJ had taken in any new money this year, though neither ETF experienced outflows, either. Likewise, traders have taken a tepid approach to leveraged gold miners ETFs. On Monday, however, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT), the bullish triple-leveraged answer to GDX, added $26.2 million in new assets while the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST), the leveraged bearish answer to GDX, lost $15.2 million in assets, according to Direxion data. “Resurgence in appetite towards gold has also seen sentiment towards its miners improve. Average short interest across global gold miners, with at least $100m in market cap, has fallen sharply recently, down by 21% to 3.6% of shares outstanding since early 2015. This contrasts with the average short interest of the S&P 500 which is at the highest level seen in over three years,” notes Markit. There is a rub with that short interest data. Short interest data is often viewed as a contrarian indicator, meaning that elevated short interest is seen as a bullish sign because the more forced covering that takes place, the more heavily shorted security rises. Translation: Dwindling short interest in gold miners could imply limited near-term upside for miners ETFs. “While the rise in gold price is positive for the industry, some US based or operating mines will need higher price increases magnitudes to improve their prospects and offset the impact of a stronger local currency,” adds Markit."
2016-01-19,Gold Stocks Are Hitting Their Lowest Levels. Ever.,"A popular gold equity index closed at the lowest level in its 30-year history last week. It has been a rough ride for gold bugs in recent years. We have written about gold’s slide on numerous occasions. An even sadder tale, though, has been that of equities whose business is based on the precious metal. Gold stocks have been mercilessly beaten down since their top in late 2010. In 5 years, these shares have lost over 80% of their value, based on the oldest gauge of the sector, the PHLX Gold And Silver Sector Index (NASDAQINDEX:XAU). In particular over the past year, we have documented milestone after dubious milestone on the part of gold stocks. Today’s “achievement” takes the cake, however. The XAU closed today at 41.52. Since its inception in 1983, that is the lowest close ever in this index. Now, this is not a piece aimed at kicking gold bugs when they are down. Markets are tough and any ill-intentioned sentiments are out of line (not to mention, hecklers are sure to be humbled, themselves, at some point in this “game”.) There is a lesson here, though. As a money management firm, our investment philosophy at JLFMI has always centered around actively managing risk. This includes our investment selection. The sectors, assets, etc. in which we choose to invest are determined by a quantitative model designed to detect areas of relative strength. That is, we want to be in areas that are going up, and faster than the rest of the market. Furthermore, when that relative strength fades, we want to be disciplined enough to get out of those areas and move on to something else. Now, in our history, there has been one exception (that I can recall) to this philosophy. In 2010, we decided to take a small “core” position in gold (the metal, not the equities). We sympathized with the longer-term bullish thesis for the precious metal (and still do). For awhile, it was working out well. Then the trend began to turn south. In 2013, the bullish trend was decidedly broken. Yet, we continued to maintain at least part of this core position. Mistake. Last year, we finally jettisoned the last portion of the gold position. Not because the thesis had changed, but because the trend had. And it had changed long before. But for the first time in our history, we ignored the truth that is price. Everything cycles up and down and, indeed, that is at the core of our investment philosophy. But for fear of missing out on the “big one” or being without the black swan hedge, we ignored that for awhile. So we do sympathize with gold bugs and their longer-term thesis, but we also (re)learned a valuable lesson. The point of an actively-managed strategy is that, should the “big one” hit, we will be there to catch it, because the asset will be going up. And just as importantly, when the trend turns down, the strategy is there to protect us from remaining invested – especially in assets hitting all-time lows. ________ This was originally shared on Dana Lyons' Tumblr More from Dana Lyons, JLFMI and My401kPro.

2016-02-04,Gold Futures Keep On Rallying,"April Gold futures are trading higher by $13.30 at $1154.70 per ounce in Thursday's session. It is trading higher for the third day in a row and for the fourth time in its last five sessions. After a higher open, it retreated and found support under Wednesday's close ($1141.30), reaching $1139.70 before turning higher. The ensuing rally took the bullion to $1157.30 before falling back to its current level. That marks the highest level for the rolling front-month contract since it peaked on October 29 at $1162.60."
2016-02-04,Leveraged Miners ETF Struts Its Stuff,"Investors have been looking for safe-haven assets since the start of 2016, and that is leading them to gold. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), the largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund in the world, is up 8.91 percent year-to-date. Gold Rallies Galore GLD's strong start to the year has been enough to illicit rallies in gold mining stocks and ETFs such as the previously downtrodden Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). GDX, as it often does in either direction, is overshooting GLD's 2016 move higher with a year-to-date gain of 18.51 percent. The solid start to 2016 for GDX comes after the largest gold miners ETF lost 24.7 percent last year and 12.4 percent in 2014. Related Link: Gold ETFs Regain Some Luster Predictably, good things for GLD and GDX are turning into great things for the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT)). All NUGT has done to start the year is surge more than 55.07 percent. “From a technical perspective, NUGT is trending higher, picking up momentum. The RSI as a gauge of short-term momentum continues to trend upwards, well above the generally accepted trend level of 50. In the past 30 days, 57.14 percent of the daily returns have been positive. The MACD signal is slightly above the signal line here, and trending towards the zero line. A more supportive uptrend may be probable should it move above the zero line,” according to Direxion Leveraged & Inverse ETF Quantitative Research. NUGT And DUST During gold's bear market, which started in 2013, catching rallies in GDX and NUGT has been a trying endeavor. However, when it comes to NUGT, a data point that has been previously highlighted in this space has proven helpful. When traders flock to NUGT's bearish equivalent, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: DUST)), that scenario can be a prelude to more upside for NUGT. Good news for traders involved with NUGT: Traders allocated $27.6 million to DUST on February 2, more new money than was added to any other leveraged Direxion on that day, according to issuer data. Other data points confirm traders' reluctance to embrace NUGT despite its recently impressive showing. For the five days ending February 2, NUGT's volume was more than 10 percent below the trailing 20-day average and over the past month, the ETF's average daily flows activity was negative, meaning traders were departing the fund, according to Direxion data.

2016-02-09,"3 Reasons You Shouldn't Wait for $1,000 Gold","Don’t wait for gold to hit $1,000. Why? Because it may not happen. And even if it does, $1,000—or any price tag in your mind—won’t guarantee the actual bottom. The biggest risk is that you don’t pull the trigger at all. It’s not supposed to be this way, but buying or selling an investment is usually an emotional thing. Let’s be honest, if gold hits $1,000 and everything you read is negative—the downtrend remains strong, TV pundits project $900, and even some gold bugs admit it could go lower—would you really buy? Most would hold off out of fear it might go lower. Almost every article I read in 2015 said gold was headed to at least $1,000 by year end. Downward momentum was strong, press coverage was very negative, and I was hard pressed to find one price projection that wasn’t lower. But it didn’t happen. I’m not saying we won’t hit $1,000. I’m saying the crowd is usually wrong. And that investors are usually too emotional. I’m also saying that $1,000 is a tad too convenient… Many investors think prices tend to hit big round numbers, and many projections are made around them. But when it comes to gold, that hasn’t been the case… ➢ In the mania of late 1979/early 1980, most investors believed the gold price would soar $1,000. It never did (until 38+ years later). ➢ In 1976, most investors assumed gold would fall to $100. I read newspaper articles that showed many pundits believed it was a foregone conclusion. The reasons were similar to today—a strong downtrend, negative press, and lack of upward momentum in spite of catalysts. But gold never touched $100 again. The lowest it got was $104 on August 31 of that year, roughly 4% above where everyone assumed it would land. That may not sound like a big difference, but the point is that all those bids at $100 never got filled. Everyone waiting for $100 was left high and dry. And check this out: that 4% difference is, so far, the same as today—gold’s low point was $1,049 on December 17, 2015, also roughly 4% away from the prevailing $1,000 assumption. ➢ In the spring of 2001, most investors were convinced gold’s bear market would continue, assuming the price would fall to at least $250, if not $200. Not just because downward momentum was strong, but also because it was heading into the weak summer months after the end of a seasonally strong period. But gold never reached $250 and instead bottomed at $255.95. It left all those bids at $250 unfulfilled and those investors waiting for $200, confused and scrambling. ➢ In 2011, most gold bulls assumed the price would hit $2,000 (I admit I was one of them). But the closest it ever got was $1,921, also 4% shy of the big round number and everyone’s assumption. Again, I don’t guarantee gold won’t hit $1,000. But history shows that big round numbers haven’t always represented major turning points. In addition to this history, there are some compelling arguments that suggest gold’s low is indeed in and that you should buy now. Or at least follow the strategy I outline at the end. So, why shouldn’t you wait for a $1,000 gold price? #1. Because History Says Gold Will Be Up This Year Through 2015, the gold price has fallen three consecutive years. The last time this happened was from 1996 to 1998. And since becoming legal to own again in 1975… Notice how the gold price performed after the only time it fell three consecutive years: it was up for five straight years. Investor Message: Odds are that gold breaks its downtrend and ends 2016 higher. From a historical perspective, this means that buying gold now is a low-risk proposition. #2. Because Gold Bears Have Lost Interest Short interest on gold has been high since 2013. But that’s changing. The number of bearish bets on GLD (SPDR Gold Shares, the largest gold ETF) have plummeted. Through December 2015, the put-to-call ratio is now at its lowest level since 2008. In other words, many investors that have been bearish have closed out their bets. They see less opportunity to make money from a falling gold price. Investor Message: With fewer bearish bets, the gold price has less downward pressure. #3. Because Successful Hedge Funds Are Buying It hasn’t been widely reported, but some big-name hedge fund managers are gold bulls… Stanley Druckenmiller, Duquesne Family Office, former chief strategist for George Soros: at the end of the third quarter in 2015, he owned 2.9 million shares of GLD, one of the 10 largest holders of the fund. John Paulson, Paulson and Company: his company has owned gold for many years, and its current position consists of 9.2 million shares of GLD. At $1,000 gold, that’s about $920 million! Ray Dalio, Bridgewater Associates: He allocates 7.5% of the fund’s portfolio to gold. He also owns shares in Newmont Mining, Barrick Gold, and Goldcorp. David Einhorn, Greenlight Capital: Like Paulson, he’s owned gold for several years. He also owns six million shares of GDX, the gold miners ETF. Carl Icahn, Icahn Enterprises: it disclosed last August that it owns 8.5% of gold and copper producer Freeport-McMoRan. Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital: He’s owned gold for at least several years. He also stated earlier this month that not only has gold hit a bottom, but that it’s poised to surge 30% this year (from its then price of $1,090). The article noted that, “Gundlach was one of the first to predict the sharp oil price crash in the fall of 2014 and then the junk bond turbulence of 2015,” so his opinion is worth listening to. These are some of the most successful hedge funds in the world and they apparently aren’t worried about the possibility of gold falling to $1,000. Investor Message: Some large funds and successful money managers are betting big on gold right now. It’s not because they think gold won’t fall to $1,000; it’s because the need to own gold right now far outweighs the possibility of it falling another 4%. There Is a Way to Minimize the Risk… Whether you think gold’s bottom is behind us or not, understand your risk. If it does reach $1,000—and that’s a big if at this point—the temptation to stay on the sidelines will be great. And if it doesn’t fall to $1,000, similar to the historical examples above, you’d be forced to buy gold at a higher price. There is a more effective way to invest… Until recently, you couldn’t really dollar-cost average your gold purchases unless you drove to the dealer every month or mailed a check to your favorite web dealer every time you got paid. Not very convenient, and as a result most people don’t do it consistently. But now you can. Once you open an account through the Hard Assets Alliance and sign up for the MetalStream service, you can automatically purchase gold (or silver) every month. No monthly reminder notes required. This way you don’t need to worry about whether the bottom is in. If it isn’t, you’ll get more ounces for your investment dollars. If it is, you’re already in. Remember, gold is not a short-term investment. We’re not playing a “turnaround” story or speculating on some stock going higher. Gold is a core part of a diversified portfolio that offers crisis protection you can’t get elsewhere and is uncorrelated to the stock market (i.e., gold tends to rise when the stock market falls). It’s your own personal hedge against any event or trend that could impact your standard of living. That’s worth owning, regardless of the risk of a 4% decline. I suggest that we stop worrying about whether gold will hit $1,000 and invest now."
2016-02-11,Gold Is In The Spotlight; Marc Cuban Thinks It Could Be A 'Safe Haven',"Gold stocks surged on Thursday after the Fed's Janet Yellen hinted that negative interest rates could be a possibility - in theory, at least. We haven't finished the evaluation, Yellen said during a questioning period on Capital Hill. I wouldn't take [them] off the table. U.S. gold for delivery in April surged more than 5 percent on Thursday while spot gold gained more than 4.5 percent. Investors are concerned that central banks' solution (is) negative interest rates or at least not raising rates - and that is gold friendly, Matthew Turner of Macquarie told CNBC. The key risk to gold is that the U.S. economy manages to put in a good performance, like it did last year. Shares of SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) hit a new 52-week high of $120.83 on Thursday and was higher by more than 4 percent on the day. Investors and traders appear to be more bullish on gold miners rather than the commodity itself as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) gained more than 6 percent. Traders who anticipated a strong move in the gold miners and properly used leveraged ETFs to their advantage saw large gains. Shares of Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSE: NGT) were higher by nearly 20 percent. The ETF offers a 3x exposure to the NYSE Arca GoldMiners Index. On the other hand, Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X ETF (NYSE: DUST) plunged by 20 percent as the ETF offers a 3x inverse exposure to the GoldMiners Index. Mark Cuban: Gold Is A 'Safe Haven' According to CNBC, billionaire investor and entrepreneur Mark Cuban posted on the social platform Cyber Dust that he acquired a lot of call options on gold. He suggested that an investment in gold is not a hedge on other investments but investors looking for momentum could push the commodity higher."

2016-03-22,Bullion And Gold ETFs Get A Boost From The Federal Reserve,"Last week, the Federal Reserve opted against boosting interest rates, leaving many market participants feeling that the odds of the central bank raising borrowing costs four times this year, as many thought would be the case heading into 2016, are rapidly dwindling. The Fed kept its rate target at 0.25 to 0.5 percent and cut its expected target for the end of the year. The FOMC indicated they would likely raise interest rates only twice this year, down from earlier projections of four increases, bringing their rate expectations closer to most market analysts, said Direxion in a recent note. Two Fed interest rates seems to be the order of the day now. The fewer the rate hikes, the better for gold as bullion has already proven to start the year. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) gold, (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest bullion-backed exchange traded fund is up 17.2 percent year-to-date, a performance few non-leveraged ETFs can match. Related Link: A Post-Fed ETF Idea No ETF can match the more than $6 billion in new assets added by GLD. That is more than twice as much as the second-best asset-gathering ETF this year. However, the 17.2 percent delivered by GLD seems piddly compared to gold miners ETFs, such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX).

2016-03-22,"Fed Boosts Bullion, Gold ETFs","Last week, the Federal Reserve opted against boosting interest rates, leaving many market participants feeling that the odds of the central bank raising borrowing costs four times this year, as many thought would be the case heading into 2016, are rapidly dwindling. “The Fed kept its rate target at 0.25 to 0.5 percent and cut its expected target for the end of the year. The FOMC indicated they would likely raise interest rates only twice this year, down from earlier projections of four increases, bringing their rate expectations closer to most market analysts,” said Direxion in a recent note. Two Fed interest rates seems to be the order of the day now. The fewer the rate hikes, the better for gold as bullion has already proven to start the year. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest bullion-backed exchange traded fund is up 17.2 percent year-to-date, a performance few non-leveraged ETFs can match. No ETF can match the more than $6 billion in new assets added by GLD. That is more than twice as much as the second-best asset-gathering ETF this year. However, the 17.2 percent delivered by GLD seems piddly compared to gold miners ETFs, such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX).

2016-04-11,What's Going On With Gold?,"Gold futures continued trading higher early Monday morning and reached its highest levels in almost three weeks. Bloomberg attributed the commodity's gains to a weak U.S. dollar and cautious commentary from the Federal Reserve regarding an interest rate hike. Meanwhile, European governments bonds continue offering negative yields. Gold ETFs Shares of SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) were higher by 1 percent Monday morning at $119.61 – within striking reach of its 52-week high of $122.37.

Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank A/S in Denmark told Bloomberg that gold's gain is attributed to the weakness in the U.S. dollar.

2016-04-11,Is China Becoming An Even Bigger Player In The World's Gold Market?,"China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of gold, may be expanding its presence in the international gold market. According to a new story by the Wall Street Journal, low gold prices in recent years have driven a new wave of international gold asset acquisitions by Chinese companies. Sprott Asset Management CEO Peter Grosskopf says China’s five or six gold companies are all better-positioned financially than their North American counterparts. “I have been in touch with all of them, and they all have plans for increasing assets overseas,” Grosskopf says. Related Link: Oil Prices Jump 6% On Surprise U.S. Drawdown, But World Bank Sees Limited Upside In 2016 Gold isn’t the only international asset that Chinese companies have shown a growing interest in recently. Chinese companies have already acquired a combined $92 billion in international assets so far in 2016. That total doesn’t include Anbang Insurance Group’s recently-withdrawn $14 billion bid for Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc (NYSE: HOT), which would have been the largest Chinese takeover of a U.S. company in history. China already produces an estimated 1,000 tons of gold annually and consumes around 450 tons. China’s gold production accounts for about 30 percent of the world’s demand.

Gold for June delivery rose 1.09 percent to $1,257.30. Regression analysis suggests a -0.5% real rate would imply a $1,380/oz gold price and a -1.0% real rate $1,546/oz. Currently, we would calculate this real rate proxy as -34bp, which implies a gold price of $1,326/oz, analyst Tyler Broda wrote in a note. Broda continued, The recent dovish turn by the FOMC following significant global volatility in January and February has left the path for rate hikes in 2016 much more uncertain. As US inflation re-emerges, after a long period of dormancy, the potential for even moderate inflation to push real rates lower could have a significant positive impact on gold investment rates. The potential for inflation rates to move upwards and match US Treasury yields, which continue to be held down in the short-term, could create a 1970s-esque phase in real rates, in which our analysis suggests could move gold prices higher from here, the analyst highlighted. However, Broda noted the yellow metal is unlikely to trace out a straight line path with current volatility. We see near-term positioning as unfavorable (following Q1) and global deflationary pressures, specifically from China, continue to weigh on world markets. But the falling opportunity cost of owning gold in a falling real rate environment, should it develop again, could provide the potential for higher rates of gold investment and higher gold prices over the long-term, Broda added."

2016-04-19,How Overpriced Is Gold Right Now?,"Gold for June delivery rose 1.73 percent to $1,256.40 an ounce on failed Doha deal that would have cut the output at January levels. Investors are flocking to the gold due to its safe-haven status. Is gold valued more than its worth? According to a study by Campbell Harvey and Claude Erb, the real price of gold is currently high compared to history. Gold has been described as an inflation hedge, a golden constant, with a long run real return of zero. Yet over 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 year investment horizons the variation in the nominal and real returns of gold has not been driven by realized inflation, the study says. In addition, an industry expert feels that the yellow metal is overpriced by 33 percent. Related Link: StreetSweeper's Short Thesis On Almaden: Stock Is 'Fool's Gold' Gold's fair value is a third less than where it's trading today: $824 an ounce, to be exact, not the market price of $1,235, Mark Hulbert wrote in a MarketWatch column. Unless inflation is a lot higher than what the bond market is discounting, and assuming Harvey and Erb's model is right, gold's fair value will exert a gravitational pull on gold's price that eventually will bring its price down a lot lower than where it stands today, Hulbert added. Meanwhile, RBC recently increased its forecast for gold prices for 2016 to $1,250/oz and from 2017 onwards to $1,300/oz and maintained a favorable long-term stance on the commodity.

2016-04-25,A Different Type Of Gold Miners ETF,"It is not a secret that gold and silver miners exchange-traded funds are topping their physically-backed counterparts in significant fashion this year. For example, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is up about 65 percent year-to-date, or more than triple the returns offered by the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD). Sprott Gold Miners ETF Nearly all of the top 10 non-leveraged ETFs in terms of year-to-date performance are gold or silver miners funds, a group that includes the Sprott Gold Miners ETF (ALPS ETF Trust (NYSE: SGDM)). SGDM, which is nearly two years old, represents a different approach to gold miners ETFs, most of which are traditional cap-weighted funds. Related Link: How Overpriced Is Gold Right Now? SGDM's underlying index “seeks to emphasize gold stocks with the highest quarterly revenue growth measured on a year-over-year basis and stronger relative balance sheets as measured by long-term debt to equity,” according to Sprott. “The Index aims to track the performance of large to mid-capitalization publically traded gold companies that are listed on major U.S. exchanges. The Index uses a transparent, rules-based methodology that is designed to identify 25 gold stocks with the highest historical beta to the spot price of gold, with each stock’s weighting in the Index adjusted based on its quarterly revenue growth on a year-over-year basis and the quality of its balance sheet, as measured by long-term debt to equity,” according to a statement issued by Sprott. SGDM's Methodological Success The methodology is working, as SGDM is higher by 66.4 percent year-to-date. However, a potential concern for investors looking to avoid stock-specific risk is that SGDM's top three holdings – Franco Nevada Corp (NYSE: FNV), Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (USA) (NYSE: AEM) and Goldcorp Inc. (USA) (NYSE: GG) – combine for about 41 percent of the ETF's weight. No other stock garners a weight of more than 5.1 percent in SGDM's lineup. When SGDM came to market, its top three holdings represented 46 percent of its weight. A variety of reasons have been cited as catalysts for the 2016 bullion bounce. Negative interest throughout the developed world and the Federal Reserve appearing as though it will not be able to raise U.S. borrowing costs by as much as previously thought are chief among those reasons. For gold bugs, there is nothing wrong with safe-haven demand and 2016's market action is, to this pointing, reminding investors of gold's utility. In fact, gold has proven its mettle during market crises ranging from the Soviet sovereign debt crisis to the Long Term Capital Management meltdown to the global financial crisis."

2016-05-05,It's Not Surprising What's Boosting Gold Miners ETFs,"This is how things are going for gold exchange-traded funds this year. Physically-backed ETFs, such as the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), have been good. Gold mining ETFs have been better. A lot better. For example, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), is up 73.1 percent year-to-date, a performance that is about three and a half times better than GLD's performance. Further underscoring the strength of gold miners ETFs this year is this anecdote: Of the top 11 non-leveraged ETFs on a year-to-date basis, nine are either gold or silver miners ETFs. Of the remaining two ETFs, one is a mining and materials fund heavy on gold miners. The other is the iShares MSCI All Peru Capped Index Fund (NYSE: EPU). Peru is a major producer of gold and one of the world's largest silver-producing countries. Also on that list is the iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners ETF (iShares Inc. (NYSE: RING)), which is higher by a dumbfounding 86.13 percent this year. Related Link: Poll: Analysts See More Upside For Gold, Silver Where This Success Originates Sometimes, investors are obsessed with the “why” behind big moves, such as those being notched by ETFs like RING. Fortunately, the answer is not hard: Thank global central banks, including the Federal Reserve. “At the same time, gold has benefited from central bank policies and the level of real interest rates (in other words, the interest rate after inflation.) According to Bloomberg data, gold has typically performed best in environments in which real interest rates were low to negative [...] We are seeing stark examples of this with the current environment of negative interest rates in Japan and many parts of Europe,” said BlackRock in a recent note. Last month, the Federal Reserve opted against boosting interest rates, leaving many market participants feeling that the odds of the central bank raising borrowing costs four times this year, as many thought would be the case heading into 2016, are rapidly dwindling. The $125.5 million RING devotes over 24 percent of its combined weight to just two stocks – Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE: ABX) and Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE: NEM). However, there is more to the story with gold miners and the relevant ETFs. The Story Continues “The MSCI Global Gold Miners Index has rallied an incredible 76 percent this year, but much of the performance is due to the recovery in valuations: According to Bloomberg data, gold miner stocks were battered last year, with the index down 45 percent from its 2015 high. Now the stocks are not as attractive. At the same time, real rates have historically had little to no impact on equity returns,” according to BlackRock."
2016-05-11,Paul Singer Says The Gold Rally Is Just Beginning,"Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Singer bets big on gold due to global currency debasing, but Goldman sees losses for the yellow metal, according to a report on Bloomberg. Bloomberg said gold for immediate delivery surged 16 percent in the first quarter, the biggest quarterly surge since 1986, as the Federal Reserve avoided tightening and central banks in Europe and Japan pressed on with negative interest rates. Meanwhile, the report also recalled that billionaire investor Stan Druckenmiller said last week gold is his largest currency allocation and the bull market in stocks was exhausted. It makes a great deal of sense to own gold. Other investors may be finally starting to agree, Bloomberg said citing Singer's April 28 letter to clients. Investors have increasingly started processing the fact that the world's central bankers are completely focused on debasing their currencies. Related Link: Goldman: 2 Upgrades, 2 Downgrades For Gold Miners If investors' confidence in central bankers' judgment continues to weaken, the effect on gold could be very powerful, Singer added. We believe the March quarter's price action could represent something closer to the beginning of such a move than to the end. However, a recent report from Goldman Sachs contradicts Singer's view. A note from the brokerage shows that it still expects weaker gold prices over the next 12 months. Goldman's new forecasts put bullion at $1,200 an ounce in three months, $1,180 in six and $1,150 in a year, up from $1,100, $1,050 and $1,000. There's limited room for further gains as the Fed will probably tighten in September, and may move in July, Bloomberg reported. At the time of writing, gold for June delivery rose $13.20, or 1.04 percent, to $1,278.00. The commodity has been trading in the range of $1,266.30 - $1,280.80 during the day."

Obviously, not all low volatility ETFs are mirror images of each other, but, along with financial services, some combination of the aforementioned sectors is often found in low volatility ETFs. Let's Look At USMV Not surprisingly, higher beta sectors such as energy and materials usually garner only scant allocations in popular reduced volatility strategies.

This is where things get really interesting. The Interesting Thing “At some point if volatility picks up and shares are sold from this holding ETF then Newmont will also be sold proportionally,” said Rareview Macro founder Neil Azous in a note out Wednesday. “We are not that smart but implied volatility on Newmont is 49 and it's been realizing between 50 and 70 over the last 10-100 days.” Azous rightfully questions whether or not a stock like Newmont should really be a low volatility ETF's top holding, though to be fair, AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) is not far behind Newmont on USMV's roster. There is a scenario where USMV could become a thorn in GDX's side. Imagine market volatility rises, but investors finally return to the dollar as a safe-haven rather than gold. Gold and gold miners fall, leading to a spike in volatility for Newmont and other mining stocks, forcing USMV to sell or significantly trim its Newmont exposure.

2016-05-16,Are Central Bankers To Thank For The Surge In Gold Prices?,"Several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that hold gold have surged by a quarter in recent memory. The reason for the rise in gold prices? Central banks — at least according to a report by Bloomberg. Bloomberg noted that gold has been 2016's best performing major metal after silver due to rising concerns over negative interest rates in Europe and Japan, and ongoing uncertainty surrounding a U.S. Federal Reserve tightening of its rates. Related Link: Gold Pops And Drops Firstly, the negative interest rate environment and quantitative-easing policies are reducing the pool of suitable investment options, and making gold less costly to hold, Bernard Aw, a strategist at IG Asia Pte told Bloomberg. Second, lingering fears of competitive currency devaluations and potentially fresh bouts of market volatility encourage safe-haven demand. Aw also noted that even if the Fed raises its interest rates, the prevailing rates will still remain very low. Meanwhile, billionaire investor Paul Singer suggested that the rally in gold has just begun. The manager of Elliott Management told his clients last month that if investors' confidence in central banks across the world continues to weaken, then the effect on gold could be very powerful. Finally, central banks and governments across the world are large buyers of gold. Bloomberg cited a report from the World Gold Council, which suggests that nations could buy up to 600 tones of gold this year, compared with 566.3 tons last year."

2016-06-08,An Obvious Catalyst For Gold ETFs,"The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest bullion-backed exchange traded product, has hauled in over $9.3 billion in new assets this year. That is nearly $4 billion more than the next closes ETF. There are several reasons why GLD and rival gold ETFs have regained investors' favor this year, including still low interest rates in the U.S. and lower or even negative rates throughout the developed world. While not the garden variety interest rate policy, negative interest rate policies (NIRP) are having a profound, mostly positive effect on gold. Raising Rates Although it appears unlikely the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month and the same can probably be said of July, the Fed is intent on boosting borrowing costs. Even it does, U.S. interest rates will still be nowhere to close to historical norms, indicating any punishment delivered to gold ETFs in the wake of rate hikes could be short-lived. Additionally, it looks like NIRP will remain throughout much of the developed world. Related Link: A History Lesson With Gold ETFs “Negative sovereign debt yields in Switzerland and Japan extend out to 10 years, while those in France and Germany are negative out to five years. Even interest rates in the US and UK are extremely low across the curve, with up to 2-year debt yielding less than 1%,” according to the World Gold Council. “In real terms, the picture is even bleaker. Only yields in the UK are positive for maturities shorter than 3 years and just a few long-term sovereign bonds yield more than 1%.” New Assets As is often the case when bullion and ETFs such as GLD get on a torrid pace and start hauling in billions of dollars in new assets, concerns are rising that gold's recent rebound is too much of a good thing, and there are plenty of naysayers willing to chime in with a bearish bullion view. Gold often falls out of favor when investors chase stocks when stocks are hot, but popular equity-based broad market ETFs are dithering this year. Gold offers further enticement as a whopping $8 trillion in global investment-grade sovereign debt currently sports negative yields, meaning investors that make those bets will lose money. The World Gold Council adds 40 percent of global sovereign debt sports yields below one percent. “While low rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, negative interest rates magnify this. Under NIRP, it now costs little, if anything, from an opportunity cost perspective, to hold gold. This could drive gold demand,” said the World Gold Council."

2016-06-20,"A Bold, Bearish Call On Gold Miners","It's nice when markets perform as expected. That's what's happening with gold and gold miners stocks and exchange traded funds this year. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest gold-backed ETF, is up 22 percent this year. That has spurred the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, to a year-to-date gain of 88 percent. With GDX up that much, it should not be surprising that the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST) is down nearly 94 percent and was recently reverse split 1-for-10. Traders that have had the fortitude to hold on to DUST's bullish counterpart, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT), have been rewarded to the tune of a four-bagger, meaning NUGT has more than quadrupled this year. In other words, it has been wrong to bet against gold miners, at least to this point in the year and calls to do that have been misplaced. However, the time could be right to consider a short-term play on DUST. “It is safe to say that the vast majority of fast money and day traders who traffic in the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX), or any levered Gold Miner ETF, do not have a strong grasp of arithmetic when it comes to the probabilities of super-forecasting the Fed hiking cycle,” said Rareview Macro founder Neil Azous in a recent note. Related Link: A History Lesson With Gold ETFs Gold and gold miners have been supported by the rash of negative interest rate policies throughout the developed and the Federal Reserve's reluctance to raise interest rates this year. Further underscoring the strength of gold miners ETFs this year is this anecdote: Of the top 11 non-leveraged ETFs on a year-to-date basis, nine are either gold or silver miners ETFs. However, there is Brexit risk for gold, as in if Great Britain opts to remain in the European Union, there is some downside risk for bullion. “If there is no Brexit, gold will likely fall $50-75 as it enters its weakest period of the year seasonally. We would expect GDX to outperform on the downside if that were to happen,” adds Azous. Although DUST is the second-worst of Direxion's inverse leveraged ETFs on a month-to-date basis, traders are preparing for the ETF to rally. DUST has averaged over $4 million per day in inflows over the past month, according to Direxion data."

2016-06-24,A Golden Side Of The Gold Miners Trade,"If conventional wisdom served to investors prior to the Brexit vote proves accurate, gold's go-go days should continue because at the time of this writing late Thursday night, the BBC is projecting Britons voted in favor of Great Britain leaving the European Union. Not surprisingly, global equity futures and the British pound plunged while safe havens, such as gold and the Japanese yen rallied. So it wouldn't be surprising to see a small amount of equity-based exchange traded funds end the week in the green. Chances are that thin will group will funds such as the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). As has been widely documented, miners and ETFs such as GDX and GDXJ are making major comebacks this year. GDX and GDXJ, the two largest gold miners ETFs, are up 83.8 percent and 107.1 percent, year-to-date, respectively. Related Link: All Big Banks Cleared Stress Test Bar For Cap. Requirements Although it appears unlikely the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month and the same can probably be said of July, the Fed is intent on boosting borrowing costs. Even it does, U.S. interest rates will still be nowhere to close to historical norms, indicating any punishment delivered to gold ETFs in the wake of rate hikes could be short-lived. Additionally, it looks like NIRP will remain throughout much of the developed world. Obviously, gold miners are getting a lift this year from rising bullion prices, but investors should also acknowledge the improving financial positions of some of the companies found in GDX and GDXJ. During the worst days of golds bear market, many gold miners trimmed fat, opting to pare production and shore balance sheets. “Despite this rally in the price of gold and the higher cash flows that come with it, it is encouraging that the management teams of the gold miners with whom we have recently met remain firmly committed to growing profitability and returns rather than production,” according to VanEck. Gold offers further enticement as a whopping $8 trillion in global investment-grade sovereign debt currently sports negative yields, meaning investors that make those bets will lose money. The World Gold Council adds 40 percent of global sovereign debt sports yields below one percent. We heard more than once in our discussions that a new ounce of production is only good, and will only be added, if it improves or maintains the existing per ounce profitability of the company. Their initiatives have slowly and cautiously started to shift from mere survival to thriving. But caution remains the name of the game,” adds VanEck."
2016-07-06,Gold Surges To Multi-Year High On A 'Perfect Storm' Of Factors,"The price of an ounce of gold continued to rise Wednesday morning and is now trading at its highest levels since 2014. An ounce of gold for August delivery was trading at $1,358.70, while the most commonly used exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of gold, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) was trading higher by 1.14 percent at $130.95, which is above its previous 52-week high of $129.58. The SPDR Gold Trust ETF has now gained more than 2 percent over the past five days, nearly 9 percent over the past month and is higher by more than 27 percent since the start of 2016. Related Link: Reasons Why This Gold Miners ETF Can Keep Soaring The Wall Street Journal cited Bob Haberkorn, a senior market strategist at RJP Futures, said investor appetite for the commodity has surged as of late due to a perfect storm of factors. Specifically, investors continue pouring money into investments and assets they consider to be a safe haven and the ongoing fallout from the Brexit voting results. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank could be preparing a new stimulus package. Investors are also attracted to gold, which can offer investors an equal or superior return to low-bond yields in the current low interest rate environment. However, consensus of a continued rise in the price of gold isn't unanimously shared among analysts. The Wall Street Journal quoted analysts at Commerzbank who said in a research note that there is now considerable correction potential as the price of gold has risen too high and too quickly.

Abraham Trading Company's Salem Abraham joined Wednesday's PreMarket Prep to give his bullish outlook for the gold and silver markets. Abraham noted that gold and silver are two things on which his company is most confident. Gold and silver are our most exciting positions. We've been long gold and silver for a couple months now, and as they've flowed back and forth but they continue to run up this year, he said. We think with the strength they've shown what you find is a market that can defy gravity. Related Link: Glistening Gold: JPMorgan Upgrades Harmony Gold, Gold Fields; Downgrades DRDGOLD Abraham added that his models have been quite bullish on the two commodities as well. We have models from one-week outlook out to up to four months, and what's interesting to me as a technical trader is that all those (models) agree to gold and silver, and that's pretty rare, he said. From a technical perspective you have a lot of opinions that say, ‘Hey these markets are going higher.' Abraham further commented that gold and silver may be the safest plays in an increasingly risky market. I think in a market environment where there's a global pushback it seems like, prudent fiscal policies across the globe from a political standpoint, there's a lot of uncertainty, he said. When you've got a currency that basically interest rates are so low to negative — which is crazy — it's as crazy as it gets for paper money. I think that's the real attraction of gold and silver right now. Major markets are soaring, and Salem Abraham has a very positive position on where gold and futures are headed in the future. The sky's the limit for markets like that. For more trading ideas and insight on the markets check out PreMarket Prep LIVE every morning from 8-9:30 a.m. ET here.

2016-08-11,Gold ETF Fever: Investors Have It,"U.S. equities reside near all-time lows. Treasury yields rest near historic lows and the Federal Reserve has yet to raise interest rates this year. In other words, 2016 has been a pretty year for equities and fixed income exchange traded funds, but gold ETFs are thrashing both of those asset classes. Year-to-date, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest bullion-backed exchange traded product, is higher by 26.7 percent. That is nearly double the combined year-to-date returns of an S&P 500 tracking ETF and the largest bond ETF. Gold ETFs such as GLD and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) don't pay dividends and there is no yield as there is on a bond fund, meaning capital appreciation is the only way investors in these products are compensated for taking on gold market risk. With the dollar weak and trillions of dollars (and rising) worth of negative-yielding sovereign debt throughout the developed world, a perfect storm for gold has been brewing for gold this year. Data suggest investors are taking note. “With global interest rates remaining low and macroeconomic concerns staying high following the Brexit vote, investors sought out gold-related investments in the first seven months of 2016. A variety of exchange traded funds that directly invest in the commodity, as well as mining companies that are highly exposed to gold prices, have been a major beneficiary,” said S&P Capital IQ in a note out Wednesday. As the research firm notes, GLD ended July with $41 billion in assets under management after packing on $13 billion in new assets through the first seven months of the year. Year-to-date, investors have added $13.1 billion to GLD, or $4.5 billion more than the second-best ETF on an asset-gathering basis has taken in. IAU and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) have added $2.69 billion and $609.1 million, respectively, in new assets. One reason the S&P 500 is lagging gold by such a substantial margin this year is gold miners, or lack thereof in the benchmark U.S. equity index. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is up a staggering 128.1 percent year-to-date. However, only 17 percent of GDX's holdings are U.S. companies, meaning 83 percent of the ETF's members cannot be included in the S&P 500. “Matt Miller, S&P Global Market Intelligence equity analyst, thinks one important reason for equities outperforming the bullion is the high levels of operating (and in some cases financial) leverage for gold miners. Miller also notes expanding margins and strong free cash flow, which have been a result of declining All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC), a standardized measure of cost reporting that estimates the full-cycle costs to produce and sell an ounce of gold,” said S&P Capital IQ.

2016-08-17,Is The Recent Consolidation Signaling A Top In The Metals Complex?,"First published Sat Aug 13 for members of ElliottWaveTrader.net: This past week certainly saw a lot of action in the metals, but we did not see any real movement by the time we closed the week. In fact, gold and silver ended near where they began for the week, whereas GDX did have a little upside progress on the week. And, after each consolidation we have experienced during 2016, voices are raised about us topping. Many believe we have come too far, too fast. However, each consolidation we have seen throughout the year has only led us to higher prices. So, in truth, I cannot accept the premise that the market is topping unless some amount of upper support is broken. You see, we have not had any pullbacks which have exceeded a .382 retracement of the prior move throughout all of 2016. And, such strength is not suggestive of weak market. In fact, it states loudly and clearly that this is an incredibly strong market, and one which we cannot assume is about to break down. Moreover, as I have noted, these shallow retracements have even made it a bit more difficult on us analysts: Now, normally, we see .500-.618 retracements for 2nd waves, whereas 4th waves usually retrace .236-.382 of the prior move. And, the deeper 2nd waves provide us with clear guideposts for the larger count. But, when we have had the decimation we experienced from 2011-2015 in the complex, it is not unusual to expect that even 2nd waves may only provide us with .236-.382 retracements, which I warned could be a strong possibility even before we began this rally in 2016. And, this seems to have been the nature of the market since we rolled into 2016. But it does lead to a bit more uncertainty due to having to accept higher 2nd wave retracements, which make it hard to discern between 2nd and 4th waves. So, while many are getting nervous in their long positions in this market simply because we have not been able to break out this week, may I remind you that not only have we not broken down, but we have not even had more than a .382 retracement this year. Moreover, most of the positions you are in (assuming you have been following our analysis for the last year) are well over 100% profitable this year alone. So, you have plenty of cushion to continue to follow Mr. Livermore’s wise words: “After spending many years in Wall Street and after making and losing millions of dollars I want to tell you this: It was never my thinking that made the big money for me. It was always my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight!” So, as I noted last weekend, I am suggesting you continue to sit tight as long as the GDX remains over the 29 level, GLD remains over the 123.50/124.50 support region, and silver remains over the 18.80/19 support region. And, as always, if there are any changes to what I am seeing in the charts, I will be sure to send out a mid-week metals update to alert you all to any changing circumstances. Remember, we are dealing in probabilities, not certainties. So, while my primary expectation for us to be heading higher is at an estimated 70% at this point in time, that still does mean there is a 30% potential that a deeper retracement can take hold in the coming weeks. RECENT UPDATE FROM WEEKEND: Lowering bullish support down to 28.50-29 on GDX.

2016-08-19,"Expect Growth For Industry, Sector ETFs","When exchange-traded funds burst onto the scene in the United States over two decades ago, advisors and investors viewed these instruments as cost-effective, efficient tools for gaining exposure to broad market indexes, such as the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100 and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. ETFs, Broad Market Exposure And Investors Today, broad market exposure is a still a primary driver of growth for equity-based ETFs. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) is the world's largest ETF, and eight of the 10 largest U.S. ETFs are simple index-tracking funds providing broad market exposure to U.S. or international stocks. Related Link: Shorts Are Running To Cover Some Of This ETF's Holdings However, advisors and investors are increasingly warming to the tactical advantages of having some direct sector exposure via ETFs. While still not on par with broad market funds, a fair amount of sector and industry ETFs are found among the largest U.S. ETFs. Of the 100 largest U.S. ETFs as ranked by assets, 16 are sector or industry ETFs, a group that includes familiar names such as the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLF), the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE) and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). Investor Sentiment State Street Global Advisors (SSgA), the third-largest U.S. ETF issuer and the largest sponsor of sector ETFs, recently polled nearly 420 advisors and wealth managers regarding their use of sector and industry ETFs. While the findings vary, the overall tone bodes well for the current and future growth of sector and industry funds. “Over 85 percent of survey respondents had some exposure to sector and/or industry funds, with more than a quarter of them indicating that sector/industry investing was a major part of their US equity strategy,” said SSgA. “Interestingly, uncertainty about how to execute a sector investing strategy was a key factor cited by non-users, who often indicated a willingness to try sector/industry investing if given sufficient information and guidance.” SSgA data suggest many respondents to the survey use sector or industry ETFs for tactical exposure or as satellite positions. However, some money managers use sector and industry funds to complement core equity exposure and as a way of generating low-cost alpha. Sector Outperformance In any given year, there are sectors and industries that outperform the broader market. Last year, the S&P 500 gained about 1.4 percent, but the Consumer Discretionary SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLY) climbed 10 percent.

2016-08-25,The Crowded Gold Trade Gets Thinned Out,"The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is showing some resilience on Thursday, bouncing back 1.8 percent after a disastrous four days of trading.

Wednesday’s big 7 percent drop in the GDX market the ETF’s fourth consecutive decline and its seventh daily decline in the last eight sessions. From a technical standpoint, the GDX closed significantly below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since January. Despite the rebound on Thursday, the GDX remains below its 50-day SMA. In addition, GDX dipped below $27, taking out the $27.44 support level that held in July after making a series of higher lows throughout the first half of the year.

2016-08-26,A Tale Of 2 ETFs: How GDX And GLD Compare When Gold Shines Or Dulls,"Gold prices have been on a tear in 2016, making for some happy investors. However, some gold investors are happier than others. The price of gold has jumped 27.0 percent since the beginning of the year. In that same time, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) is up 24.9 percent. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), on the other hand, has skyrocketed 102.9 percent this year. What is the difference between investing in the GLD and investing in the GDX? Gold miner stocks tend to be much more volatile than gold itself. This phenomenon makes sense because a 30 percent decrease in the price of gold, for example, would likely completely eradicate the margins of most gold miners and put their solvency at risk. However, a 30 percent increase in the price of gold would likely allow a number of gold miners to double or triple margins and income. Related Link: The Crowded Gold Trade Gets Thinned Out CXO Advisory crunched the numbers on GLD and GDX last year, comparing their relative performances from May 2006 to September 2015. Not All That Glitters... While the GLD’s weekly movements are almost perfectly correlated with the price of gold, CXO found that the GDX’s weekly price movements are only 64 percent correlated with gold. In the long term, the GDX has demonstrated a slightly negative weekly alpha relative to the GLD, meaning it tends to underperform.

2016-08-30,Time To Reassess,"The following article was originally published for members of ElliottWaveTrader.net. After coming into this past week still expecting the market to test a bit lower towards our 28.50-29 region support level, we clearly tested that region. However, the market did not pass that test. With the market breaking down below our support region in the Market Vectors Gold Minors ETF (NYSE: GDX) this past week, it has clearly caused us to reassess where we are in the big picture in the market. To that end, I want to quote sections of the update I sent out to members at Elliottwavetrader.net the day we broke down: First, while my expectation was for the $28.50 region to hold, I do apologize that my expectations were off this time. I wish I could say that I was always right, but, clearly, that is simply not possible. While we have done very well in the metals throughout the years, there are times like this when my primary expectation will be wrong, and I do apologize for those times. But, in prior analysis over the last few weeks I explained that if we broke the $28.50 support, it suggested we could drop towards the $27 region. After reviewing the charts and running a number of different calculations and scenarios at this time, there is no question that the lack of real pullbacks in the GDX has not given us the highest confidence as to where to put second waves in this rally. And, since our Fib Pinball method is based upon an appropriate identification of second waves, it has made it a bit difficult, and was likely why I was wrong in my expectation for $28.50 to hold. I have discussed this issue many times in the past. In fact, several weeks ago, when I was still expecting the market to hold support, I warned about becoming too aggressive in this market just yet purely because of the real lack of pullbacks: Now, for those who will read my words and consider leveraging up to the hilt in an irresponsible manner, I want to interject reasons one should still maintain your standard risk management practices. Set ups such as these are estimated to be about 70% probability. That still means there is a 30% probability that it could fail. One of the reasons this set up could fail is because all retracements in the GDX chart have been VERY shallow. This forces an analyst such as myself to make certain educated assumptions about where second waves in the structure are located (since they are otherwise deeper retracements), which can have an effect upon the overall wave count if even one of those assumptions is wrong. Now, normally, we see .500-.618 retracements for 2nd waves, whereas 4th waves usually retrace .236-.382 of the prior move. And, the deeper 2nd waves provide us with clear guideposts for the larger count. But, when we have had the decimation we experienced from 2011-2015 in the complex, it is not unusual to expect that even second waves may only provide us with .236-.382 retracements, which I warned could be a strong possibility even before we began this rally in 2016. And, this seems to have been the nature of the market since we rolled into 2016. But it does lead to a bit more uncertainty due to having to accept higher 2nd wave retracements, which make it hard to discern between 2nd and 4th waves. Over the last several weeks, I have also noted that I was having problems aligning where the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) was relative to the other charts. And, it may turn out that the GLD was the tell rather than the other two charts. You see, I had the GLD in a i-ii, 1-2 structure for well over a month now, and it seems that the other charts have now moved to align with the chart that I was initially questioning. In fact, the GLD is the one chart that has held the support I have been citing for over a month, whereas silver and the GDX have both dropped deeper than I expected over a month ago. As you can see from the attached charts, due to the bigger pullback in the GDX, along with the deeper pullback in silver, it would make the most sense that all these charts now align with the same count I have maintained in the GLD. While this was my alternative count in the GDX until we broke down this week, the break down has now made it my primary count. While I can certainly turn bearish like the rest of the market has seemed to do once the GDX broke down, I am really swayed by the technical picture on the silver 144 minute chart. Throughout all of 2016, every time we have had the positive divergences that we now see on that chart, it has portended a strong rally about to start in that market. Moreover, the GDX is now as oversold as it has been all year, and the bearishness is almost palpable. And, while GDX can certainly become even more oversold, I am relying on the positive divergences seen in silver to guide me yet again. Furthermore, the night of the breakdown in the GDX, the management team of our EWT Miners Portfolio met for several hours to review all the charts we follow in the complex. In fact, the four of us reviewed almost 100 charts that night. Those charts also led us to the conclusion that maintaining a larger degree bullish perspective is the appropriate course of action for now, even if we see the potential for a little more downside in the coming week. For this reason, I will be watching the $25.50-$25.75 region in the GDX, along with the $17.80 region in silver (.618 retracement of wave one of iii as now counted) as the modified support regions in those two charts. As the GLD has held its support quite well thus far, I will maintain the $123.50-124 region as my support in that chart. So, for now, I will remain cautiously optimistic. I am awaiting our next bullish signal of a (i)(ii) set up or wave 3 of iii to give us a much stronger short term bullish indication. Until such time that we have that set up in place, I will remain cautiously optimistic as long as we remain over support. And, as I noted in our Trading Room on Friday, the market provided us with an excellent opportunity to hedge our long term positions with the expected rally we had on Friday back to the break down point. I will hold my hedge as long as we remain below Friday’s high in the GDX. In the immediate perspective, as long as we remain below Friday’s high, I am still expecting a test of the lower levels cited above. A break out over Friday’s high is the first indication that a bottom to this correction may have been struck, and I will be looking for the next bullish (i)(ii) set up to provide me higher assurance of that assumption. However, if the market should break all the levels cited above, it would suggest that a much deeper and longer correction is taking hold in the market (as presented in the blue count on my GDX chart), and may even increase the probabilities that a lower low MAY be seen. But, as it stands right now, I view the estimated probabilities that we are within a new bull market in the metals complex still at 70%. See charts illustrating the wave counts on the GDX, GLD and Silver (YI) here."
2016-09-14,Correction May Continue Through September,"The following was originally published September 10 for members of ElliottWaveTrader.net The market action this past week started out quite strong, and raised many hopes. However, since I do not have a clear 5 wave structure confidently developed off the recent lows, I have to put hopes aside, and view the market in a dispassionate manner. And, that dispassionate manner sees strong potential for another drop in the complex. Last week, I noted that I can become aggressively bullish again should we see a clear 5 wave structure complete off the recent lows. While I can make a colorful attempt at classifying the recent rally in the metals complex as a 5 wave structure, I have to be honest in my analysis and state that, to me, it did not look like a clear 5 wave structure. So, the immediate bullish count will only be an alternative to me at this time, which the market will have to prove to me. That means I have moved into the current market action representing a wave ii in the larger GDX count, whereas silver and gold still seem to present as a wave 2 in wave iii. However, should the GDX be able to strongly break out impulsively over the recent highs, then I will view everything in the heart of a wave iii higher. This is my simplified perspective. Now, before we move into the individual charts, I want to note something I have suggested in the past. For those that remember back to 2015, I was suggesting we would see a paradigm change in our markets. In fact, I noted that we would likely see the metals trade in tandem with the equity markets, especially since most assumed the exact opposite would occur. And, 2016 has, thus far, proven me correct in my expectations. As you know reading my analysis of the SPX, with the strong decline seen in the SPX on Friday, it seems the SPX may have almost caught up with the wave count seen in the GDX. This would mean that both may see a “corrective” rally in the coming week or two, which would complete a b-wave structure in a larger 2nd wave count. This could set up a c-wave for both into the end of the month, and complete a larger degree correction, which would set up the next major rally phase in all the markets we are following. Again, this is not written in stone, but these markets have been following my larger expectations I provided back in 2015, and I have seen no reason to make me consider abandoning this perspective at this point in time. Now, let’s move onto the charts. In starting with the daily SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) chart it is very hard for me to come up with a very bearish pattern. The move down off the August high was clearly corrective, which suggests this is simply a high level correction in the GLD. But, that does not mean that a little lower will not be seen. While there is a certain amount of conjecture I am presenting, my “assumption” is that we see a rally back towards the highs as a b-wave rally, followed by a c-wave down to complete wave 2 of wave iii. It would take a strong move through 132 to make me consider that the heart of the 3rd wave has taken hold, and we would be targeting the 150 region next. In moving onto the silver chart and applying the same pattern, it would suggest we also re-test the August highs in a b-wave, followed by a c-wave back down towards the 18 region before this correction completes. This now brings me to the Market Vectors Gold Minors ETF (NYSE: GDX). While I would love to view the GDX in the most bullish sense, it is hard to view the last rally as a clear and clean 5 wave structure off the lows. Of course, I can view the extended move up as an extended 5th wave in wave (i), but that will only be my alternative count at this time. For now, I think the market suggests that we should see at least the 24 region, but, more likely the 22 region. Should we see a stronger extensions lower, then the 19.70 region will likely complete this wave ii and set up the next major rally in this complex. My alternative, more immediate bullish perspective gains more bite on an impulsive move through the 31.50 level on the next rally. As an aside, the main reason I am expecting another rally within what I am counting as a b-wave bounce is because it is much less likely that the last high represented all of the b-wave since it is not terribly proportional to the a-wave decline. So, from a timing, structure and “look” perspective, I think we “should” see another rally potentially beginning this coming week. In conclusion, I still believe we have estimated 70% probability that the larger bull market in the metals complex has returned. However, based upon the action seen this past week, I am not yet convinced that the low to this correction has been seen. But, as you know, I always maintain an open mind, and should the market prove this to be wrong, I have given you what I need to see to convince me to be immediately bullish and I will send out a strongly worded alert to our members at Elliottwavetrader.net should that occur. See charts illustrating the wave counts on the GDX, GLD and Silver (YI) at https://www.elliottwavetrader.net/scharts/Charts-on-GDX-GLD-Silver-YI-201609111365.html ."
2016-09-21,Why Miners Can Double Or Triple Within Nine Months,"The following was originally published on September 17 for members of ElliottWaveTrader, and has been edited slightly for brevity. Yes, you heard me right. The miners are setting up in a pattern which can see them double within the next nine months. Let me explain. With the current action we have been experiencing over the last month, it seems as though the Market Vectors Gold Minors ETF (NYSE: GDX) has completed 5 waves off its January lows, which I have classified as wave i. That means that the current pullback is likely a wave ii, with the alternative being wave 2 of iii (noted in yellow). And, since my biggest complaint about this market has been that we have not had a clearly defined 2nd wave pullback, the market may be providing me with a “gift.” You see, once we have a clearly defined i-ii structure in place, our Fibonacci Pinball method will be set up to provide rather accurate guideposts once this correction runs its course, and we break out to higher highs. Within a 2nd wave, the market will usually drop to the .382 retracement of the prior 5 wave structure in the a-wave of the 2ndwave. Thus far, what we are counting as the a-wave of this wave ii has come up a bit short of the .382 retracement, which is located at 24.38. Now, when the market comes short of a Fibonacci target, we often see the (b) wave of the following wave structure striking the appropriate target. That means that the (b) wave of the b-wave can very well strike that target before we see a (c) wave rally. Moreover, this assumes that the market will see a standard b-wave structure. Normally, the market will provide a well-defined (a)(b)(c) structure within a larger degree b-wave structure. Thus far, we have not seen that, as we have only seen one corrective rally, which is why I have still been giving the market the opportunity to develop the standard structure, which would provide us with a (c) wave rally. But keep in mind that these are simply the “standards,” which means there will be outliers at times. And since this larger corrective structure suggests that we “should” see at least the 22 region (.500 retracement) as a target for the entire wave ii, one should treat any rally in a (c) wave of a b-wave as an opportunity to hedge their portfolio, rather than attempting to trade that structure to the upside in an aggressive fashion. Ultimately, it would take a break down below the .382 retracement of 24.38 to provide more certainty that the market is heading directly down to the 22 region to complete the c-wave of wave ii sooner rather than later. So, you may consider me foolish, but I have to abide by standards, and am still looking for that rally to complete a “standard” b-wave, which needs a (c) wave rally to commence quite soon. Dr. Cari Bourette, of MarketMood.net, is also expecting higher in the upcoming week based upon her gold market sentiment analysis. In fact, she even has the potential for the entire correction to imminently complete. Now, as far as the c-wave is concerned, the most common target for the c-wave is the 1.00 extension off the top of the b-wave, where a=c. And, if the b-wave is now in place, then the a=c overlaps right at the .500 retracement in the 22 region. That is what we call “confluence.” The second most common target is where the c-wave is equal to 1.382 times the size of the a-wave, off the top of the b-wave. And, that overlaps with the .618 retracement of wave I in the 19.80 region. Yes, this is another point of “confluence.” All of this suggests that, as it stands now, the maximum I would be comfortable with is the 19.80 region for wave ii. Anything below that region increases the potential that the lows in the market have not yet been seen. This is where the larger degree projections to the upside come in. Assuming that the 19.80 region holds as support, it suggests that the minimum target for wave iii in the 1.618 projection of waves i and ii is in the 51 region. Again, this assumes that we drop no further than the 19.80 region, and also strike the standard target for a wave iii on the upside. However, since it is quite possible that we hold the 22 region, and since the metals complex often strikes extensions beyond the 1.618 for its 3rd waves, it would suggest that the wave iii of a larger degree wave (1) would likely target the 55-60 region. Furthermore, since wave i took approximately 6 months, and wave iii is often stronger than a wave i, it would suggest that wave iii can also complete within 6 months, and potentially earlier once wave ii completes. And assuming that wave ii can still take us another several weeks to another month or so, we should easily be able to double, and maybe even triple,in the GDX within the next nine months as long as we hold the 19.80 region for wave ii. This also suggests that within 12-15 months we can challenge and potentially even slightly exceed the 2011 highs in the GDX to complete the larger degree wave (1), which should kick off a multi-month wave (2) pullback. This would also provide an extraordinarily high probability signal that a multi-decade bull market in this complex is underway. As far as the underlying metals themselves, they seem to be within a slightly more accelerated bullish path, which can still take them back towards their 2011 highs within the next year. While the GDX seems to be in a i-ii structure, the count I have been following in the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) and silver is a i-ii, 1-2 structure. While the GDX is still within its machinations for its wave ii, I have the same relative count for the wave 2 of wave iii in GLD and silver. Therefore, the way it looks at the moment, the wave 2 of iii correction in the metals does not yet look complete. As with the GDX, while we may see an immediate continuation lower to complete the c-wave of wave 2, I believe the silver chart may be suggesting we see a rally before that c-wave down takes hold. As you can see from the attached 144-minute chart, every time we have had this positive divergent set up on the silver 144-minute chart MACD it has portended the commencement of a strong rally. This has been the case for each and every rally we have experienced in 2016. Will it fail this time? This I cannot answer, as I only deal in probabilities and not certainties. And each and every time we have had this set up in 2016, we have seen a rally. In conclusion, due to the “standards” we ordinarily see in the market, the silver 144-minute chart signal, and Dr. Bourette’s market sentiment analysis, I am still going to look for another rally to take hold as long as the GDX is over 24.38. Moreover, I am going to assume that rally is going to be the (c) wave within a b-wave corrective rally, setting us up for one more drop in the c-wave of wave ii. Alternatively, should the next rally see GDX and silver break out to new highs over their August highs, and the GLD break out over 132, before seeing that c-wave down, then I will assume the correction has completed, will stop out of all my hedges, and expect that we are on our way into the heart of a 3rd wave rally in the metals complex."

2016-10-04,"Gold's Selloff Accelerates, But Still One Of 2016's Best Performers","Gold and gold stocks continued their losing streak on Tuesday morning, with the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) down another 2.1 percent. Tuesday’s decline marks the seventh consecutive decline for the GLD and has the ETF set up for its lowest closing price since June. Strength in the U.S. dollar coupled with positive September manufacturing data from the Institute for Supply Management on Monday is likely driving Tuesday’s decline. In the past seven sessions, GLD has declined 4.0 percent, giving up a large chunk of its 2016 gains. Other gold stocks and ETFs have been hit even harder. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are both down more than 9 percent in the past seven sessions. Not surprisingly, the 3x levered Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JNUG) is down 28.2 percent during the seven-day stretch. Inverse gold ETF Direction Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: DUST) is up 30 percent.

2016-10-07,Gold Finally Trading Higher After 9 Down Days,"The Labor Department reported September U.S. jobs growth of 156,000 on Friday, slightly below consensus expectations of 175,000. Despite the miss, yet another month of solid job growth is further evidence for the Federal Reserve that the economy can handle another interest rate hike by the end of the year. After opening slightly higher, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) took a nosedive within the first 30 minutes of trading in response to the jobs numbers. Gold, on the other hand, is showing signs of life on Friday. Following nine consecutive down days, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) is up 0.4 percent in volatile early trading on Friday. Related Link: Flash Crash? The British Pound Collapsed 6% In One Minute Last Night In addition to the 156,000 additional jobs, the Labor Department also reported a slight uptick in the unemployment rate from 4.9 percent to 5.0 percent. However, wage growth came in at 2.6 percent on the month. While still short of 3.0 percent, it’s a relatively strong number compared to the sub-2.0 percent growth rate that lingered for years since the last recession. During its nine-session losing streak, the GLD had fallen 6.3 percent. Despite the recent pullback, the gold ETF has still significantly outperformed stocks in 2016. The GLD is up 18.4 percent this year compared to a 5.5 percent gain by the SPY. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) was up more than 1 percent, while the two gold miner ETFs -- Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JNUG) Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT) -- were up more than 6 percent."

2016-11-04,How To Trade Gold During This Election Week,"A number of new polls show the 2016 presidential election race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is tightening heading into the final days of the campaign. If there’s one thing that financial markets don't like, it's uncertainty, and the election seems to be providing more than enough. Stocks have understandably struggled as the race has tightened, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) is now down 2.9 percent in the past month alone. However, defensive safe-haven investments like gold have been on fire. Investors looking to hedge against the financial market fallout from a potential Trump victory have been pouring into gold and gold ETFs. In the past five trading sessions, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) is up 2.3 percent, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is up 6.4 percent and the Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT) is up 19.8 percent. Between now and November 8, gold and gold and gold stocks will likely continue to trade up and down in-line with Trump’s poll numbers. A Clinton victory coupled with Republicans maintaining control of Congress would likely be seen as good news for stocks and bad news for gold. A pair of new polls on Thursday by CBS News/New York Times and ABC/Washington Post show Clinton with a 2-3 point lead over Trump. New polls by the LA Times/USC and Rasmussen Reports give Trump a 3-5 point lead. The latest IBD/TIPP Tracking poll shows the race a dead tie."
2016-11-08,Metals Going Mental Before The Election,"Most metals are advancing ahead of the U.S. presidential election irrespective of their risk disposition. However, the trend in recent sessions is reminiscent of a see-saw amid conflicting signals concerning the election results. On October 28, the markets were jolted by the FBI re-opening investigations into Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal after e-mails sent from the Democratic candidate were found in the computer of one of Clinton aide Huma Abedin's estranged husband. However, Clinton's name was cleared yet again last Sunday and promptly markets headed higher on the catalyst. Gold Begins To Glitter After Monday's Loss Of Luster Safe haven gold is advancing, with the most actively traded December futures gaining $3.40 currently to $1,282.80 a troy ounce. The yellow metal typically outperforms when risk aversion rules the roost and is also inversely correlated with the dollar, given that it is denominated in the dollar. However, Tuesday's gain has come after a 1.95 percent slump on Monday, the biggest single-day percentage drop in five weeks, as prospects of a Clinton-victory brightened following the FBI clearing her in the e-mail scandal. Despite Monday's setback, gold has been on a roll in recent weeks, thanks to its safe haven appeal, and has recorded gains for the fourth straight week in the week ended November 4. All That Glitters Is Not Gold ... Silver, Platinum And Palladium Shine, Too Among the other precious metals, silver, platinum and palladium futures are all higher. December silver is up $0.194 at $18.345 an ounce after slipping 1.2 percent on Monday, which however came after a 3.2 percent gain in the week ended November 4. After a $3.10 retreat on Monday, platinum futures for January delivery are tacking on $9.40 to $1,010.80 an ounce. Palladium futures, which bucked the downtrend on Monday by rallying $31.60 to $656.40 an ounce, are gaining $4 to $660.40 an ounce. China Boost For Copper Among base metals, copper futures for December delivery are adding $0.0295 to $2.3390 a pound. Copper has been having an extended pre-election run up, having gained 2 percent on Monday to $2.3095, marking the eleventh straight session of gain. Copper is riding the China momentum, as the commodity-hungry country is showing signs of renewed vigor amid policy actions. Oil Plagued By OPEC's Resolve At the same time, oil is bleeding, with a barrel of oil currently fetching $44.48, down $0.41 from the previous session's close of $44.89 a barrel. On Monday, the black gold added $0.82 to $44.89 a barrel, as the Clinton news, OPEC's reiteration of its resolve to implement production cuts and an earthquake that hit the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub proved bullish for oil. A Look At How Metal Stocks/ETFs Fared Amid Metals' Gyrations Avino Silver and Gold Mines Ltd (NYSE: ASM) is currently up 0.86 percent at $2.34 after soaring roughly 20 percent since the re-opening of the Clinton e-mail case. Gold's rally on its safe haven status has buoyed the stock. Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: DUST) is down 2.73 percent at $38.42.

Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is gaining 0.91 percent to 24.30, adding onto the 1.13 percent gain since October 28. ProShares Ultra Silver (ETF) (NYSE: AGQ) is up 4.7 percent on the day, trading at $44.99. It is up over 66 percent year-to-date and 13 percent over the last month. SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) is up a modest 0.15 percent at 122.34. On October 28, the fund ended at 121.58."
2016-11-09,What's Going On With Gold Today?,"Gold is on a tear Wednesday, as the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States has sent traders scurrying towards safe havens. Riding on its safe haven appeal, the yellow metal has risen $7.20 to $1,281.70 an ounce. The December futures have come substantially off its highs after being up about $64 to $1,338.30 an ounce. The sharp jump was the highest since the levels reached on June 24, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote in the United Kingdom. The dollar is currently mixed, although it did come under selling pressure earlier on expectations that with Trump at the helm, an interest rate move is unlikely in the near terms. Dollar weakness is salubrious for gold, as the yellow metal is denominated in dollar. Gold stocks, both big and small-cap stocks, and gold ETFs are also moving in tandem with the commodity. ETFs Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) was up 4.47 percent to 25.04. Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT) was jumping 12.41 percent to 14.72.

Harmony Gold Mining Co. (ADR) (NYSE: HMY) was up 3.98 percent at $3.27."
2016-11-11,Gold ETFs Can Can Still Regain Their Luster,"Investors betting that gold and exchange traded funds such as the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) would rally in the wake of Republican Donald Trump's shocking victory in Tuesday's presidential election have been disappointed. Although it has been just two trading sessions since Tuesday, IAU and rival gold ETFs have struggled. This is happening despite the fact it appears unlikely the Federal Reserve will move forward with a December interest rate hike as previously expected. Gold benefits from lower interest rates because, as an asset with no yield, the yellow metal loses allure as bond yields climb. Volatile Metal Much of this year's gold volatility can be attributed to investors' knee-jerk reactions to Federal Reserve commentary on interest rates. For example, IAU and rival gold ETFs tumbled last Friday after one Fed member said the central bank should not wait too long before raising rates. Gold is more attractive when interest rates because there is no yield as there is on a bond fund, meaning capital appreciation is the only way investors in these products are compensated for taking on gold market risk. With the dollar weak and trillions of dollars (and rising) worth of negative-yielding sovereign debt throughout the developed world, a perfect storm for gold has been brewing this year. Bull Case Not Dead A Trump victory was supposed to add to gold's ebullience, but that hasn't been the case. Not yet at least, but that doesn't mean the bull case for bullion is dead. Rising inflation could be another boon for gold and inflows to Treasury Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS) and related ETFs suggest investors are concerned about inflation. “Based on the 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) market, inflation expectations recently hit 1.75%, the highest level since the summer of 2015. To the extent that rates are being driven by changing perceptions of inflation and not real rates, higher interest rates may not be an impediment for gold,” according to a recent BlackRock note. Accounting for inflation, real U.S. interest are in negative territory, further increasing the potential for out-performance by gold relative to other safe-haven assets. “Can inflation expectations continue to rise? Probably. Despite the sharp rise in inflation expectations, 10-year breakevens (the difference between the yield on a nominal fixed-rate bond and the real yield on TIPS) remain depressed relative to their long-term history. As recently as two years ago, inflation expectations were roughly 2.25%,” adds BlackRock. Disclosure: The author owns shares of IAU."
2016-11-11,"Gold Is Tumbling On Expectations Of Rising Interest Rates, Lowest Levels Since June","Gold continued its extremely volatile decline on Friday as the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) plummeted for the fifth consecutive trading session to its lowest level since June. The selling pressure was compounded by a massive dump of more than 85,000 futures contracts representing more than $10 billion on Friday morning. Gold’s week-long losing streak now has the GLD down 5.4 percent and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) down 13.2 percent. Levered gold ETFs Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT) and Direxion Shares Exhcange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JNUG) are down 36.7 percent and 42 percent, respectively, in the past week. Both ETFs have lost over 70 percent of their values in the past three months. At the same time, levered gold inverse ETFs Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: DUST) and Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JDST) are soaring in the past week, up 44.2 percent and 55.3 percent, respectively. Much of the bearishness on gold seems to be stemming from an increasing likelihood of Federal Reserve rate hikes starting as soon as December. A Reuters poll of economists conducted after the surprise election of Donald Trump found that 85 percent of economists still expect the Fed will proceed with a rate hike in December. The New York Times reports that bond market traders are anticipating that Trump will usher in an era of higher inflation and higher interest rates."

2016-11-14,Where Is Gold Headed When Interest Rates Start Rising?,"Gold selling has accelerated since Donald Trump’s surprise U.S. election win. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) is now down 4.4 percent since Election Day and 8.3 percent in the past three months. In that same time, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down 30.2 percent. Much of the gold selling is related to fears that the Federal Reserve will once again begin raising interest rates starting in December. A post-election Reuters poll found that 85 percent of economists still expect a December rate hike. However, rising interest rates may not be as bad for gold as investors are fearing. Benzinga looked back at how gold prices fared during all six of the Fed tightening cycles in the past 30 years and found that gold averaged an 11.2 percent gain throughout these cycles. In fact, gold prices delivered positive returns in four out of the last six tightening cycles. In the most recent tightening cycle from June 2004 to August 2006, gold prices soared 56.9 percent. Despite the post-election selloff, gold is actually performing very well in the current cycle as well. Since the beginning of December 2015, gold prices are up 19.4 percent. In the one week of trading following the election, levered gold ETFs have been extremely volatile. Since the election, the Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT) and Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JNUG) are down 31.2 percent and 31.6 percent, respectively.

2016-12-05,Gold Approved To Enter The $1.8 Trillion Islamic Finance Market,"Gold might be getting an extra sheen now. The Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions (AAOIFI), along with the World Gold Council, announced Monday issuance of Shari'ah Standard No. 57 on Gold and its Trading Controls, paving the way for using gold as an investment in Islamic finance. Gold will now join a group of asset classes, including equities, real estate, Islamic bonds and takaful or insurance, as investment avenues for Islamic finance. The fructification comes after 18 months of negotiations, when several Islamic scholars were consulted whether or not gold can be allowed as an investment avenue. Some of the contentions that delayed adoption included it being a ribawi item, meaning it has to be spot traded or transferred immediately. Standards The Standard, as per the release, deals with the Shariah rulings for gold, the Shari'ah parameters for gold transactions and the rulings for gold-based financial products in institutions. The new Standards greenlights investment in gold, provided all Shari'ah rulings are satisfied, including those relating to taking possession of gold and proper calculation of Zakah. Now the Islamic banks and other financial institutions can facilitate the creation of a broader range of saving, hedging and diversification products. The release said discussions of the Standard No. 57 were finalized by at the AAOIFI Shari'ah board meeting held between November 17 and 19. The standards were apparently adopted after a consultation period, including public hearing sessions, involving all key stakeholders. Aram Shishmanian, CEO of the World Gold Council, commented, This is a ground breaking initiative for Islamic investors and for the gold industry at large. We are delighted that there is now definitive Shari'ah guidance on the permissibility of investing in gold. Gold is a proven wealth preservation asset that Islamic investors can now deploy to protect their wealth and diversify market risks. A Bloomberg report quoting Mohd Daud Bakar, a Shari'ah scholar, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) will probably qualify and the standard may open new demand for central banks. The GLD is the biggest ETF backed by bullion. However, the physical backing requirement for COMEX gold futures may disqualify it. The Bloomberg report also said physical gold bars and coins may qualify. The Shari'ah rule required that a bank selling gold gas to offer same-day settlement or has to show it can provide the exact gold being sold within a day. Vast Opportunity Foreseen About 1.6 billion Muslims around the world may get greater access to the gold market, according to a report in Khaleej Times. Islamic investors thus far had access to gold market through merely jewelry and coins. Estimates for a demand increase of 500-1000 tons per annum are doing the rounds if Islamic financial institutions were permitted to set aside just 1 percent of assets into new gold products. Three offshoots seen by the Khaleej Times report include: 1) Increase in the number of diversity of available Shariat compliant gold investment products. 2) Greater emphasis on the role of physical gold in gold transactions. 3) Islamic finance will have greater say in the setting of the gold price. This could give a boost to gold prices, which are already on a tear.

2016-12-06,Time To Buy Gold: Brean's Technical Analysis,"The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) is down 8.1 percent since Election Day, but some traders are taking the opportunity to buy the dip. Break Capital analyst Frank Longman sees reason to be bullish on gold from a technical analysis perspective. “We like a little zig to the market’s zag from time to time and think that there’s a critical mass of reasons for intermediate-term investors to consider some gold exposure into weakness,” Longman explains. Longman says investors that felt “gold envy” earlier in 2016 when the precious metal was on fire shouldn’t miss out on this opportunity. In addition to gold and gold ETFs reaching technical support levels, mid-year excess in the physical market is now gone and the rally in Treasury yields may have peaked for now. Finally, he notes a recent “meaningful” positive RSI divergence in gold’s chart. According to Longman, these conditions are all bullish for gold in the medium-term. He expects gold will bounce somewhere in the $1134-$1187 range. For the GLD ETF, he proposes a price target of $123 with a stop order below $107. When it comes to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), Longman suggests a $27.40 target with a stop below $17."
2016-12-15,Pete Najarian Sees Unusual Options Activity In Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF,"On CNBC's Options Action, Pete Najarian spoke about unusually high options volume in Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). He said that the stock is trading sharply lower, but traders are buying the January 19 calls. They bought around 25,000 contracts of the January 19 calls in Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF and Najarian thinks the high volume might be a sign of a bottom in gold. He owns call options in the name."
2016-12-16,Should You Buy The Rate-Hike Dip In Gold Miners?,"Gold and gold stocks took a tumble this week following the Federal Reserve’s highly-anticipated interest rate hike. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) is down 2.1 percent this week, while the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down 6.8 percent. Triple-levered inverse gold ETF Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JDST) is up 31.8 percent. Traders looking to figure out how to time the rate-hike gold trade can look back to the trading action following last December’s rate hike. In the first three-plus weeks following the 2015 rate hike, the GLD traded up 4.2 percent, the GDX jumped 9.7 percent and the JDST fell 29.3 percent. However, the tide quickly turned for gold. From January 7–19, the GLD dropped 2.0 percent and the GDX plummeted 16.2 percent. The JDST jumped 68.7 percent in that period. After bottoming out on January 19, gold then rebounded in a big way. From January 19 to February 15, the GLD jumped 13.8 percent, the GDX spiked 51.0 percent, and the JDST plummeted 72.2. Investors And Volatility What can gold traders glean from last year’s action? First of all, if last year’s trading is any indication, there could be some major volatility in the gold market in the next two months. Of course, there was also major volatility in the S&P 500 as well during the same period last year. However, despite some bumps in the road along the way, gold ultimately demonstrated major strength in the months following last year’s rate hike. Historically, commodities have out-performed in the first six months following the beginning of a Federal Reserve tightening cycle. That history suggests traders should consider buying any rate hike dips in gold in coming days."
2016-12-18,Why It's Time To Seriously Start Considering Gold As An Investment,"As gold prices have moved sharply lower recently, it may be a good time to consider adding this asset to investment portfolios. Amid the wild optimism seen in the markets as the Dow approaches 20,000, gold remains a useful hedge against a stock market correction. Gold, Politics And Markets Gold prices have fallen more than 11 percent since Election Day and nearly 3 percent since the Fed interest rate hike last Wednesday. Gold's recent dip makes it an attractive buying opportunity, especially due to the increase in demand of the precious metals that persists in China and India. They buy on price softness typically. Westerners tend to buy on price strength. As far as gold goes, the old adage of buy low and sell high doesn't apply so much in the West, but it applies very strongly in the European and the Asian markets, said Philip Diehl, the 35th director of the U.S. Mint and president of U.S. Money Reserve. How Gold Reacts With gold's tendency to move inversely to other asset classes, the current weakness is not surprising given the market's performance, but when a reversal does happen, gold will be positioned well given the uncertainty surrounding the incoming president's administration. When gold is an appropriate percentage of a portfolio, it acts as insurance or cushion on losses in other investments, said Diehl. Gold As A Safe Haven Time and again gold has been the go-to asset in times of political and economic turmoil. While gold is an important asset to consider, many financial advisers overlook it because it doesn't have the turnover they need to produce commissions — people who buy gold, buy and hold. I think there is irrational exuberance that has swept through the markets, it can only be temporary, added Diehl. I think this can only be temporary, and investors will discover that not everybody's going to be winners. The Current Situation With the market's current rally, despite President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies remaining largely unknown. Gold is seen as a form of wealth insurance in a time of economic uncertainty. Benzinga recently reported CNBC's Pete Najarian noted that while the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDX) is trading lower, he is seeing unusually large volume of traders buying January 19 calls. It's no coincidence that Trump takes office the next day. These record highs are exactly why you need to be buying gold, not despite them. I think this is exactly the right time when people ought to be re-balancing their portfolio in recognition that they are accepting a significant degree of risk putting their money in equities right now, concluded Diehl."
2016-12-29,Gold Is Having A Big Day: How Did The Yellow Metal Perform In 2016?,"Gold stocks and ETFs are delivering some strong returns on Thursday with: the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) up 1.4 percent Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) up 6.4 percent Direxion Shares Exchange Trades Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT) up 19.6 percent Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JNUG) up 23.0 percent on the day. The Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: DUST) is down 19.3 percent. If gold’s momentum continues through the end of the week, the precious metal will end the year on a strong note, much like it started 2016. After surging roughly 20 percent by mid-February, the GLD peaked at around +28 percent by mid-summer. At that point in the year, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) was up only about 2 percent on the year, and it seemed like a foregone conclusion that 2016 would be the year of the gold trade. Unfortunately for gold bulls, the wind came out of gold’s sails in the second half of the year. The GLD has fallen 11.9 percent in the past six months and is now up only 8.8 percent. At the same time, the SPY found its mojo in the second half of the year and is now up 9.9 percent year-to-date. Even after Thursday’s early trading action, it will likely take another strong day for gold and weak day for stocks on Friday for gold to win the year."

2017-01-09,Interest Remains In Them Thar Gold Miners ETFs,"As is usually the case, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the two largest gold miners exchange traded funds by assets, had interesting years in 2016. All That Glitters After soaring out of the gates to place as two of the best-performing non-leveraged ETFs earlier in the year, GDX, GDXJ and rival gold miners ETFs stumbled later in the year as the dollar strengthened amid expectations of an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve. Gold is more attractive when interest rates are lower because there is no yield as there is on a bond fund, meaning capital appreciation is the only way investors in these products are compensated for taking on gold market risk. With the dollar weak and trillions of dollars (and rising) worth of negative-yielding sovereign debt throughout the developed world, a perfect storm for gold was brewing last year. To their credit, GDX and GDXJ have been strong over the past several weeks. Since December 15, the benchmark gold miners ETFs are up an average of 20.5 percent. Knowing that, it is not surprising that there has recently been some notable options activity in GDX and GDXJ. “We saw what looks like closing put selling in two popular Gold Miner funds this week, as portfolio managers liquidated positions in January 20 puts in GDX, GDXJ (VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners),” said Street One Financial Vice President Paul Weisbruch in a recent note. Trickling Down Increase interest in GDX and GDXJ is, not surprisingly, trickling down to the leveraged equivalents, including the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) and the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: JNUG). Up 35.6 percent and 21 percent, respectively this month, JNUG and NUGT are the best and third-best bullish leveraged ETFs in the Direxion lineup in January. For the five days ending January 6, volume in the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: JDST) was 70.5 percent above the trailing 20-day average while volume in JNUG was nearly 35 percent above its 20-day average, according to Direxion data. “The miners have recovered nicely from their mid-December lows as have spot Gold prices in general and it is possible that portfolio managers are spurning hedges in the space going into this month’s options expiration, or possibly looking to purchase higher strike puts for more protection against a move lower, since these options are now well out-of-the-money,” added Weisbruch."

2017-01-12,Gold Hits Highest Level In 3 Months,"The price of gold traded above the $1,200 per ounce mark for the first time since November, at a time when the Trump rally appears to be taking a breather. Bloomberg reported that the rally in spot gold can be attributed to President-elect Donald Trump's first press conference since his election win, which provided little substance on his economic stimulus plans. Gold for immediate delivery traded as high as $1,207.07 an ounce, according to Bloomberg generic pricing. Holdings in exchange-traded funds backed by gold rose by 1.6 metric tons on Wednesday, which also marks its largest jump since November 9. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar has fallen against its major peers and fell more than 1 percent against the Japanese yen. Moreover, the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the dollar's strength relative to its global peers, was lower by 0.8 percent. Gold is rising as question marks emerge over the consensus view that Trump would be great for the dollar and great for stocks on a grand, unfunded building plan, Adrian Ash, head of research at online gold trading site BullionVault, told Bloomberg. Traffic has been pretty much all one-way for us, customers are buying. Gold ETFs Here are how some of the most notable gold exchange-traded funds are performing ahead of Thursday's market open.

2017-01-17,Donald Trump: U.S. Dollar Is 'Too Strong',"President-elect Donald Trump's comments to the Wall Street Journal prompted a selloff in the U.S. dollar and a spike in gold-related investment tools. Trump told the WSJ that the U.S. dollar is too strong, which makes it difficult if not impossible for U.S. companies to compete against Chinese companies. The president-elect emphasized the fact that the Chinese currency is dropping like a rock. Trump has accused China as being a currency manipulator, and as president, he may officially brand the country as one. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a measure of the strength of the U.S. dollar against its major global peers, fell more than 1 percent. On the other hand, the most commonly referenced gold-related exchange-traded fund, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) gained more than 1 percent to trade at $115.50 early Tuesday morning. Trump's Comments Represent 'Noise' Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of asset allocation at HSBC Holdings brushed off Trump's comments as being chatter. He told Bloomberg that the U.S. dollar's selloff on Tuesday is merely noise rather than a structural shift. If Trump wants to become as growth-generative as he's planning to be and you don't have the same fiscal push coming from the rest of the world, then it's a question of where does the capital flow to, he added. The dollar is the tallest pygmy. Here is a summary of how other gold related exchange traded funds were performing ahead of Tuesday's market open: Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF, Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT): $10.39, up 7.11 percent. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX): $23.29, up 2.42 percent. Direxion Daily Jr Gld Mnrs Bull 3X ETF, Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JNUG): $9.12, up 8.96 percent."

2017-01-31,Gold Is The New Equity In The Trump Rally,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average recently broke above the Dow 20,000 milestone, but has since pulled back amid President Trump's controversial policies. Meanwhile, the price of gold is higher for the third straight day and is on track for its best month since June following the surprising Brexit results. By Tuesday morning, the price of gold was higher by 0.3 percent at $1,199.07 an ounce by 10:30 am in London. The gold market is in thrall to the Donald Trump show, David Govett, head of precious metals trading at Marex Spectron, told Bloomberg. If Trump sticks to his immigration policy of the last few days, then gold should remain supported. Trump Is Doing As He Says Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda, explained to Bloomberg that gold and other safe-haven commodities are likely to continue rising higher. The reason? Trump is implementing new policies that are consistent with what he said would be done during the campaign trail. Halley added that Trump's promises which are now policy are ones which will keep equities and the dollar soft but support higher commodity prices. Here are how other precious metals are performing: Spot silver is up 8 percent in January. Palladium is up 10 percent in January. Platinum is up 9.4 percent in January."
2017-02-06,Gold Futures Higher Off Goldman Sachs Comment On Trump Admin Policies,"April Gold futures are trading higher by $8.30 at $1129.10 per ounce in Monday's session. The catalyst for the rally is cautious comments from a Goldman Sachs economist regarding concerns over implementation of policies and the fact they differ from the platform President Donald Trump was elected on. After making several attempts to close over the resistance area of $1220.00, the April contract ended Friday's session at $1120.80. Following a higher open, it matched that closing price (which stands as the low for the session) and began to move higher. So far, the ensuing rally has come up shy of the quintuplet of highs from mid-November at the $1236.00 area, as $1232.20 stands as the current high for the session."
2017-02-07,Kevin O'Leary Taunts His Kids With Gold Bricks,"Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary owns gold — bulky, shiny, polished gold — not for any practical purpose, but more as a prop for parenting. I have a two-and-a-half kilo brick that I like to slam on the table on Sunday nights, and I show it to my kids saying you'll never own this, O'Leary told Benzinga. This you'll never own unless you get a job and buy your own. He said the bar is essentially useless and doesn't pay a dividend, but it merely supplements his gold portfolio. Still, O'Leary recommended potential gold investors bring home the physical bricks. A 5 percent weighting in a portfolio of gold has been useful in times of volatility, but if you look long-term at a gold chart, there have been decades where it gives you nothing, O'Leary said. If you're going to do it, use the GLD to balance the 5 percent every quarter because it's so liquid and it's low cost to you. You can put $4 million in in the morning and take it out a week later and get complete liquidity. O’Leary recently headlined the first “Benzinga Leadership Series” talk, titled “From the Basement to Billions: the Kevin O’Leary Story” at Benzinga’s office in downtown Detroit.

2017-02-24,Gold Vs. Everybody: How Strength In The Yellow Metal Is Defying Conventional Wisdom,"Much of what has happened in the U.S. stock market so far in 2017 is relatively easy to explain. Investors see President Donald Trump’s policies of deregulation and lower corporate taxes as rocket fuel for U.S. business, and the stock market has certainly reflected that optimism since Election Day. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is up 10.2 percent since the election. Gold On A Rip At the same time, Trump’s protectionist rhetoric will likely continue to keep the U.S. dollar strong relative to international currencies. “Largely, the USD will appreciate because U.S. protectionism will cause economic weakness overseas and underscore the importance of the U.S. as the safe harbor for investment,” Kennesaw State University associate professor of economics Mikhail Melnik, Ph.D. recently told Benzinga. Related Link: Why The Case For A Border Adjustment Tax Relies On A Questionable Assumption Since Election Day, the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE:UUP) is up 2.9 percent. Finally, the major market volatility that many experts predicted might happen following a Trump victory is nowhere to be found. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is down 15.1 percent in 2017, and the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short Term Futures TM ETN (NYSE:VXX) is down 27.6 percent year-to-date. The current market environment would typically be a recipe for disaster for gold investors. However, that simply hasn’t been the case so far in 2017. Bucking Historical Trends The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD) is up 9.2 percent year-to-date, and the Market vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is up 17.0 percent. Levered gold funds Credit Suisse AG – VelocityShares 3x Long Gold ETN (NASDAQ:UGLD) and Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE:JNUG) are up 28.3 and 103.0 percent this year, respectively. But Why? Why has gold been so strong in 2017 in a climate of rising stocks, rising interest rates, a rising dollar and plummeting market volatility? Traders may be looking to have their Trump cake and eat it too by taking advantage of rising stocks and a stronger dollar while still using gold as a hedge against the potential impact of negative geopolitical headlines. Historically low (and even negative) interest rates around the world have left investors with few viable flight-to-safety investment options. The gold hedge may have become so popular that the influx of capital will keep gold’s positive momentum going throughout 2017."
2017-03-09,Bank Of America Sees Gold Rising By $200 Despite Tightening Monetary Policy,"Analysts at Bank of America see the price of gold rising by $200 per ounce to hit $1,400 by the end of the year. According to a CNBC report, the analysts acknowledged tighter monetary policy isn't a bullish indicator of gold but ongoing inflation concerns, uncertainties from European elections and protectionism policies will help push the metal higher. The report also cited inventor's complacency in understanding the growing risks of U.S. and U.K. policy mistakes in the coming year. Meanwhile, investors have been utilizing a wait and see approach for gold since the presidential election last year. The commodity has lost 7 percent since Donald Trump emerged victorious in the election; the commodity is higher by around 5 percent since the start of 2017. Other Side Of The Story CNBC also cited a report by analysts at UBS who argued gold will remain under pressure ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting where the committee is expected to raise rates. This week, the focus is on employment data, the UBS analysts also wrote. Given recent Fed member comments and current market expectations, the data would need to be significantly weak in order to alter the outlook on Fed policy. Unlike Bank of America analysts who see a clear path towards gold rising throughout the year, UBS analysts are recommending commodity and gold investors stay on the sidelines for the time being.

2017-03-22,"Bullish Set Up Still In Place, But Caution Still Warranted","The following was originally published on March 18 for members of ElliottWaveTrader.net Last weekend (Mar 11), I noted that we needed to stay over 21.60 on Monday and complete 5 waves up to give us a bullish set up going into the Fed announcement. On Monday, the market gave us our 5 waves up off the prior week’s low, and on Tuesday, we saw a deep retracement of that initial upside structure, which certainly scared many people in the complex. The morning of the Fed day on Wednesday Mar 15, I sent out a “Pre-Fed Warning:” “. . . please focus on the simplicity of where we are. Micro support is 21.20, with support below that at last week's pre-market low of just below 21. As long as we hold those supports, we have a set up in place to break out.” As we know, the market broke out rather strongly after the Fed’s announcement. But, please do not make the mistake of viewing the announcement as the “cause” of the rally. Remember, sentiment was set up to take us up no matter what the Fed said. And, the fact that we went up even though most believed that a rate hike was certainly going to cause the dollar to rally and the metals to drop provided us with another example of how sentiment trumps all supposed market forces. But, just because we broke out, and confirmed our prior bottoming structure, does not mean that we are completely out of the woods just yet. It is still possible that the market may rally higher in a corrective manner, which can still suggest that a test of the 19.90 region is possible in the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) before we finally see the heart of a 3rd wave higher take hold. As you can see from the attached 8 minute GDX chart, the market struck the upper end of the target box we set on Wednesday for a 3rd wave off the recent lows, and then came back into the support box on our chart. The lower end of this support box resides in the 22.40 region, which really SHOULD hold if this is going to maintain as an impulsive structure, as presented in the green count on this chart. Should support continue to hold early in the coming week, we need to then rally towards the wave 5 of (i) noted on the chart to create an even larger 5 wave structure off the recent lows to add to the bullish evidence. However, if the GDX breaks down towards the 21.90 region before completing 5 waves up, then it strongly suggests that this rally is only corrective in nature. And, if 21.90 holds as support, then we can still rally up towards the 24.50-26 region as a c-wave, which would set up another decline back down to the 19.90-20.50 region, as presented in yellow on the GDX daily chart. This would represent a larger wave (2) pullback. So, clearly, we are not out of the woods just yet. And, for those of you that have traded with us for some time, you know that we do not view markets with blinders. Rather, we are aware of the potential on both sides of the market, and provide you with our higher probability expectations week after week. Moreover, we even tell you up front where our higher probability expectations likely invalidate, so that you can act quickly to reposition, if necessary. That being said, I have reiterated many times in the past that I will maintain a strong bullish bias when the market provides a reason to do so on the smaller time frame, specifically due to the manner in which the market rallied off the 2015 lows. And, this time is no different. That is why you see the bullish count as my primary count in green. Moreover, please see the very long term charts that Garrett Patten has been tracking (which are attached below), and you will understand why I give bullish counts the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, whenever you read my analysis, please understand that I will present the more bullish count as my primary as long as there is a reasonable interpretation to do so, specifically based upon the larger degree structure Yet, I also highlight the smaller degree potentially “bearish” set ups in order for you to know when you need to protect your account, especially when we get the first indications that the smaller degree primary bullish potential does not follow through. But, for now, the market is still presenting us a bullish potential to start the upcoming week, especially in the GDX. As far as gold and silver are concerned, again, I am going to give them the bullish benefit of the doubt as well. But, I must admit that the potential a-b-c structure on the daily chart in silver is a close second in the running. Therefore, I still think we need a bit more price action to be able to identify if this rally may morph into a corrective rally, thereby extending this wave (2) for potentially another month or so, or if we have finally begun a 3rd wave back towards the August highs.

2017-03-23,Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF Finds Resistance And Retreats,"Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) shares are trading lower by $0.36 (1.6 percent) at $22.89 in Thursday's session. For the third day in a row, it has found resistance at the $23.50 area. After peaking Tuesday at $23.50 and Wednesday at $23.56, its brief rally off Thursday's open peaked just ahead of those highs at $23.45 and turned lower. The ensuing decline has taken the ETF beyond the double close from Tuesday ($23.26) and Wednesday ($23.25), so far reaching $22.77 and is attempting to rebound. If the decline continues, there may additional support at the pair of lows from March 17 ($22.51) and March 20 ($22.58)."
2017-03-29,There Are Still Pitfalls To Watch Out For In The Metals Complex,"There is no question that the meandering of the metals complex in 2017 has tested many investor’s patience. But, a market does not scream out to the entire complex that it is about to embark upon a parabolic run. So, it will likely continue to test our patience until wave 3 of iii takes hold later this year. This past weekend, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) followed through rather well in providing us what counts best as a 5 wave structure off the March lows. And, I have noted many times that as long as 5 wave structures off lows continue to develop in this complex, I have to maintain an immediate bullish stance. That being said, silver is a little concerning to me right now. You see, if silver continues along its current path, without a pullback, directly to the 18 region, that can be considered a 3 wave structure, right into an a=c target. If it drops strongly from there and breaks below the 17.65 region (.618 extension of the current rally), it would suggest this recent action has all been corrective, and a drop to the 16.30 region would become quite likely. How that drop develops will provide clues as to whether 16.30 will hold as support. The same applies to the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD). If we continue higher to the 120.40 region, and then turn back down strongly below 118, that would also sway me into thinking this rally is corrective, and we can head back down to the 113/114 region. So, my ideal path for the complex would be to see a corrective pullback across the entire complex. I would prefer to see silver, the GLD and GDX all pullback correctively over the next week for a 2nd wave. But, if no pullback should be seen, and GDX takes out last week’s high before seeing a more defined corrective pullback, then we have to watch how silver handles the 18 region, and how GLD handles the 120.40 region. Ideally, as long as the GDX continues to drop correctively, and maintains over the 21.50-22 region in the pullback, then I can maintain my strong bullish bias. I am going to reiterate my constant perspective in this complex: As long as we continue to develop 5 wave structures off lows, then I will maintain an immediate bullish bias. But, since I don’t like to go through life wearing blinders, as doing so can often lead to quite painful results, I am going to maintain an eye towards the pitfalls outlined herein over the coming week.

2017-04-07,Time To Buy? Platinum Not Worth Its Weight In Gold,"Platinum, usually among the most precious of metals, isn’t even worth its weight in gold these days. Some analysts suggest it’s a good time to buy. “If continued negative supply dynamics persist, the platinum price forecast for the next three months may see its rightful time on the throne in 2017,” the Lombardi Letter, which tracks precious metals, said Friday. Platinum was trading at $964 an ounce on Friday, compared to $1,263 for gold, according to the Monex precious metals index. Platinum is rarer than gold and is usually valued more highly, with the exception of periodic fluctuations. An oversupply in platinum production in South Africa is considered the main reason for the metal’s position as a value play. Voices From The Street Creamer Media’s Mining Weekly on Friday asked Ben Magara, the CEO of South African producer Lonmin PLC about a statement made by Bank of America Merrill Lynch last month that the platinum price would rally if producers cut supply by 300,000 to 400,000 ounces. He said Lonmin exercised supply discipline by taking 150 000 oz of supply out of the market. “As an industry, we need to go for it. We must be bold about cutting supply. The price is telling us that we’re in oversupply and we’ve got to react,” he said. Not everybody agrees that platinum is a good buy. The journal Mining MX said the recovery is likely to be painful and slow, and noted that Goldman Sachs is still bearish on the metal's prospects. Related Links: Gold Vs.

2017-06-07,Will Barrick Finally Join The Gold Rally?,"Barrick Gold Corp (USA)(NYSE:ABX) has shown some signs of life this week after sitting out much of the gold and gold miner rally over the past several months. In the past month, the price of gold has surged 5.6 percent to above $1,290/oz. But while the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD) is up 5.3 percent and the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is up 9.2 percent in the past 90 days, Barrick shares are down 6.6 percent during that time. Barrick stock came within pennies of its 2017 high of $20.71 at around the same time gold reached a short-term peak in early April. Barrick crashed right along with gold prices and the rest of the gold mining stocks shortly thereafter. But while peers have rallied since early May, Barrick has drifted mostly sideways until this week, when it jumped 5.2 percent on Tuesday. Related Link: 3 Reasons You May See Strength In Gold This Week The market may have finally forgiven Barrick for its lackluster earnings report back in April, but the stock has some major technical resistance ahead if it wants to revisit those April highs. Barrick has traded in a range between $15.83 and $17.35 ever since its earnings sell-off, so the $17-18 range will be an important test for the stock. To make matters worse for Barrick bulls, the stock’s 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages could also add to resistance in the same area. The 50-day average currently sits at $17.60, while the 200-day average sits at $17.31. If rising gold prices eventually push Barrick above $18, the stock could run into resistance again at the $20 level where it formed a double top earlier this year after rallying from below $14 in late 2017. The stock traded at $16.99 at time of publication. Joel Elconin contributed to this report."
2017-06-12,An ETF Idea For The Fed Meeting,"Next week is a Federal Reserve week with plenty of market participants expecting the Federal Open Market Committee to boost U.S. interest rates. Gold and the related exchange traded products, including the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), often come into focus during Fed weeks. What Fed Means For Gold That scenario is predictable as gold is believed to be sensitive to changes in rates because the yellow metal does not offer interest or dividends, supposedly diminishing its allure when rates rise. Additionally, a strong dollar is seen as a hindrance to gold because commodities are denominated in dollars. GLD's roughly 11 percent year-to-date gain is due in part to the dollar being one of this year's most disappointing developed market currencies. Fed Weeks And Gold, Gold-Related Assets Still, Fed weeks can bring opportunity with gold and gold-related assets, also including the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). GDX, the largest gold miners ETF, rose modestly last week, which could be a sign of things to come with this week's FOMC meeting on tap. “In fact, has fared the best of any exchange-traded fund during Fed weeks, hands-down. GDX has ended the week positive 68 percent of the time since 2015, with a stellar average return of 2.53 percent,” according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. “The shares have surged nearly 11 percent since their early May lows, and are on pace to end atop their 10-month moving average for the first time since October.” GLD is no slouch during Fed weeks, either. The gold-backed ETF has an average Fed week return of almost 1 percent and a Fed week win rate of 68 percent, according to Schaeffer's data. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV), the physically-backed silver ETF, is also another credible precious metals play during Fed weeks. SLV “that takes the cake, as far as win rate. The silver-based fund has ended Fed weeks higher 79 percent of the time since 2015 — in a class of its own — with an average gain of 1.31 percent,” noted Schaeffer's. Investors have pulled $2.63 billion from GDX this quarter while adding almost $787 million to GLD. SLV has seen second-quarter inflows of $158.7 million.

2017-06-26,Whoops! A Fat Finger Order Sends Gold Plunging,"The price of gold fell to a multiweek low on Monday after a trader made a grave mistake. Spot gold fell around 1 percent Monday morning to trade as low as $1,236.46, which marks the lowest level the commodity has seen since May 17, Bloomberg reported. U.S. gold futures also lost nearly 1 percent to trade at $1,245.40 an ounce. The decline in gold is attributed to a large market order of 18,500 lots of gold, which represents 1.85 million ounces. This was likely a mistake, or a fat finger trade, as the order is bigger than anything seen at the peak of domestic political turmoil and the surprising outcome from the Brexit vote. The trader or institution who placed likely pressed the wrong button, David Govett, head of precious metals trading at Marex Spectron Group, told Bloomberg. Or perhaps the sell order was made as intended under the assumption that the market could absorb the large order. Either way a mistake was made, and the price of gold hasn't fully recovered, which shows that flash crashes can occur in any tradeable market — not just stocks. Last year, the British pound suffered a flash crash and plummeted 6 percent in one minute on no news. Here is a look at how gold and gold related exchange-traded funds are performing on Monday: Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE:JNUG) down 3.50 percent at $19.30. Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE:NUGT) down 2.82 percent at $32.65. SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD) down 1.19 percent at $118.24. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) down 0.84 percent at $22.55. Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE:JDST) up 3.33 percent at $62.00.

2017-07-31,Is Now The Time To Buy Gold?,"There are several ongoing stories across multiple investment classes, including stocks trading near their all-time highs, oil is trading above $50 per barrel, and the U.S. dollar continues to struggle. Meanwhile, gold is on pace for its best monthly performance since February, which may be confusing as the commodity is viewed by many as a safe-haven investment when other asset classes are struggling. Gold Is The New Gold The rise of many cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, were considered to be the new gold — that is an alternative investment that offers some form of safety from stocks, but this conception is now over, Max Wolff, a market strategist at 55 Institutional said during a recent CNBC Trading Nation segment. Investors are rising up to the reality that cryptocurrencies are prone to large sell-offs and are returning to the original safe haven tool — the yellow metal. I think risk is rising, and I think the sort of risk-free double down on risk assets period is probably over, Wolff added. Gold As An Anti-Dollar Play The U.S. dollar continues to weaken, which by default makes gold stronger, Boris Schlossberg of BK Asset Management added to the discussion. Looking forward, if there is any kind of negative data set relating to the U.S. economy or any positive data set from the Federal Reserve in terms of raising rates, then gold will deflate just as it has over the past few years. But this doesn't mean that now is the time to jump in and buy gold, he continued. There is still certainty if there will be a rally in the dollar moving forward or if the weak trend still has steam left. At the end of the day, gold is an anti-dollar trade than anything else and not so much as a risk trade. Related Links: Gold Stocks On The Move Traders Bet On Gold Miner Rally"

2017-09-06,Technical Breakdown: When To Buy Gold,"Is now a good time to buy gold if it's at the early stages of a sustainable long-term rally? The most commonly tracked exchange traded fund for gold, SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE:GLD), is up more than 16 percent since the start of 2017 but still nearly flat from a year ago. On Tuesday, the commodity saw its price trade as high as $1,345.50 an ounce after breaching the important $1,300 level on Aug. 28. The price of gold made at least two attempts to move above the $1,300 level and failed each time, Matt Maley, an equity strategist wrote in a CNBC op-ed. Rallies in April and June were each met with resistance, so a strong push above the $1,300 mark has many investors wondering how sustainable the current run is. Unfortunately, gold's 12-percent gain since early July does imply it's overbought on a near-term basis, Maley suggested. Also, gold is flirting with two key levels of $1,365, which represents the closing high from 2016 and $1,370 which is 2016's intraday high. If gold manages to meaningfully break above the $1,370 level, it could prove to be an even more bullish sign for gold and investors might want to wait for this to happen before jumping in. Otherwise, investors are cautioned to expect a bit of a give-back int he days and weeks ahead.

2018-01-16,Greenlight's Q4 Letter Reveals Another Tough Quarter For David Einhorn,"It's been a tough couple of years for value investors, and Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn has a lot of explaining to do to his investors in his Q4 letter, which was sent out Tuesday. In a year in which the S&P 500 gained 20 percent, Greenlight Capital generated just a 1.6 percent gain as the market continued to reward growth over value. Burned By Shorts In the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 gained 6.6 percent compared to a 1.6 percent loss for Greenlight. Einhorn’s long positions, led by General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) have been performing relatively well in recent months. However, Einhorn’s basket of short bets, which include Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), athenahealth Inc. (NASDAQ:ATHN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), obliterated most of Greenlight’s gains from its long positions in 2017. “We believe all those stocks appeared priced with little margin for error entering the year, and none executed well or met fundamental expectations in 2017,” the letter read. Long Winners Einhorn remains long GM and said shares are still “significantly undervalued” given stability in the auto market, the stock’s 4.4 percent dividend yield, and aggressive share buybacks, GM’s 10 percent earnings beat in 2017 and its 7x forward PE ratio. In the fourth quarter, Greenlight’s biggest winner was Mylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL). Einhorn anticipates additional generic approvals for the company in coming months following its generic Copaxone approval in Q4. Greenlight’s second biggest winner was CONSOL Energy, which completed its long-anticipated split of its coal-centered business, Consol Energy Inc (NYSE:CEIX), from its oil & gas business, CNX Resources Corp (NYSE:CNX). Einhorn said both companies have high-quality resources and strong growth opportunities and quality management teams. New Positions Greenlight also initiated a couple of new positions in Q4, most notable a “small” new position in Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR). Einhorn said Twitter’s reacceleration of user growth in late 2017 makes for a strong pitch to advertisers in 2018. Greenlight also re-purchased a stake in Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX) and took new positions in ENSCO PLC (NYSE:ESV) and Brighthouse Financial Inc (NASDAQ:BHF). Greenlight also exited long positions in the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) and Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) and closed a short position in Deere & Company (NYSE:DE). Long-Term Perspective Despite another tough quarter for Greenlight, the firm has still delivered strong overall returns for long-term investors. Since its creation in 1996, Greenlight has generated an average annual return of 15.4 percent net of fees and expenses.

2018-01-24,This Day In Market History: The California Gold Strike,"Each day, Benzinga takes a look back at a notable market-related moment that happened on this date. What Happened? On this day 170 years ago, prospector James W. Marshall struck gold in Coloma, California and the great California Gold Rush began. Where Was The Market? Neither the S&P 500 nor the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around at the time. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 1848, construction on the Washington Monument began and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War and gave the U.S. possession of much of the modern-day American Southwest. At the time of the gold rush, the price of an ounce of gold was roughly $20. The Original 49ers Long before the NFL football team, the original 49ers journeyed across the country at a time predating a transcontinental railroad in search of a fortune in gold. Gold fever started in California when prospector James Marshall claimed he simply bent down and scooped up a dozen gold nuggets from a stream at John Sutter’s sawmill. Unfortunately for all of the 49ers, news of the gold strike didn’t reach the East Coast until August of 1848, and the journey out west took at least a month’s time. As a result, the rushers earned the nickname “49ers” because many of them did not reach California until 1849. Today, investors can make bets on the next big gold strike from the comfort of their own homes by buying the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) or any of its exploration-stage gold mining stocks.

2018-02-01,This Gold Mining CEO Thinks Cryptos And Gold Are Both 'Here To Stay',"The cryptocurrency craze has been likened to a gold rush mentality, but some see a relationship beyond the comparison. “The mania in the cryptocurrencies out there has definitely taken some of the speculative fervor out of the junior gold exploration companies, where these things have incredible runs on bull and bear market cycles,” US Gold Corp (NASDAQ:USAU) CEO Edward Karr told Benzinga. But Karr’s outlook on both assets is curiously consistent: “I think both are here to stay.” The Merits Of Cryptos For a gold guy, Karr speaks fairly thoughtfully of the ostensible enemy. “Cryptos have had this incredible rise over the last couple years,” he said. “Last year was just amazing. The younger generation, the 25- to 30-year-old millennials, they’re all very comfortable with cryptos, they like trading them and they see still very big potential upside.” He does anticipate the hype will dissipate, though. It's really interesting for the short-term phenomenon, but there’s definitely a speculative amount to it,” Karr said. “Like what we went through with the dot-com bubble going into the late 1990s ... probably the cryptocurrencies will have a little bit of a wash-out.” The Defense For Gold Cryptocurrency's stature isn’t seen to diminish the appeal of gold. As Karr sees it, the tangible asset has withstood the test of time both in substance and in value. An ounce of gold in the Roman Empire bought a custom-made suit of high-quality chainmail just as an ounce of gold today, at $1,350, buys a custom-made suit of high-quality fabric. “Over 2,500 years, that one ounce of gold gets you the same custom suit,” Karr said. “You can’t really say that yet for cryptocurrencies.” At the same time, Karr said the shiny brick will endure economic cycles, wars, geopolitical crises, computer crashes and grid failures, while the incipient cryptocurrencies haven’t yet proven their staying power. His confidence in gold echoes that of Goldman Sachs, which assured that the limited, unhackable resource is and will remain a relevant asset class in spite of cryptocurrency trends and its own lack of yield.

2018-02-05,Gold Miners Celebrate A Weakening Dollar: 'Inflation Is Coming',"The U.S. dollar continued its 2017 decline through the first month of the new year, and some expect no immediate relief. The trend is welcomed by US Gold Corp (NASDAQ:USAU) CEO Edward Karr. “It should be a really good year for gold,” Karr told Benzinga in a recent interview. “I think gold’s going to go higher.” Why The Correlation? Historically, commodities have risen with inflation. As equity markets weaken, investors diversify into “safe havens” like gold, the value of which remains globally steady. “Gold has been a good long-term inflation hedge, and as the dollar declines, inflation will increase, especially through energy input costs because the price of oil becomes more expensive,” Karr said. “ ... I think inflation is coming.” What Affects The Dollar? The dollar’s value is relative to those of competitors, so strength in global currencies reduces the power of the dollar. Some economists attribute recent weakness to growth, particularly in Asian economies. The Federal Reserve can also drive a value change. Increasing interest rates incentivizes saving or bond investing, which causes deflation and increases the dollar’s value. Lowering interest rates triggers spending and economic growth, which causes inflation, reduces the dollar’s value and increases the appeal of non-yield-bearing assets like gold. A New Gold-Dollar Relationship Citigroup analysts recently argued the inverse correlation between commodities and the dollar has dissipated. “Commodity prices have traded in a strong inverse relationship with the U.S. dollar over the past decade or so, but this relationship broke down in late 2016 and the breakdown looks here to stay, the Citi analysts said. Merrill Lynch recently acknowledged the trend but said the correlation between commodities and the dollar remains. It's absolutely true that even though in the course of 2017 the correlation between oil commodities generally, and the dollar, has weakened, it is still a very very big driver,” Sabine Schels, head of fundamental commodities research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told CNBC. “And the causality really goes from the dollar to commodity prices.” Related Links: Where Experts Stand On Bitcoin After 40% Plunge This Gold Mining CEO Thinks Cryptos And Gold Are Both 'Here To Stay'"
2018-02-23,Traders Scamper Back To Gold Miners ETFs,"Amid an uptick in equity market volatility, some traders are seeking refuge in a familiar place: gold. Market participants are also renewing their enthusiasm for some gold miners exchange traded funds (ETFs), including leveraged fare. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest non-leveraged gold miners ETF, surged nearly 4 percent last week as traders flocked to the fund. “Investors piled into VanEck’s Vectors Gold Miners exchange-traded fund last week to the tune of $529 million, the most since September 2013,” reports Bloomberg. “The ETF holds shares of mining companies including Newmont Mining Corp. and Barrick Gold Corp. Gold meanwhile rallied after two weeks of declines.” Not surprisingly, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:NUGT) and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:JNUG) are getting some love, too. What The Data Say Last Friday, traders allocated $16.1 million to NUGT, good for the largest total among all Direxion leveraged bullish ETFs, according to issuer data. Conversely, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:DUST) suffered outflows of $27.2 million last Friday, the worst total among the issuer's bearish funds. NUGT attempts to deliver triple the daily returns of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, the same index GDX tracks. DUST tries to deliver triple the daily inverse returns of that benchmark. DUST and NUGT can be among the most volatile leveraged funds in the Direxion stable, reminding traders that the best use of these products as over intraday time frames. No leveraged ETF should be used for long holding periods and that is particularly true of the leveraged gold miners products, bullish or bearish. Leaning Bullish While money is flowing back to some traditional gold miners ETFs, traders are leaning bullish with leveraged fare. For example, over the past month, NUGT is averaging daily inflows of $7.11 million while its small-cap counterpart, JNUG, is averaging inflows of nearly $1.4 million, over that period, according to Direxion data. On the other hand, DUST and the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:JDST) are averaging daily outflows over the past month. Related Links: More Highs For This Retail ETF.

2018-04-11,A New ETF Of ETFs For Diverse Asset Allocation,"A new exchange traded fund aimed at providing diverse asset allocation while limiting volatility debuted Tuesday. The VanEck Vectors Real Asset Allocation ETF (NYSE:RAXX) provides exposure to real assets using the ETF-of-ETFs model. RAXX “seeks to maximize real returns while seeking to reduce downside risk during sustained market declines by allocating primarily to exchange-traded products that provide exposure to real assets, which include commodities, real estate, natural resources and infrastructure,” according to VanEck. The new ETF debuted holding 10 other ETFs, six of which are VanEck funds. RAXX can hold up to 12 ETFs and can go to 100-percent cash in the event of elevated market stress. The RAXX Report RAXX allocates over half its weight to just two ETFs: the PowerShares Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 Portfolio (NASDAQ:PDBC) and the VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE:MOO). The actively managed PDBC features exposure to a broad basket of commodities, including West Texas Intermediate crude, Brent crude, wheat, natural gas, zinc, aluminum, corn, soybeans, gasoline and gold. Speaking of gold, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), the two largest gold ETFs, combine for about 20 percent of RAXX's roster. RAXX holdings “provide exposure to agribusiness, coal, infrastructure, real estate, steel, oil services, unconventional oil and gas and gold mining companies, as well as diversified commodity futures exposure and physical gold,” according to VanEck.

2018-10-11,Gold ETF Fee Battle Intensifies,"While gold and the related exchange traded funds are struggling this year, some investors remain fond of the yellow metal and some ETF issuers are rewarding that faith with lower expenses. Upstart ETF issuer GraniteShares announced a new, reduced annual expense ratio for the GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR). What To Know BAR debuted in August with an annual fee of 0.20 percent, or $20 on a $10,000 investment. At the time, BAR was the least expensive gold ETF on the market. While the environment for gold has been challenging since BAR came to market, some investors are displaying enthusiasm for the low-cost gold ETF. BAR has about $280 million in assets under management, easily making it one of the most successful commodities ETFs to come to market last year. Why It's Important BAR's low fee inspired fee cuts and the debut of competing, low-cost gold funds, but GraniteShares is taking its low-cost leadership. The company announced it's paring BAR's annual fee to 0.1749 percent, or $17.50 per year on a $10,000 investment. That renews BAR's status as the least expensive gold fund currently available to U.S. investors. BAR's fee cut was announced as some analysts are forecasting a rebound for the yellow metal and precious metals miners. Although there is little evidence that inflation is accelerating (as of now) or that the end of this bull market is imminent, we argue that gold miners should be given a larger weight in investors’ portfolio for the following reasons: i) the economic cycle continues to mature; ii) asset valuation multiples are expanding and asset bubbles are emerging in certain areas; iii) budget deficits are increasing at alarming rates; and iv) quarterly earnings will face tougher comps in 2019, bringing into question how much longer this record-breaking bull market can continue,” said CFRA Research equity analyst Matthew Miller in a recent note. What's Next BAR and rival gold ETFs could benefit from short covering as bearish traders have recently load up on short gold positions. “For the week ending September 25, money managers increased their speculative gross long positions in Comex gold futures by 609 contracts to 98,513, while short positions increased by 1,823 contracts to 182,190. This means that gold’s net short position is 83,677 contracts,” according to Miller. “The gold market could be poised for a short-covering rally, as investors are likely to start closing out their record level of short positions, given gold’s resilience to not break below key levels of support.” Related Links: A New IPO ETF Bell Tolls For These Leveraged ETFs"
2018-11-29,Powell Pushes Gold ETFs Higher... Sort Of,"The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and rival gold-backed exchange traded funds traded modestly higher Wednesday after Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said interest rates are close to “neutral.” Three interest rate hikes this year and the subsequently stronger dollar are among the most widely cited reasons for explaining gold's struggles this year. What Happened GLD, the largest gold ETF by assets, entered Wednesday with a year-to-date loss of 7 percent before gaining 0.37 percent on above-average volume. “Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy--that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth,” Powell said in a speech at The Economic Club of New York. Why It's Important Higher interest rates are seen as a drag on gold because the yellow metal and the related ETFs don't pay a coupon or interest, leaving little incentive for income-starved investors to embrace bullion in rising rate environments. Still, GLD has been a solid performer for the bulk of the Fed's current tightening cycle. Over the past three years, a period in which the Fed has hiked rates eight times, GLD is up about 12.4 percent while the dollar is flat. Even with Powell's somewhat bullish comments, markets are pricing in an almost 83 percent of another interest rate increase next month, according to CME Group data. Some investors are bullish on gold for 2019. According to Legg Mason's Global Investment Survey 2018, “23 percent of investors said that they see gold as one of the best investment opportunities next year, unchanged from 2017,” reports Kitco News. What's Next A sustained rally for gold could lift downtrodden gold miners stocks and ETFs, assets that are dirt cheap on valuation but vulnerable to gold lagging other investments. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, gained 2.49 percent yesterday, adding to a modest fourth-quarter gain.

2019-02-21,Spike In Miners ETF Volume Matched By Leveraged Peers,"The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest gold miners exchange traded fund listed in the U.S. saw major volume spike Wednesday following a huge uptick in turnover on Tuesday. Some of the leveraged gold miners ETFs also saw big jumps in turnover. What Happened On Wednesday, 62 million shares changed hands in GDX, well above the ETF's average daily volume of 49 million. GDX “saw trading volume spike to its highest in two months Tuesday,” reports Bloomberg. “About 90 million shares worth over $2 billion exchanged hands, double the fund’s usual volume and more than any other U.S. ETF that day. GDX is the largest materials ETF and tracks corporations that are primarily involved in mining gold and silver.” Why It's Important GDX is up 9.72 percent this year and those good vibes are being felt by the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:NUGT). NUGT, one of the most heavily traded leveraged ETFs, attempts to deliver triple the daily returns of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDMNTR), the same index GDX follows. On Wednesday, 16.21 million shares changed hands in NUGT compared with average daily volume of 9.57 million shares. As Bloomberg notes, some precious metals ETFs have been shedding assets this month and some of the increased volume in GDX could be a case of selling. GDX has seen year-to-date outflows of just over $551 million. What's Next While investors have been trimming exposure to GDX, data confirm some traders are piling into the leveraged NUGT. For the five days ended Tuesday, Feb. 19th, NUGT saw inflows of $40.30 million, by far the largest inflows of any leveraged Direxion ETF during that period, according to issuer data. On Tuesday, Feb, 19th, NUGT added $9.84 million in new assets, a total surpassed by just two other Direxion ETFs on that day. Related Links A Better EM ETF A Unique Junk Bond ETF"
2019-02-24,Merger Mania Could Be Golden For Miner ETFs,"The gold mining industry could be altered by more consolidation — a development that could alter the landscape for relevant gold miners exchange traded funds. News broke Friday that Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) is considering merging with rival Nemont Mining Corp. (NYSE:NEM), a move that would create the world's largest gold miner. What Happened As of Friday, Feb. 22, Barrick and Newmont combined for 19.46 percent of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest gold miners ETF. Barrick, the world's second-largest gold miner, recently acquired Randgold Resources. The company is considering a $19-billion deal for Newmont, according to some media reports. “A deal between the two world's largest bullion miners would create a mega-gold corporation, with assets in almost every continent, including Australia, Africa, the U.S. and Latin America,” reports Mining.com. Why It's Important Newmont is working on a deal to acquire Goldcorp Inc. (NYSE:GG), GDX's seventh-largest holding at a weight of 4.76 percent. If that deal is scuttled, Barrick would have to pay a $650-million breakup fee, according to Mining.com. Newmont's $10 billion for Goldcorp, which was announced last month, would create the world's largest gold miner in terms of market value and production. Pan American Silver Corp. (NASDAQ:PAAS), a smaller GDX holding, is acquiring Tahoe Resources Inc. (NYSE:TAHO) for nearly $1.1 billion. Barrick's move to acquire Randgold Resources, which was announced in September, is seen as the deal that kickstarted much-needed industry consolidation. If Barrick and Newmont come together, Goldcorp could be left without a partner, and smaller players in GDX's lineup — such as Anglogold Ashanti Ltd. (NYSE:AU) and Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC) — could become takeover targets as well. What's Next Gold miners have worked to improve balance sheets, reducing debt following some ill-timed acquisitions at the height of the commodities cycle. Improving balance sheets, coupled with the need to bolster reserves because most of the world's easy-to-access bullion has already been mined, could spur increased industry consolidation. GDX and other gold miner ETFs have made habits of lagging broader equity benchmarks during the recent bull market in domestic stocks. From 2013 through 2018, 2016 was the only year in which GDX beat the S&P 500. Related Links: A Kraft Killer For This ETF Sneaker Plays With These ETFs"

2019-08-29,Gold's Rally Has Miners ETFs Strutting Their Bull Market Stuff,"Gold's recent rally is providing predictable benefits to some other popular exchange traded funds, those being miners products, including the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). What Happened Bullion is being bolstered by global central banks on multiple fronts. Not only are central banks, in both developed and emerging markets, seemingly racing to lower interest rates, many of those banks are also gobbling up gold. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest ETF backed by physical holdings of gold, is indeed in a bull market and that status is important. “Bull markets can be classified as either secular (long term) or cyclical (bull phases within an overall bear market),” said VanEck in a recent note. “Before its $1,400 per ounce breakout in June, gold appeared to be tracking, on a technical basis, similar to its 36-month cyclical bull market from 1993 to 1996. However, its current $1,500 price level hints at a potentially longer, sustained rally—perhaps more similar to the secular gold bull market of 2001 to 2008.” Why It's Important Not all gold rallies are met with corresponding upside by ETFs like GDX, but this time is proving different because miners have worked through balance sheet issues that plagued the group several years ago and have diligently reined in costs. Those catalysts along with some valuations that still reside on the more attractive side of the ledger powering GDX and rival ETFs higher. Over the past 90 days, GLD is higher by 19.3%, but GDX is outperforming the bullion-backed fund by a margin of roughly 2.5-to-1 over that span, indicating that if this gold bull market is potentially long-lasting, GDX's year-to-date gain of 44.7% could be the start, rather than the end of something. “Gold stocks, on average, have historically outperformed gold during gold bull market cycles in the past—including through both cyclical and secular periods,” according to VanEck. “This typically occurs because of their optionality to gold through earnings and resource leverage.” What's Next As for what's next for the miners, the aforementioned moves to shore up balance sheets by paring leverage could bode well for the group's fortunes should gold remain in bull market. “For senior or mid-tier miners, these efforts could translate to nearly 60% increases in free cash flow, on average, for a gold price move from $1,400 to $1,600,” said VanEck. “We believe that this makes a compelling case for gold stocks at the moment and, in particular, given their attractive valuation on both an absolute and relative basis.” Related Links: A Virtuous Bond ETF Inside High Dividend ETFs"

2019-11-19,13 Stocks With The Highest Average Daily Trading Volume,"One of the most basic but useful metrics a stock trader can watch is daily trading volume. Volume is simply the total number of shares that change hands in a given time period. Essentially, volume is an indication of how much attention the market is paying to a stock. A high volume means lots of trades and/or very large trades. Technical stock traders often use volume to confirm breakouts or other signals. A technical signal is often considered much more meaningful if it's accompanied by heavy trading volume. Why Average Daily Trading Volume Is Important In addition to average daily volume, traders will often watch for large changes in volume. Volume tends to spike during periods of capitulation, which can mark the end of a long-term trend. In addition, steadily rising daily volume over an extended period of time could be a sign a stock is forming a base in anticipation of a catalyst or big move. At the same time, if volume tapers off as a stock price rises, it could be a signal the stock is running out of buyers and could soon be reaching a peak or pullback. Other more advanced technical trading metrics, including on-balance volume, Chaikin money flow and Klinger oscillator, are all based on changes in trading volume. Here are the 13 stocks and funds listed on major U.S. exchanges with the highest average daily trading volume, according to Finviz: Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK), 71.1 million shares. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), 63.2 million shares. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), 62.2 million shares. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), 58.5 million shares. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Indx (NYSE:EEM), 57.1 million shares. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), 53.2 million shares. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), 51.9 million shares. Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF), 49.6 million shares. CR SUISSE AG NA/VELOCITY SHS DAILY (NASDAQ:TVIX), 38.2 million shares. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), 34.7 million shares. BARCLAYS IPTH SRS B S&P SHRT TRM ETN (BATS:VXX), 34.2 million shares. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO), 33.4 million shares. AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), 30.4 million shares. Benzinga’s Take The 13 stocks and funds mentioned above are some of the most popular and highly liquid stocks in the market. However, the volume of stocks like Nio and Chesapeake Energy may give an overly inflated impression of the market’s interest given volume is measured in shares and stocks like Nio and Chesapeake have share prices of under $2. For example, a 100-share Chesapeake trade would be worth $64, whereas 100 shares of volume in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) would be worth $175,253. Do you agree with this take?

Spot gold spiked to a high of $1,613.30/oz Tuesday evening but sold off sharply Wednesday. In Wednesday's pre-market session, gold last traded at $1,574.20/oz. Boeing (BA) - Shares were down 1% following news Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crashed near Tehran.

2020-01-08,Gold's Santa Claus Rally Followed By Surge On Iranian Tension,"Gold prices have continued to surge this week as tensions between the U.S. and Iran drive investors toward safe harbors. Gold prices increased $50 in the opening trading days of 2020 and then reached their highest levels since 2013 in the wake of Iranian missile attacks on military bases in Iraq. The commodity was trading at $1,554.62 per ounce at the time of publication. Bethel Loh, a macro strategist at ThinkMarkets, said in a note that it's a classic demonstration of risk-off, as markets took to gold with no hesitation, pushing the shiny metal well past third-quarter 2019 highs of $1,557. Benchmark crude oil prices also rose following the U.S. airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Iranian Quds force. “The gain of 1.52% sees the risk-off hedge ink new highs not seen since 2013. Fears that Iran will disrupt major oil infrastructure, not dissimilar to when drones attacked Saudi Arabia, also saw Crude futures gap at the open and sustain above key psychological level of US$70/bbl,” Loh said. A Santa Rally In Gold Gold initially traded higher throughout the Christmas holiday in a move known as a Santa Rally due to increased demand combined with thin liquidity in FX at the year's end, said Olivier Konzeoue, an FX sales trader at Saxo Markets. “The escalation of tensions in the Middle East has since sent gold to a seven year high, as markets seek refuge in a traditional safe haven in times of uncertainty. We expect gold to redeem some of its recent gains at the first signs of de-escalation.” The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was trading down 1.08% and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was trading down 4.37% at the time of publication.

2020-01-09,Gold Miners ETF Becomes A Dividend Idea,"With a yield of just 0.39%, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) doesn't scream dividend fund, but the largest gold miners exchange traded fund is making some progress on that front. GDX's dividend yield is poised to rise and not because the fund's price is falling. Rather, some of its largest components have recently unveiled significant dividend increases. Gold miners may increase cash returned to shareholders as gold prices rise but should exhibit more caution than in past bull cycles, Fitch Ratings said in a recent note. Greater discipline around capital allocation and an emphasis on sustainability of dividends when trends are bearish is anticipated, given an emphasis on maintaining financial and operating flexibility. Moreover, a focus on improving cost positions and optimizing assets due to declining availability of high-quality assets and growing interest in long-term cash generation should curb widespread shifts in financial strategy. Why It's Important Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM), the largest component in GDX at 11.73% of the fund's weight, started 2020 on the right now, announcing a major dividend hike on Monday. “Newmont announced a 79% quarterly dividend increase to 25 cents/share on January 6, stating the action aligns with its disciplined approach to capital allocation that entails maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet, investing in profitable growth and returning cash to shareholders,” notes Fitch. “Newmont recently initiated a stock repurchase program of up to $1 billion but is targeting net debt/EBITDA of below 1.0x over time, post its 2019 purchase of Goldcorp.” Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY), which accounts for almost 2% of GDX, also recently boosted its payout. Yamana recently increased its dividend to five cents/share annually, following a doubling of its dividend to four cents/share annually in July 2019, as part of a gradual and progressive approach to dividend increases, according to Fitch. What's Next Last year brought a flood of new assets to gold ETFs as prices climbed and the stage could be set for more of the same this year as interest rates remain and geopolitical tensions run high. Higher demand due to gold's countercyclical characteristics and safe haven status along with a modest supply outlook is positive for gold prices, further improving industry cash flow, according to Fitch. CRU expects the price of gold to average $1,558/oz in 2020, after averaging $1,390/oz in 2019, with total supply of 3,611 tonnes and total fabrication demand of 2,719 tonnes, resulting in a fundamental balance of approximately 892 tonnes.

2020-02-14,7 Ways To Invest In Gold Amid Coronavirus Fears,"The COVID-19 virus outbreak has certainly made investors uneasy, and the idea of a deadly global pandemic is cause for concern. One traditional safety trade for investors is to buy gold or gold mining stocks. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 3.8% so far in 2020, but the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is down 2.7%. If the new coronavirus spreading in China ultimately triggers a global economic downturn, gold prices may spike, sending gold miner margins and profits soaring. Some gold miners are better investments than others. Here are seven gold miner stocks to buy, sell and hold, according to Bank of America. Buy: Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) Analyst Michael Jalonen recently said Newmont is making good on its capital return pledge after the company raised its dividend by 79% starting in April. Newmont also plans to boost its share buybacks by up to $1 billion. The company is also refreshing its brand, changing its name from Newmont Goldcorp to Newmont Corporation. Jalonen said Newmont’s impressive project pipeline, robust free cash flow and solid balance sheet make it his top North American senior gold producer stock pick for 2020. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $52 price target for NEM stock. Buy: Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) Freeport-McMoRan is the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer and the eighth-largest gold producer. Analyst Timna Tanners recently said Freeport’s 2020 cost guidance was disappointingly high, but risks associated with the company’s shift from open pit mining to block cave mining now appear to have subsided. Tanners expects profits will normalize by 2021 once all the costs associated with the transition have passed. Ultimately, she said the transition will lead to higher production, lower costs and more byproduct credits from gold. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $14 price target for FCX stock. Buy: Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM) Agnico Eagle is a mid-tier Canadian gold mining company that operates multiple mines in Canada, Finland and Mexico. Jalonen recently said Agnico has entered a period of cash harvesting following several years of aggressive investment. Management said that cash will be used for internal investment, paying off debt and raising the stock’s dividend. Now that construction at Amaruq and Meliadine is complete, Jalonen said Agnico is well-positioned for significant free cash flow growth. Agnico is guiding for 2020 gold production growth of 10%. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $74 price target for AEM stock. Sell: AngloGold Ashanti Limited (NYSE:AU) AngloGold has 14 gold mining operations in 10 countries. Analyst Patrick Mann recently said AngloGold management is making all the right moves in focusing on returns, but the stock is overvalued following its 44.6% gain in the past year. An unpredictable global regulatory environment creates cash flow uncertainty, particularly regarding AngloGold’s operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania, the analyst said. A sale of the company’s South African operation at fair value would be a bullish catalyst for the stock, he said. Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $18.40 price target for AU stock. Hold: Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) Kinross is one of the world’s largest gold producers, with operations in the U.S., Brazil, Russia and West Africa. Kinross is guiding for 2.4 million gold equivalent ounces of production in 2020. Net debt dropped from $1.47 billion in the third quarter to $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter. Kinross generated about $100 million in cash from asset sales last quarter and Jalonen is projecting $427 million in free cash flow in 2020. Bank of America has a Hold rating and $5.85 price target for KGC stock. Buy: Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) Barrick just reported an impressive fourth-quarter earnings beat and raised its dividend by 40%. Jalonen said Barrick’s gold production outlook for 2020 is in-line with his expectations and at the high end of the company’s previous guidance, and its copper division is on solid ground as well. Barrick ended 2019 with 71 million ounces of gold reserves, up 14.5% from a year ago. The company used its $429 million in free cash flow to fund its dividend hike and pay down debt in the fourth quarter, the analyst said. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $22 price target for GOLD stock. Buy: B2Gold Corp. (NYSE:BTG) B2Gold is a global gold producer with operations focused in the Philippines, Namibia and Mali. It also has 50% ownership of the Colombian Gramalote gold project. In January, analyst Lawson Winder added the Gramalote project to his valuation, and estimated its value at about $250 million, or 24 cents per B2Gold share. Gramalote should begin production in late 2023 and boost 2024 production by about 25%, the analyst said. B2Gold has a strong cash position to fund growth and return capital to shareholders, he said. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $4.75 price target for BTG stock. Related Links: 7 Cannabis Stocks To Buy, Sell And Hold 7 Stocks To Buy Under $5"
2020-03-19,Gold ETFs Betray Safe-Haven Reputation In March Market Meltdown,"At a time when investors are desperate for safe-haven assets, gold and the related exchange traded funds aren't providing the expected shelter from the storm. This month, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), which had been on a torrid pace entering March, is lower by 5.7%. Gold miners ETFs have been much, much worse. On Wednesday alone, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) plunged nearly 23%, bringing its month-to-date loss to 32.67%. That after gold notched its biggest one-day rally since 2016 on Tuesday. From a technical standpoint, it appears bears control the gold future market right now. “Technically, April gold futures bears have the firm overall near-term technical advantage,” reports Kitco News. “Gold bulls' next upside near-term price breakout objective is to produce a close above solid technical resistance at $1,600.00. Bears' next near-term downside price breakout objective is pushing prices below solid technical support at this week’s low of $1,450.90.” See Also: Trump Signs Coronavirus Relief Bill, ECB Injects $821B In Liquidity, Japan Considers Cash Payouts Bearish Betrayal...Or Not Proving that leveraged ETFs, particularly those involving gold miners, must be treated as short-term instruments, all four of the bellwether geared funds focusing on this segment are in red this month. Yes, even in the inverse products. Take the case of Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:DUST). DUST attempts to deliver triple the daily inverse returns of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. Even amid a rough stretch for gold and the miners, DUST was scuffling this month. Until Wednesday when DUST surged 31.79% on more than double the average daily volume. A similar situation is scene with DUST's small-cap counterpart – the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:JDST) – is lower by more than 60% over the past week and that's with the benefit of a Wednesday gain of almost 22%. The Bull Case Timing reentry into the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:NUGT), the bullish equivalent of the aforementioned DUST, is historically tricky and that task is even more so following NUGT's Wednesday slide of 49.34%, but some market observers believe there are still tailwinds for the miners. “The fiscal and monetary measures currently being taken rival those seen during the housing crisis of 2008/2009, a time when owning gold and miners was extremely lucrative,”according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. “Higher government spending and stimulus generally equates to higher prices in metals, and conversely a lower U.S. Dollar. Should this trend continue, further quantitative easing and government stimulus should push prices in these sectors even higher.” Assuming those good vibes for miners materialize, ambitious traders could look to the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:JNUG), which is coming off a Wednesday loss of almost 61%, which pushed its March decline to over 90%."
2020-03-19,"Gold Analyst Says Prices Will Stabilize At $1,600 Once Market Panic Subsides","Gold’s safe haven status has been challenged further this week as gold prices continue to decline. The commodity was down to $1,498 on Thursday as world stock markets continued to slump due to the coronavirus pandemic. More risk-averse investors have been displaying a marked preference for the dollar at the expense of bullion, according to FXTM analysts. “Gold has been left in the dollar’s wake, as investors rush to lap up the greenback amid a liquidity crunch and fears that the global economy is hurtling towards a recession, said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM. With volatility in gold prices at its highest since 2008, bullion has not been spared by the market panic. Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter. Once the liquidity squeeze eases and gold prices find more stable footing, investors concerned about the global economic outlook should eventually come back to the precious metal and send prices towards $1,600, according to FXTM. For the immediate term, should bullion prices weaken further, stronger support is set to arrive at the $1,400 psychological level, Tan said. Once gold is allowed to rediscover its equilibrium, that should serve as a platform for bullion to make its way toward $1,600, the analyst said. Price Action The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was trading down 0.53% at $139.95 at the time of publication Thursday and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was trading up 7.27% at $21.11.

2020-03-31,3 ETFs Trading At Steep Price-To-Sales Discounts To Post-Crisis Averages,"With markets still grappling with the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, it seems like the global financial crisis was ages ago. Then again, the latest crisis bears reminders of the prior one, including depressed energy prices, stress in the corporate bond market and duress in the mortgage-backed securities arena. One might think that given the length of the just completed bull market coupled with the fact that this bear market arrived in rapid fashion that no exchange traded funds are trading at valuation discounts today compared to where they were in March 2009. In reality, as the ETF Research Center (ETFRC) points out, there are several well-known ETFs trading at steep price-to-sales discounts today relative to levels seen on March 31, 2009. Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter. Here are a few examples of that phenomenon. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) The energy is loaded with stocks and ETFs trading at depressed multiples and the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE:XOP) is one of the prime examples of that trend. “But demand for oil will eventually recover and with it so will the fortunes of the survivors in the E&P business,” said ETFRC. “At just 0.23x forecast sales--though again that multiple could rise as forecasts are cut further--investors seem overly pessimistic in our view, compared to how they valued these same companies back in March 2009, at 0.86x sales, not to mention an average P/S multiple of 1.2x since mid-2006!” XOP's price-to-sales discount today compared to March 31, 2009 is a staggering 73%. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest fund in this particular category, may be one of the more attractive options among the deeply discounted funds identified by ETFRC. Gold miners are in better financial shape today than they were five or six years ago, many GDX components are prioritizing cost synergies and are firming up balance sheets. Although this is historically volatile segment of the ETF market, it's hard to ignore that there's a case for gold with central banks debasing currencies – a case that is likely to grow if inflation arrives. GDX's price-to-sales discounted is a whopping 66% to March 31, 2009 levels. Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) A long-running battle cry of emerging markets bulls is that these stocks are cheap. Discerning whether this asset class is full of value or value traps is a different matter. There are valid reasons why emerging markets equities are saddled with depressed multiples relative to broader U.S. equity benchmarks, not the least of which is slack performance. For the six years ending 2019, the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:VWO) outperformed the S&P 500 on just twice on an annual basis. In three of those six years, VWO generated negative returns so perhaps it's not surprising that the largest emerging markets ETF trades at a 42% discount to its March 31, 2009 price-to-sales ratio, according to ETFRC. Disclosure: The author owns shares of VWO."
2020-04-02,Guy Adami Sees Gold Moving Higher,"Guy Adami spoke on CNBC's Fast Money about price action in gold on Thursday. The precious metal moved higher and Adami explained traders believe that gold should do well as the Federal Reserve balance sheet is expanding. He thinks gold wins in this environment and it's just starting. Adami is optimistic as Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) bounced off $41-$42 level, while VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and VANECK VECTORS/JR GOLD MINERS ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) moved sharply higher. He feels gold and mining stocks are going to continue its move higher. If you are interested in gold, you can also check SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) as a way to get an exposure to gold."
2020-04-22,"Gold Analyst Says Rally Is Short-Term, Prices Will Recede To $1,600 By Year's End","Gold has rallied over the past month, but it's a short-term rally, according to one analyst. If the global economy finds its feet over the second half of 2020, safe haven purchases of gold are likely to ease substantially, with the commodity's price falling back to $1,600 by the end of 2020. On Wednesday, the shares of several gold and silver companies were trading higher as equities gained amid a potential stabilization in oil prices. Capital Economics analyst Oliver Allen said that while gold has rallied over the past month, he doesn’t think that it will continue to outperform most other asset classes. The GSCI Precious Metals Index, in which the weight of gold is 90%, will be the worst-performing headline index among those tracked by the Capital Economics asset allocation service, he said. The index has returned almost 15% over the past month, Allen said. Of the headline indices that we cover on our Asset Allocation Service, only a handful have fared better over the same period. This has mainly reflected a surge in the price of gold, from just under $1,500/oz. to roughly $1,700. What Triggered The Recent Gold Rally? Gold’s rally has resulted primarily from two developments, the analyst said. The first is an unwinding of the fire sales that took a toll on safe, as well as risky, assets during the first half of March, as the turmoil in markets that followed the spread of the coronavirus around the world reached its peaked. The subsequent fall back in the bid-ask spread for gold suggests that this pressure has now eased considerably. The second trigger is massive policy support from the Fed, which pushed down nominal Treasury yields and led to a recovery in investors’ expectations for inflation, Allen said. “As a result, the real yields of those bonds fell by even more than nominal yields and so reduced the opportunity cost of owning gold, which is a 'real' asset that pays no income. Real yields tend to have a close relationship with the price of gold.” Allen predicts that the price of gold will fall back to $1,600 by the end of 2020. Price Action Gold prices were at $1,711.28 at the time of publication Wednesday. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was trading up 1.61 % at $161.16 at the time of publication Wednesday and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was trading up 4.91% at $32.06.

2020-04-30,"Mining Sector Hit By Coronavirus Lockdowns, Silver Production Walloped","The mining sector is seeing severe disruption, with activity being suspended across a number of countries due to the coronavirus pandemic and silver production affected. Thirty-two countries have issued partial or complete lockdown orders, leading to the temporary suspension of activities at over 1,600 mines as of April 3, according to GlobalData. Some exempted mines are also operating with reduced numbers of workers to minimize the potential spread of the virus, which is causing a slow return for the industry. Mining Regions Impacted Lockdowns remain in force in countries such as Peru until May 10, Mexico until May 30, Bolivia until April 30 and Namibia until May 4. In Quebec, the government has extended restrictions to May, but allowed mines to reopen from April 15 onward as essential services if they comply with strict measures to limit the spread of the virus. Restrictions on mining in India, Argentina, Zimbabwe and South Africa have also been withdrawn, with mining seen as an essential service. Silver Production Curtailed By Pandemic Vinneth Bajaj, mining analyst at GlobalData, explained why silver production is being severely damaged by lockdown measures. “As of 27 April, the equivalent of 65.8% of annual global silver production was on hold. Silver mining companies such as First Majestic Silver Corp. (NYSE:AG), Hochschild, Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) and Endeavour Silver Corp (NYSE:EXK) have all withdrawn their production guidance for 2020 in the wake of the outbreak,” he said. Progress has also been halted on 23 mines under construction, including the $5.3-billion Quellaveco copper mine in Peru, which is one of the world’s biggest copper mines under development, according to GlobalData. “The project has an annual copper production capacity of up to 180kt and is expected to commence operations by 2022. In Chile, while a lockdown is not in force, Antofagasta has halted work on its Los Pelambres project and Teck Resources has suspended work on the Quebrada Blanca Phase II mine,” said Bajaj. Supply Disruption Will Be Short-Lived Supply disruptions due to the pandemic are occurring, but there is the potential that these will be relatively short-lived, said Bryan Slusarchuk, CEO of Fosterville South Exploration. Mining companies will adapt safety and health protocols in an attempt to meet this challenge, and mining is an essential industry around the world, he said. “Safety and health always must remain the number one priority for mining companies, so the focus is on safe operations while mining to provide the critical materials that all of us need.” Good Environment For Gold From a precious metals perspective, the environment has never been better for gold, Slusarchuk said. “Gold has been a store of wealth, a currency and a hedge against uncertainty for thousands of years and, geopolitically, monetarily and socially, there is an extreme amount of uncertainty out there.” Price Action The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was down 1.8% at $158.80 at the close Thursday, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was down 5.2% at $32.26 Related Links: Gold Analyst Says Rally Is Short-Term, Prices Will Recede To $1,600 By Year's End Barrick Gold Reports Q2 Earnings Beat"
2020-05-18,"Strategist Expects Gold, Silver To Gain As Pandemic Panic Subsides","Gold and silver prices rallied Monday amid market strength as news from a Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) trial stoked optimism about a potential coronavirus vaccine. On Monday, June gold futures were trading at $1,733 and July Comex silver prices were at $17.39 per ounce. “Gold and gold stocks had a strong month, recovering all of their March losses and moving to long-term highs,” Joe Foster, portfolio manager and strategist at VanEck, said in a note. Hedging With Gold As the pandemic market panic subsides, investors are trying to gauge the risks and opportunities in a world that carries a level of uncertainty that only those with memories of the Great Depression and World War II have experienced, the VanEck strategist said. “Continued strong inflows to bullion exchange traded products along with strong demand for retail coins indicates both institutions and individuals are turning to gold as a store of value and hedge against uncertainty,” Foster said. On April 9, gold jumped $40 per ounce when the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled its $2.3-trillion program to aid local governments and small- and mid-sized businesses. “It [gold] went on to a new seven-year high of $1,747 per ounce on 14 April, then consolidated its gains around the $1,700 level. Gold ended the month at $1,686 per ounce for a $109 (6.9%) gain,” he said. Banks 'Can't Arbitrarily Print' Gold The trillions being injected into the economy via quantitative easing alongside monetary and fiscal stimuli devalues and debases paper currency, said Bryan Slusarchuk, CEO of Fosterville South Exploration. “Gold is the only currency that central banks can't arbitrarily print more of, and as such it is the only currency that acts with stability during a time of crisis,” he said. With more and more paper currency in circulation, the currencies become inherently worth less and less, the CEO said. Price Action The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was down 0.57% at $163 at the time of publication Monday, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was down 1.56% at $36.

2020-05-19,"3 Gold Miners ETFs Your Probably Don't Know About, But Should Get To  Know","Gold is one of this year's best performing commodities and that's a theme that could extend as exchange traded fund demand swells and as central banks debase currencies. That's good news for gold miners ETFs, which are already among 2020's leading industry funds. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest fund in the category, is rewarding investors taking a chance on what's usually a volatile product. The fund is higher by nearly 23% year to date. GDX and its small-cap counterpart — the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) — have a way of crowding out the other ETFs in this group, but some of the other undiscovered funds here are turning in great performances in their own rights. With that in mind, here are some hidden gems of the gold miners ETF space to consider. Sprott Gold Miners ETF (SGDM) The Sprott Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:SGDM), which has recently been making a series of all-time highs, is an odd choice for an overlooked because it's neither small nor young. Just a couple of months shy of its sixth birthday, SGDM has $240.5 million in assets under management. The fund is a departure from cap-weighted rivals such as GDX. SGDM follows the Solactive Gold Miners Custom Factors Index, which focuses on “larger-sized gold companies with the highest revenue growth, free cash flow yield and the lowest long-term debt to equity,” according to the issuer. Low debt, well-capitalized firms, regardless of industry, are rewarding investors this year and that's true in the precious metals mining space as SGDM is higher by 24% year to date. U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (GOAU) The U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE:GOAU) is truly unique among its gold mining ETF rivals because it blends exposure to production firms with royalty operators, which are passive participants in the industry. Royalty and streaming companies comprise about a third of GOAU's index. The fund follows the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners Index, which is rooted in quantitative analysis. There are some perks to the royalty exposure including reduced volatility, higher dividends and lower operating costs. GOAU is higher by almost 29% over the past month. Global X Gold Explorers ETF (GOEX) At nearly 10 years old, the Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE:GOEX) is one of the oldest products in this category and it's experiencing a renaissance this year as confirmed by a 27.49% surge over the past month. GOEX components have a weighted average market value of $1.98 billion, making this a small-cap play on gold explorers. That's a volatile combination, but it's one that can pay off if both gold and smaller stocks remain simultaneously remain firm."
2020-06-03,'Fast Money' Traders Weigh In On Gold,"On CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report, Meghan Shue said that short-term fundamentals suggest a mixed outlook for gold in the near term. She would look for a better entry point. Joe Terranova said he always likes to have gold in his portfolio because it offers diversification. He added that in the current environment, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) would work better than SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Pete Najarian also likes the miners and he would consider individual names that provide exposure to gold. He currently owns SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (NYSE:XME), which has a mix of metals and gold names."
2020-06-12,"Gold Rally Stalls As Prices Settle Around $1,700, Analyst Expects Further Pullback","A gold rally that followed the Federal Reserve's signal of no interest rate hikes through at least 2022 was dissipating Friday. The price of gold was around $1,735 at the time of publication. Gold's Safe Haven Rally: This year’s rally in gold has come on the back of a coronavirus-led surge in safe-haven buying and a plunge in interest rate expectations, according to Capital Economics. “We suspect that the uptick in the gold price has come from investors positioning themselves against the risk of inflation, though we don’t expect it to pick up much in the short term. As such, we think the gold price will fall back by year-end,” Capital Economics commodities economist James O'Rourke said in a research note. The analyst expects gold will come under pressure from fading safe-haven demand, falling to $1,600 per ounce by year-end. “We expect U.S. interest rates to remain at their lower bound going forward, so the gold price is unlikely to benefit from a further fall in rate expectations anytime soon. And unless the virus takes a turn for the worse, we think safe-haven demand will wane too as the global economy recovers, ultimately weighing on the gold price,” O'Rourke said. Temporary Pullback In Gold? Bryan Slusarchuk, CEO of Fosterville South (FSXLF:OTC), said the underlying fundamentals for gold are extremely strong: quantitative easing infinity, a low-to-negative interest rate environment and unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimuli. “Paper currency is being devalued both intentionally and unintentionally and the result will be higher values ascribed to the only currency that can’t be printed, the CEO said. Slusarchuk said this “temporary pullback” is a combination of profit -aking and continued strength through Thursday in the U.S. market. “When the larger markets level out or correct, and the underlying factors supporting gold strength become more broadly known, gold will take the next leg up in what is a once in a generation gold bull market en route,” he said. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.49% at $163.19 at last check, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 0.43% at $32.97.

2020-06-22,What Does A 'Second Wave' Of COVID-19 Mean For Investors?,"The stock market recovery made more progress on Friday, but the latest COVID-19 data is increasingly raising concerns that a second wave (or just another crest of the first wave) of infections could be imminent as the U.S. economy opens back up. If those concerns ultimately result in another economic lockdown, some of the best-performing stocks since the March bottom could once again take the biggest hits. On Thursday, the U.S. reported 27,700 new coronavirus cases, and the seven-day average for new cases is up 15% compared to a week ago. Cases in 27 different states are up at least 5% week-over-week, according to Johns Hopkins University. If the U.S. economic reopening gets derailed or a second wave of COVID-19 slams the nation, it’s likely many of the same stocks that underperformed during the initial downturn will also be hit by a second wave of selling. Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter. Strongest And Weakest COVID-19 Stocks By far the hardest-hit sector of the market from the February peak to the March bottom was the energy sector. From Feb. 19 to March 23, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) dropped 57%, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Explore & Prod. (NYSE:XOP) dropped 60.5% and the VANECK VECTORS /OIL SVCS ETF NEW (NYSE:OIH) declined 70%. While the selling was broad-based during that time, some market sectors held up relatively well, especially compared to energy stocks. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was down just 26.2%, the Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR (NYSE:XLP) was down 24.5% and the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (NASDAQ:IBB) was down 21%. If a second wave of coronavirus once again results in a steep drop off in oil demand, underperforming stocks like TechnipFMC PLC (NYSE:FTI) and Noble Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBL) could be some of the hardest hit. In addition, cruise stocks like Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH) and Carnival Corp (NYSE:CCL) were also among the worst-performing stocks during the initial wave of coronavirus infections. Finally, retail stocks like Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) and Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) were crushed during the first round of brick-and-mortar store closings. Benzinga’s Take The economic and market reaction to a potential second wave of COVID-19 outbreaks will ultimately hinge on two factors. The severity of the wave will likely be the primary factor, but the willingness (or potential lack thereof) of business leaders, politicians and consumers to shut down the country a second time will also play an important role in the economic impact of a possible second wave of coronavirus.

2020-07-08,"Gold Passes $1,800 Mark For The First Time Since 2011, ETFs See Increased Inflows","Gold prices surpassed the $1,800 mark for the first time since 2011 on Wednesday as a resurgence in coronavirus infections sends investors toward safe haven investments. The Gold Landscape: The environment is still looking very good for gold and gold miners, Arnaud du Plessis, portfolio manager specializing in precious metals and natural resources at CPR Asset Management, says in an emailed note. “Central banks are staying on full alert as the resurgence of COVID-19 in some parts of the world is creating fears of a second-wave. This unique situation is generating growing interest in the barbarous relic, in the form of both the physical metal and gold-mining stocks able to offer investors potentially very significant performance leverage,” says Plessis. The profit outlook for the gold mining sector is continuing to improve, he says “Twelve-month profits have been revised up by more than 84% year on year, thus supporting the market trend. The substantial upwards revision of the average gold prices forecast for 2020, which now stand at $1,670/oz versus $1,554/oz at the end of March and $1,500/oz at the start of the year, have contributed to this trend.” Gold-Backed ETF Assets: The enthusiasm for physical gold is as strong as ever judging by the exponential growth in total gold-backed ETF assets, which reached new heights in June at 3,201 tonnes, says Plessis. “The equivalent of 86 tonnes was added in June, for example 622 tonnes since the start of the year, close to the record set in 2009 (644 tonnes for the full year). Note that the 385 tonne increase in assets in the second quarter of 2020 is the largest since 2016, “ adds Plessis. Fosterville South (OTC:FSXLF) CEO Bryan Slusarchuk says gold is a store of wealth, a hedge against uncertainty and a currency. We are in a period of quantitative easing infinity and are seeing monetary and fiscal stimuli like never before. There is huge printing of all paper currencies right now and as the saying goes, the Fed can’t print more gold. So, inherently, gold is becoming more valuable every day,” he says. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.63% at $170.10 at last check, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 1.78% at $38.40.

2020-07-19,Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead: 'Cautious Attitude',"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “U.S. stocks are closing in on record highs. But behind the scenes, uneasy investors are keeping their options open,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment officer for Ally Financial Inc-owned (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “They’ve bought gold at a historical pace, boosting the metal’s price to nine-year highs. Same goes for Treasuries, which is why yields are at all-time lows. Lately, we’ve seen that cautious attitude spread to the U.S. options market. A gauge of market worry (the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX) is stuck at higher-than-average levels, even though stocks are hovering just below their own highs.” Remember This: You have monetary and fiscal policy pushing the economy out of a problem and that is very, very bullish, said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Investment Management. When you have these extreme accommodative policies it is because there is a problem in the economy. Investors historically focus on the problem and are cautious, yet that’s when you want to get most optimistic. Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices balanced higher last week, as seen in the responsive, tight trading range. Recapping Last Week’s Action: On Monday, the S&P 500 gapped higher, outside of a prior balance area, but failed to continue, rotating back into the prior week’s range. Tuesday’s session continued Monday’s selling activity, but reversed just short of the prior balance area low. After news that Moderna Inc’s (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine produced antibodies, Wednesday’s session saw prices pushing higher, gapping beyond Tuesday’s range. Buyers attempted to burst through the resting liquidity at $3,230, but failed with prices later following the Nasdaq’s relative weakness lower to close the overnight gap. After some mixed economic data, Thursday's session was dominated by responsive activity, balancing out near Wednesday’s V-bottom low, with sellers lacking conviction the most via the minimal excess low. Alongside monthly options expiry, Friday’s session continued Thursday’s tone, with the intraday trading range remaining tight and responsive. Looking beyond broad market indices, the innovation-driven, technology-based sectors are showing signs of relative weakness, while other sectors, such as industrials, energy and financials are rotating higher off recent support. Overall, the market is in a three-day balance that it’s likely to break come next week.

2020-07-28,3 Unheralded Gold ETFs That Are On Fire,"Precious metals, namely gold and silver, are in the midst of epic rallies. On Monday, silver exchange-traded funds extended what are becoming meteoric rises while gold hit an all-time high. On volume that was nearly double the daily average, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest bullion-backed ETF, jumped 2%. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) joined the party, too, gaining almost 5% on above-average turnover, extending its year-to-date gain to roughly 50%. Indeed, these are exciting times for gold ETFs, an arena largely dominated by GLD and GDX. However, there are some other options for investors to consider here. Let's have a look at a few here. GraniteShares Gold Trust (BAR) In the U.S., the market for physically-backed gold ETFs is mostly dominated by the aforementioned GLD, but there are some admirable competitors. One of those is the GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR). GLD is a fine choice for active traders that need tight spread, deep liquidity and a robust options market. For longer-term investors looking for cost savings, BAR and a couple of other names are the way to go. In fact, BAR, which turns three years old next month, touched of a gold ETF fee war when it debuted in August 2017. The fund charges 0.1749% per year, or $17.49 on a $10,000 investment, making it one of the least expensive funds in this category. That's meaningful as highlighted by BAR's $1.1 billion in assets under management. More importantly, the fund is up 27.73% year-to-date and hit an all-time high yesterday. U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (GOAU) Much GLD looming large in the gold-backed ETF arena, the aforementioned GDX does the same among miners funds, but the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE:GOAU) is a credible idea to consider. GOAU, which hit an all-time high Monday, devotes 30% of its weight to the three largest gold royalty companies. The remaining 70% of the ETF's weight is allocated to 25 miners scored by momentum in revenue, free cash flow and high-gross margins on a per-share. GOAU hit $100 million in assets early this month, about a month after celebrating its third birthday. VanEck Merk Gold Trust (OUNZ) The VanEck Merk Gold Trust (NYSE:OUNZ) recently had its fee clipped to 0.25% from 0.40%. OUNZ is one of the niftier ideas in the gold ETF space because when an investor sells shares of the ETF, he or she can take physical delivery of gold, a trait not offered by rival funds in this category. OUNZ gained almost 2% yesterday on volume that was nearly triple the daily average on its way to a record high."
2020-08-03,Gold Just Hit An All-Time (Nominal) High—How To Play The Trade With ETFs,"Gold bugs who were in front of their screens on Sunday night witnessed history for the second week in a row. At the 6 pm ET open on August 2, the spot price of gold rose to $2009.50 per ounce, a new all-time high on a nominal (non-inflation adjusted) basis. It was the second week in a row that gold made a new all-time high in the Sunday night session, as the same thing happened the evening of July 26. Spot gold is up almost 36% over the previous 12 months, a stunning turnaround for an asset that drastically underperformed equities for the last decade. For those investors who stayed the course and the traders who’ve been betting on upside, Sunday night was validation. So why did gold just make a new all-time high? It’s 2020—the real question is why not? The safe-haven asset has the benefit of several macro tailwinds playing out at the same time. The EU’s record-breaking $858 billion bailout package combined with near-zero interest rates from global central banks has signaled that monetary easing and fiscal stimulus will be more than a short-term reality. At the same time, rising tensions last week between the U.S. and China has set the stage for another geopolitical showdown, which carries with it far more unknowns than any market (or person, for that matter) should be comfortable with. And all this is to say nothing of the fact that coronavirus cases continue to rise in the U.S. How To Play Gold Via ETFs As gold has ascended in recent months so too have gold ETFs, as many traders and investors use them to get exposure. According to the World Gold Council, gold-backed ETFs added $5.6 billion worth of assets in June, their seventh consecutive month of global positive flows. And based on July’s performance, that streak could continue. Take the two largest gold miners ETFs by assets: the VanEck Vectors® Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX, )) and the VanEck Vectors® Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ, )). The pair has returned 42% and 38% respectively in 2020, as of August 3. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of GDX (candles) compared with GDXJ (purple line). Source: Benzinga Pro; Data as of August 3, 2020 The strength in GDX can be attributed to names like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corp (NYSE:FNV), and Wheaton Precious Metals Corp (NYSE:WPM). Combined, the group makes up over 38% of the fund and is up an average of 60% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the strength in GDXJ can be attributed to top holdings Gold Fields Ltd (NYSE:GFI) (up 98% YTD), Kinross Gold Corp (NYSE:KGC) (up 97%), and Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE:AUY) (up 64%), which combine to make up nearly 17% of the fund. For investors interested in gold bullion, the VanEck® Merk® Gold Trust (NYSE:OUNZ) actually allows investors to own physical gold via their ownership of the ETF and even take delivery of the gold they own, if desired. Note that taking delivery of gold does come with a fee. In short, market risk is very much on. And when risk is on, so is gold."
2020-08-04,How To Play Gold's Recent Surge Right Now: Don't Buy Gold?,"Gold managed to break above a nine-year base and completed its best monthly gain since 2016. So what's the best way to play the surging commodity? Wheaton Precious Idea: The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) has outperformed the physical commodity but has since become a little bit overbought, Piper Sandler senior technical research analyst Craig Johnson said on CNBC. If the ETF pulls back, it might be good to buy on the dip and investors may want to consider diversifying to other names. One idea is Wheaton Precious Metals Corp (NYSE:WPM), Johnson said. The stock remains in an uptrend from March lows and showing no signs of breaking down. The relative strength has also been nicely improving. As I go through our entire work that we got where we basically break down the entire marketplace into relative strength rankings, the gold, mining [and] silver groups are all making 26-week relative strength new highs and absolute new highs inside of our work, he said. I think as a technician and investors, you can't really ignore that. Related Link: Gold Just Hit An All-Time (Nominal) High—How To Play The Trade With ETFs What About Copper? Gold has not proven to be a good hedge against inflation compared to stocks, Laffer Tengler Chief Investment Officer Nancy Tengler also said. Gold is more akin to a safety play but metals like copper is a leading indicator on the economy. We think this is bullish for the economy and we also think it's bullish for stocks, she said. But as the political calendar start to take over, Tengler said the commodity could see a correction followed up with a move to higher levels."

2020-08-24,3 Gold ETFs Seeing Brisk Short Covering Activity,"Thanks in large part to demand by investors opting for gold exchange-traded funds, gold is one of this year's hottest assets. However, the yellow metal, like any other security, doesn't move up in a straight line. The largest gold ETF enters Monday 6.39% off its 52-week high after trading modestly lower last week. Two interesting things to consider here. First, gold ETFs dipped last week even amid rampant short covering. Second, there's a massive amount of short interest in some marquee gold ETFs to be unwound. Three gold ETFs “landed in the top ten most short covered ETFs league table over the last week with $160 million worth of new buy-to-covers. Gold’s +28% move for the year and hitting its year to date high in early August may be squeezing some Gold ETF short sellers out of their positions,” according to S3 Partners research. Here are those three ETFs. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Up almost 40% this year, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is chastening bearish traders. Last week, the largest gold miners resisted the commodity's decline, rising 1.34% on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) took a stake in Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). That stock is GDX's second-largest component at a weight of just over 12%. More than $90 million of short interest in GDX was covered last week, but short interest as a percentage of the ETF's float is still close to 10% and valued at $1.76 billion, according to S3, meaning it will take some time for shorts to cover this trade. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) is the largest physically-backed gold ETF and a favorite of professional traders on both sides of the bullish/bearish spectrum, owing to robust liquidity and tight spreads. Traders covered almost $30 million worth of GLD shorts last week, but there's still $2.62 billion of short interest in the benchmark gold ETF, equivalent to 3.37% of the fund's float, notes S3. As is the case with GDX, it's likely to take bearish traders weeks, not days, to unwind that GLD short. iShares Gold Trust (IAU) Traders covered almost $40 million worth of bearish exposure in the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) last week, whittling short interest in that ETF $93.57 million. That's just 0.30% of the float, indicating those shorts could cover in rapid fashion if need be. “Short sellers in these three Gold ETFs are down -$760 million in year-to-date mark-to-market losses,” notes S3. Dislcosure: The author owns shares of IAU."
2020-08-26,"Here's How Much Investing $1,000 In The GDX Gold Miners ETF In 2010 Would Be Worth Today","Investors who owned stocks in the 2010s generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500's (NYSE:SPY) total return for the decade was 250.5%. But there’s no question some popular investments did much better than others along the way. Gold Miners’ Difficult Decade: One lagging performer in the last decade was the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). The GDX ETF started out the 2010s trading at around $47.70. For the first year and a half of the decade, gold prices were on fire, rallying from around $1,100 per ounce to as high as $1,923/oz in mid-2011. Investors were scooping up gold on concerns that the massive stimulus action taken by the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 would eventually lead to significant inflation. Unfortunately for gold investors, that inflation never materialized and the $1,923 level represented peak gold prices of the 2010s. Given the GDX trades largely in-line with gold spot prices, the fund peaked in mid-2011 at $66.98, its decade high. Sluggish inflation numbers, 0% interest rates and steady economic growth over the next several years made gold an afterthought for many investors. The GDX fund drifted steadily lower over the next four years, eventually bottoming out at $12.40 in early 2016. Gold prices spiked in early 2016 to new two-year highs, and the GDX fund followed suit, peaking at $31.79 in mid-2016. The breakout coincided with concerns over the impact of a surprising Brexit vote in Europe. GDX In 2020 And Beyond: After initially dropping to $16.18 during the market sell-off in March, the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent stimulus efforts once again have the GDX trading higher. The fund recently hit $45, its highest level since 2013. Despite the recent rally, the GDX fund hasn’t been a particularly great overall investment in the past decade. In fact, $1,000 GDX shares in 2010 would be worth about $861.10 today, assuming reinvested dividends. The good news for GDX investors is that if the fund continues to follow its 2008 financial crisis pattern, it will not peak for more than two years after the stock market bottom in March of 2020.

2020-10-31,Gold Price Predictions If Biden Or Trump Wins Presidency,"The 2020 U.S. election is taking place on Nov. 3 with President Donald Trump and former VIce President Joe Biden battling for the lead position. Gold Price Analysis: The U.S. presidential election will play a huge role in shaping the global economy and gold prices are expected to react in the run up to the election day. So how important is it for the safe haven asset gold if Biden or Trump makes it to the White House? “There is no doubt that we are likely to see increased volatility in stock markets in the run up to the election day and investors seeking traditional safe havens such as gold, particularly if the race between the two candidates gets very close and there is a growing risk of a contested outcome,” writes Saida Litosh, manager of precious metals analysis at Refinitiv. Biden or Trump Impact: If the past is any indication, a second Trump administration would mean a “turbulent and polarizing first term” which in turn would add further volatility and uncertainty, although the potential for radical policies could be lower in the second term should Congress remain divided, Refinitiv highlights. However, a Biden win would represent a return to a more conventional administration resulting in less volatility associated with political risks and international tensions. “Historically gold price movements in the aftermath of previous U.S. presidential elections suggests little evidence of a clear relationship between the gold price and the election outcome based on party affiliation,” says Litosh. Fosterville South Exploration CEO Bryan Slusarchuk says, for thousands of years, gold has acted as a hedge against uncertainty, a currency and a store of wealth. Both Trump and Biden have promised huge amounts of stimulus and huge amounts of easing. Both [Trump and Biden] have been vocally supportive of various policies that amount to quantitative easing and therefore gold ought to react well no matter who is elected,” says Slusarchuk. Stepping beyond financial conditions, which will serve to propel gold higher, we need to consider gold’s function as a hedge against uncertainty, says Slusarchuk. Gold Has Explosive Upside: Slusarchuk says this election is going to be perhaps the most divisive election in the history of the United States. It may be contested, the outcome may not be certain and its legitimacy will no doubt be challenged in some circles no matter which side is victorious,” says Slusarchuk. He believes a bitter, contested election would also potentially have many negative consequences and would represent the very definition of uncertainty which is something gold hedges against. I believe gold has explosive upside in the coming months and this is predicated on economic and financial conditions, but the uncertainty of the election outcome will only serve to accelerate its upward trajectory,” adds Slusarchuk. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.37% at $179 at the time of publication Monday, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 0.89% at $38.55."
2020-11-02,Carter Worth And Mike Khouw's GDX Options Trade,"Carter Worth of Cornerstone Macro spoke on CNBC's Options Action about assets that could provide safety in the current environment. Investors who want safety should look at gold and gold miners, instead of bonds and treasuries, thinks Worth. He would be a buyer of VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Etf (NYSE:GDX) because he thinks the pullback is over and the next direction for the stock should be up. Worth sees the recent price action as consolidation after a big move higher. GDX bottomed in March at $16, peaked in August at $46 and then it pulled back to its current price of $36. The pullback is a third of the move higher and Worth explained that stocks often find support after such a pullback. Mike Khouw wants to sell options to finance a bullish bet because of the high near-term implied volatility. He wants to sell the November 20, $36 put for $1.15 and the November 20, $40 call for $0.65. He would also buy the January $15, $38 call for $2.60. The total cost for the trade would be $0.80 and if the stock stays between $36 and $40 at the November expiration, the puts Khouw sold are going to expire worthless and his long call would have a breakeven at $38.80."
2020-11-04,Should You Invest In Gold Right Now?,"The price of gold is up 24.2% year-to-date in one of the most tumultuous years in history so far. With the possibility of a contested U.S. presidential election and a worsening pandemic in the coming weeks, things could become even more volatile on Wall Street, leading some investors to consider buying gold as a potential hedge against stock market weakness. There are plenty of reasons to invest in gold heading into the final two months of 2020 — and plenty of reasons not to. Here's an overview of the bull and bear cases. Related: Is Gold A Good Investment? Bull Case For Gold: The bull case for gold is that it's considered a stable hedge against inflation. The U.S. government has already issued more than $2 trillion in economic stimulus this year, and a potential blue wave on Tuesday would likely open the door for trillions more in Democratic stimulus in the first quarter of 2021. Inflation rates have lagged the Federal Reserve’s 2% target rate for more than a decade, but all this money printing may catch up to the U.S. dollar at some point. If inflation spikes, gold prices will too, and gold investors will be protected from the fallout. The last time the Federal Reserve issued massive stimulus measures was during the financial crisis in 2009. Gold prices rallied from under $700 per ounce in late 2008 to as high as $1,923.70 in mid-2011. If history is any indication, the 2020 rally in gold prices could continue for at least another year or two. Bear Case For Gold: Legendary investor Warren Buffett has done a great job of explaining the bear case against investing in gold. Unlike stocks or bonds that produce earnings, generate interest or pay dividends, gold has very little actual utility. “Gold will never produce anything ... it doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you,” Buffett once said. To make matters worse, the world’s supply of gold is constantly growing. Although there is a finite amount of gold on the planet, the amount of gold available to buy and sell is increasing by more than 3,000 metric tons per year. The final case against gold is its historical performance. Since the beginning of 1990, the price of gold is up just 372.1% compared to a more than 1,700% total return from the S&P 500 in that time. How To Play Gold: The most popular way to invest in gold is the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), which tracks a gold spot price based on gold bars held in London vaults. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is a fund that holds a diversified portfolio of 54 gold mining companies. Investors can also buy individual gold mining stocks, such as Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) and Franco Nevada Corp (NYSE:FNV)."
2020-11-06,Gold Prices Surge As Dollar Drops,"Gold has been benefiting from a weak U.S. dollar and the uncertainty of the U.S. election outcome, with Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the lead but no election calls yet. Gold made gains this week and was trading at $1,952.28 per ounce at last check Friday. While the potential election of Joe Biden means a lot to various segments of the capital markets, I think the cake was baked for gold long before the vote, said Fosterville South Exploration CEO Bryan Slusarchuk . Bull Market For Gold: Regardless of who wins the election, the setup for a once-in-a-lifetime bull market in gold was in place due to bipartisan support for quantitative easing, unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus and a low-to-negative interest rate policy, said Slusarchuk. Gold is a currency, and right now it is the only currency in the world not being printed with reckless abandon in an effort to stave off a huge financial depression, he said. Therefore, inherently gold is becoming more valuable versus its competitors every day. I expect this to continue because quite simply the Fed can’t print more gold. As the uncertainty around the election continues, gold's strength over the mid- and long-term is underpinned by economic and financial conditions. “There is no doubt we may see some short-term fluctuations based on the extreme animosity between the two sides during the counting phase of the election and the fact that the election is being contested,” Slusarchuk said. The climate represents the best set of conditions for gold ever seen, the CEO said. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.14% at $183.19 at the close Friday. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 0.49% at $41.42. Related Link: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now?"
2020-11-17,"Q3 13F Roundup: How Buffett, Einhorn, Ackman And Others Adjusted Their Portfolios","The latest round of 13F filings from institutional investors is out, revealing to the world the stocks that some of the richest and most successful investors have been buying and selling. Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The third quarter of 2020 was an overall solid quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling heading into the holiday shopping season. Fund managers were dumping FANG stocks in the first quarter with a handful of exceptions. For example, Cooperman bought Alphabet. PG&E was one stock several fund managers were playing in the quarter. Tepper and Klarman were buying while Soros was selling. Buffett was aggressively buying health care stocks ahead of Joe Biden’s election victory. Bank stocks were popular among fund managers in the quarter, with most managers selling rather than buying. Cooperman sold JPMorgan, Buffett sold JPMorgan and Wells Fargo and bought Bank of America, and Soros sold Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Eingorn sold the GDX gold miners ETF and bought the GLD gold ETF. Soros made a big bet on tech stocks by buying the QQQ ETF and dumping the IGSB corporate bond fund. Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

2020-11-22,VanEck Report Says Bitcoin Less Volatile Than Many Stocks,"Bitcoin might be less volatile than some stocks, a study by VanEck shows. What Happened: Investment management firm VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Etf (NYSE:GDX) published a research paper on Friday comparing Bitcoin volatility to stock volatility. Volatility of the cryptocurrency has been linked to regulations, sensitivity to small total market size, and limited penetration in mainstream stock and capital markets, wrote the author of the paper, Gabor Gurbacs, VanEck's director of digital assets strategy. But, according to the paper, 145 stocks in the S&P 500 have had more price fluctuations year-to-date than the cryptocurrency has had this year. It also said Bitcoin demonstrated less 90-day volatility than 112 stocks on the S&P 500. Why It Matters: Crypto assets are often viewed as the most volatile assets since the subprime derivatives that brought about the Great Recession. The volatility is believed to be one of the main reasons institutional investors have hesitated to get involved. VanEck, a New York-based fund that manages about $50 billion in assets, launched an exclusive Bitcoin ETF product for its clients in 2019 and also has filed with the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF. Price Action: Bitcoin has been trading in the $18,400 range today. VanEck shares closed at $35.90, with a 1.07% gain, on Friday."
2020-11-30,"With Coronavirus Vaccine In Reach, Gold Faces Worst Month In 4 Years","The announcement of a vaccine protecting against COVID-19 has seen investor risk appetite rise, sending safe haven assets, including gold and the U.S. dollar, lower. The yellow metal is on track for the worst month in four years after trading at around $1,800 since mid-July. On Monday, gold was trading at $1,776. The price of gold will rise a touch as U.S. real yields fall a little further, said Capital Economics assistant commodities economist Samuel Burman. The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in China will offset any vaccine-induced boost to metals demand in 2021, the economist said. Is Gold’s Bull Market Over? The gold industry is exceptionally strong and is attracting both growth-oriented and value investors, says Fosterville South Exploration CEO Bryan Slusarchuk. It is one of the few sectors in the world that has a strong outlook for growing cash flows and growing margins in the year ahead, he said. The macro setup for gold represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for gold bulls, and it should be pointed out that when gold bullion prices are strong, gold equities often outperform the price of the metal itself, Slusarchuk says. While 2020 will be rightfully remembered for the terrible pandemic that ripped across the globe, it also marks the first time that there was near worldwide consensus amongst politicians from all political parties as it relates to spending and bigger government as a solution to cure all economic ills.” Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) lost 0.67% Monday, closing at $166.67. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) gained 1.31%, closing at $34.68. Related Link: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now?"
2020-12-03,"New ETNs Bring Leverage, Spice To Gold Miners","Gold is hot this year and the miners are even hotter, a scenario bringing more light to the various leveraged exchange traded products that provide access to the companies extracting gold from the earth. What Happened: In other words, it's a good time for traders to consider some fresh approaches to bullion miners. REX Shares, the issuer behind the MicroSectors lineup of leveraged exchange traded notes, has those traders covered with a pair of new exchange traded notes (ETNs). The MicroSectors Gold Miners Leveraged 3X ETN (NYSE:GDXU) and the MicroSectors Gold Miners -3X Inverse Leveraged ETN (NYSE:GDXD) launch Thursday, joining well-known products, such as the MicroSectors™ FANG+™ Index 3X Leveraged ETN (NYSE:FNGU) and the MicroSectors™ FANG+™ ETN (NYSE:FNGS) in the MicroSectors stable. Why It's Important: GDXU and GDXD, the new geared gold ETNs, bring a unique approach. The products track the S-Network MicroSectors™ Gold Miners Index. That benchmark is a combination of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ), the two largest non-leveraged bullion miners ETFs by assets. The index is half allocated to the large-cap GDX and half allocated to the small-cap GDXJ. “Each ETN offers investors a return based on changes in the level of the S-Network MicroSectors™ Gold Miners Index on a daily compounded basis, before taking into account fees. Each ETN has a specified leverage factor that is reset daily,” according to MicroSectors. What's Next: Obviously, as leveraged products, GDXU and the bearish GDXD are expected to pack a punch, but that's certainly the case with these products because, on an unleveraged basis, miners are typically volatile bets. GDX has a three-year standard deviation of 33.23%, well above that of broader equity benchmarks and standard industry funds. The small-cap GDXJ has a three-year standard deviation of 38.68%, making it far more volatile than any traditional small-cap benchmark and confirming the MicroSectors ETNs could thrive when action heats up in the miners complex. With the debuts of GDXU and GDXD, MicroSectors offers over 21 ETNs, spanning FANG stocks, big banks, the energy sector, and the first leveraged cannabis products to list in the U.S."
2020-12-08,Mike Khouw Sees Unusual Options Activity In Newmont Corporation,"On CNBC's Options Action, Mike Khouw said calls outpaced puts in Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) by about 2.5 to 1 and the most active options on Monday were the January $65 calls, as 2,800 contracts were traded for $1.50. Buyers of these calls are betting Newmont will trade above $66.50 by the January expiration, which is 8.24% higher than the closing price on Monday. Khouw said he also noticed unusual options activity in VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and gold futures."
2021-01-22,VanEck Is Planning An Equity-Based ETF That's A Spin On Crypto,"There still isn't a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. When that's going to change is up for considerable debate, but in the meantime, investors have some other avenues to consider, including blockchain exchange-traded funds. What Happened: VanEck, an ETF issuer that's long had sights on a bitcoin ETF, is proposing another prescription: The VanEck Vectors Digital Assets ETF. The issuer revealed plans for the fund in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Digital asset companies may include small- and medium-capitalization companies and foreign and emerging market issuers, and the Fund may invest in depositary receipts and securities denominated in foreign currencies,” according to the filing. Why It's Important: Assuming it comes to market, the Digital Assets ETF will follow the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index. “To be initially eligible for inclusion in the Index, a company must generate at least 50% of its revenues from (i) digital assets projects or (ii) projects that, when developed, have the potential to generate at least 50% of their revenues from the digital assets industry,” according to the filing. “Companies with less than 50% of their revenues from the global digital assets segment, including semiconductor and online money transfer companies, may be added to the index to reach a minimum component number. Index component weights are based upon free-float market capitalization and individual components are limited to a maximum of an 8% weighting in the Index.” Information on the index is currently scant and the filing doesn't mention specific components. However, there are some qualifiers for membership, including “those that operate digital asset exchanges, payment gateways, mining operations, software services, equipment and technology or services to the digital asset industry, digital asset infrastructure businesses, or companies facilitating commerce with the use of digital assets, among others. They may also include companies which own a material amount of digital assets, or otherwise generate revenues related to digital asset operations.” What's Next: The filing does mention risks associated with investing in the financial services and technology sectors, indicating those groups could be found in the new ETF. On the other hand, the filing doesn't include a ticker or expense – signals that launch of the VanEck Digital Assets ETF isn't imminent."
2021-04-09,"The 'Boiler Room' Stock Pitch Recap: Northern Star Acquisition, Mogo, WISeKey, AutoZone And More","Every Friday, at 3 p.m. ET, Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown and Benzinga CEO Jason Raznick host The Boiler Room, a Clubhouse audio chat where listeners can pitch their favorite stock. Here are this week's pitches. Planet 13 Holdings (OTC:PLNHF) Planet 13 is a cannabis company based in Nevada. Aaron (@aaronpop) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Record revenue in March. The balance sheet is strong. Building numerous stores. You think it breaks out, Brown asked. I think it breaks out mid-Q2 or Q2 earnings but I wouldn’t be shocked if they get hit when the stock market drops again or there’s negative talk about federal legalization,” Aaron responded, giving the stock a $15-30 price target over a three- to five-year time horizon. Alpha Healthcare Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:AHAC) AHAC is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that plans to merge with Humacyte. Jackson (@jacksonalacarte) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Humacyte to go public in the summer. Minimal downside and cash in escrow. 5-year study to be presented April 20. Initiated at $20 by Lake Street Capital. You have this catalyst … and if the data is really bad, that would suck because the stock would trade down at least to where its cash-value is, Brown noted. The upside here is greater than anything else in the market,” Jackson responded. “I’m buying some today or Monday,” Raznick added. Northern Star Acquisition Corporation (NYSE:STIC) Northern Star is a SPAC that plans to merge with BarkBox, a subscription service provider of dog products and services. Marc (@miweber) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: 60% gross margin. 90% retention rate. Personalized offer. Merger in Q2 2021. There’s another one … and it hasn’t really been performing, Raznick said in reference to the industry losing the interest of Wall Street. We’re going to keep an eye on this one,” Brown added. Progyny Inc (NASDAQ:PGNY) Progyny is a benefits management company. Cesar (@juliuscesar_) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Fertility and family building offer. Earnings estimates look strong. Helping build and shape families. What’s their advantage, Brown asked. Their service has an outcome success rate of like 89% versus like 50% when it comes to regular insurance providers,” Cesar responded. Mogo Inc (NASDAQ:MOGO) MOGO is a mortgage loan company. Presley (@pretzel_pres) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Fintech company under the radar. Personal finance-based platform. JPMorgan says fintech is a threat. Similar to SoFi, impactful services. 90% of millennials using fintech. Bitcoin cash-back program offered. There are going to be probably four or five dozen fintech companies that all do some combination of extending credit, replacing physical bank payments, and so on; why would I buy MOGO, Brown asked. It is based in Canada so … they can dominate that market,” Presley responded. “The reason I got into Mogo — they reminded me of SoFi but based more in Canada,” Raznick added. “They’re acquiring assets, they want to be your credit card, … and they are making acquisitions.” WISeKey International Holding AG (NASDAQ:WKEY) WISeKey is a global cybersecurity company deploying digital identity ecosystems using blockchain. Rachel (@istomorrow) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Became involved with NFTs. Announced luxury auctions. Play on automation, drones. Putting chips inside drones. I interviewed the CEO and he was comparing it to Palantir. He said the reason their stock is not moving in the right direction is that they are a Swiss company and it’s hard for them to get credit, even though they have the same know-how and platforms, Raznick said. Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) Louisiana-Pacific is a building materials manufacturer. Gabe (@gabealessi) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Diversified offer and global. 4 consecutive earnings beats. Breakout and bullish chart. Secular play, housing boom. This is like a homebuilding play … and there is a danger that this is priced in, Brown noted. “I think we’re under-housed and in a secular market for millennial household formation. I would wait for a red day and use the rising 200-day as my trailing stop.” AutoZone Inc (NYSE:AZO) AutoZone is a retailer of aftermarket automotive parts and accessories. Matthew (@ithacawealth) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Chip shortage, fewer new cars. Used cars to remain attractive. Boosting margins, room to grow. Why would you buy this instead of O’Reilly’s, Brown asked. Best in class management and stock is making new highs,” Matthew responded. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) GDX is a gold miners ETF. Mike (@nycmike) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Depressed, $31 acted as support. Positioned for a technical move up. Why would I buy GDX versus buying the GLD ETF, Brown asked. The $31 level is a clear line and [GDX] has that upside to it,” Mike responded. PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) PepsiCo is a multinational food, snack, and beverage company. Chris (@cpcapital) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Retooling and divesting from bad companies. Potential to develop multi-year partnerships. Taking cash and investing in new opportunities. They make all their money on food products. Are you owning it as a long-term investment, Raznick asked. I think they manage to execute regardless of the environment ... and I think it flys into the summer,” Chris responded. AmeriCold Realty Trust (NYSE:COLD) Americold is a publicly-traded REIT. Malcolm (@malcolmwestt) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Facilities hold products for supermarkets. Storage for pharmaceutical companies. Do you foresee the stock continuing to work in a different environment than 2020, Brown asked. I do believe demand will fall a little bit but Americold has been buying up different companies, Malcolm responded. They bought 62 warehouses in Brazil … and have facilities spread out through Europe. Photo by Anna Nekrashevich from Pexels."
2021-04-11,Mike Khouw Lays Out Gold Play Through GDX Trade,"Mike Khouw suggested on CNBC's Options Action a bullish options trade in VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). Gold is one of the few risk assets that hasn't come along for the high-flying ride with everything else, said Khouw. While the market and risk assets are at all-time highs overall, gold certainly isn't, he said. Khouw sees opportunity in the underperforming gold as net-longs in the commodity have been increasing lately. Also, on a valuation basis, the gold miners are trading at lows they haven't seen since 2013, he said. To make a bullish bet, Khouw wants to buy the June $34/$39 call spread for $1.70. The trade breaks even at $35.70, or 2.79% above the closing price on Friday. If the stock jumps to $39 or higher, the trade is going to reach its maximal profit of $3.30."
2021-05-17,Options Traders See Stars Align For Gold Miners ETF,"VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) stock broke out Monday at the beginning of a seasonally bullish time for the gold sector. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and other cryptocurrencies were trading lower Monday. Bitcoin and gold often move inversely to each other as traders follow trends relative to which investment is a better store of value at a given time. Fears of inflation could also help gold to fly higher, as the metal is believed to offer protection against the probability of rising prices as the economy recovers from the pandemic. A number of options traders believe these three events could make gold miner stocks soar and bet over $1.56 million the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF will trade higher. The VanEck Vectors Trades: Below is a look at the notable options alerts courtesy of Benzinga Pro: At 9:42 a.m., Monday, a trader executed a call sweep near the ask of 2,156 VanEck Vectors options with a strike price of $38.50 expiring May 21. The trade represented a $116,424 bullish bet for which the trader paid 54 cents per option contract. At 9:48 a.m., a trader executed a call sweep near the ask of 641 VanEck Vectors options with a strike price of $40 expiring on Jan. 21. The trade represented a $224,350 bullish bet for which the trader paid $3.50 per option contract.

The trade represented a $498,465 bullish bet for which the trader paid $2.65 per option contract. At 10:55 a.m., a trader executed a call sweep, near the ask, of 5,000 VanEck Vectors options with a strike price of $44 expiring on June 18. The trade represented a $120,000 bullish bet for which the trader paid 24 cents per option contract. At 11:07 a.m., a trader executed a call sweep near the ask of 814 VanEck Vectors options with a strike price of $40 expiring on June 18. The trade represented a $105,006 bullish bet for which the trader paid $1.29 per option contract. At 11:08 a.m., a trader executed a call sweep, near the ask, of 1,308 VanEck Vectors options with a strike price of $40 expiring on July 16. The trade represented a $234,132 bullish bet for which the trader paid $1.79 per option contract. At 12:15 p.m., a trader executed a call sweep near the ask of 500 VanEck Vectors options with a strike price of $38 expiring on Sept. 17. The trade represented a $177,500 bullish bet for which the trader paid $3.55 per option contract. At 1:05 p.m., a trader executed a call sweep near the ask of 726 VanEck Vectors options with a strike price of $44 expiring on June 18. The trade represented a $98,010 bullish bet for which the trader paid $1.35 per option contract. Related Link: 3 Silver ETFs To Fight Inflation Why It’s Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays market price for the call option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position. GDX Price Action: Shares of VanEck Vectors were trading up 4.84% to $39.67 at last check Monday."

Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of 2021 was a big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling to kick off 2021. Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros and Klarman buying. ViacomCBS had a volatile quarter in part due to the unwinding of Archegos Capital, and fund managers took notice. Tepper and Soros were buying, while Klarman was selling. Buffett continued selling financial stocks and drug stocks and reversed course by selling Chevron just one quarter after taking a stake in the oil giant. Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite inflation fears, Einhorn sold the GLD gold fund while Soros reduced his exposure to emerging markets by selling the EEM fund. Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

2021-05-27,Are Gold Stocks Moving Back Into The Growth Phase?,"The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Etf (NYSE:GDX) has come back to life in recent months after a disappointing performance in the second half of 2020. On Thursday, Bank of America analyst Michael Jalonen said big gold stocks are currently transitioning to a period of significant production growth after a period focused on investment and capital returns. Jalonen highlighted the key themes among gold producers that attended Bank of America’s recent Global Metals, Mining & Steel virtual conference. Related Link: 10 Gold Stocks That Could Be The Next Buyout Targets In Industry Consolidation Wave “The key overarching theme: moving back into the growth phase,” Jalonen said. The Numbers: Some companies are much better positioned to grow production than others. Among all the gold stocks he covers, Jalonen said Wheaton Precious Metals Corp (NYSE:WPN) is projected to have the highest production growth over the next three years at about 30%. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. (NYSE:AEM) is a close second at just under 30%, followed by Franco Nevada Corp (NYSE:FNV) at around 25%. Jalonen said strong free cash flow is funding capital allocation priorities for Wheaton. For Agnico Eagle, Jalonen said the company is forging ahead with its proven long-term growth strategy. Franco-Nevada is a great stock for investors looking for a low-cost gold investment, Jalonen added. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $55 price target for Wheaton, a Buy rating and $80 target for Agnico Eagle, and a Buy rating and $163 target for Franco-Nevada. Even though Newcrest Mining ADR (OTC:NCMGY) has the lowest gold production growth outlook of the big gold group, Jalonen said the company has potentially hidden copper value. Benzinga’s Take: Gold prices are up just 9% in the past year, price action which is likely extremely disappointing for many investors given the more than $6 trillion in stimulus spending the U.S. government has performed in that time. For now, at least, it appears as though cryptocurrencies have taken the wind out of gold’s sails as the preferred inflation hedge among investors. (Photo: Jingming Pan via Unsplash)"
2021-06-17,Analyzing VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF's Unusual Options Activity,"On Thursday, shares of VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $35.69. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-08-20 Strike Price: $35.00 Volume: 889 Open Interest: 6581 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-06-28,Unusual Options Activity Insight: VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF,"Shares of VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) saw some unusual options activity on Monday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved down to $34.02. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-07-16 Strike Price: $33.50 Volume: 3960 Open Interest: 516 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Out of the money contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. Out of the money occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price.

2021-06-29,Understanding VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF's Unusual Options Activity,"VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved down to $33.73 following the option alert. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2022-01-21 Strike Price: $45.00 Volume: 752 Open Interest: 59230 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Out of the money contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. Out of the money occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-08-10,Mike Khouw Sees Unusual Options Activity In GDX,"On CNBC's Options Action, Mike Khouw said VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Etf (NYSE:GDX) traded two times its average daily put options volume on Monday. A lot of that activity was concentrated in the September 24, $28-strike puts as over 3,000 contracts were traded for 20 cents. Buyers of these puts are betting GDX could decline below $27.80, which would represent a decline of more than 14%."
2021-08-22,Carter Worth And Mike Khouw's GDX Trade,"Carter Worth of Cornerstone Macro spoke on CNBC's Options Action about gold. He said the precious metal bounced off three times from its support at $1,677, forming a triple bottom pattern. Worth has also noticed gold's relative performance to copper has started to improve, making new relative highs. He also expects the U.S. dollar to pull back, which should help gold advance higher, to $1,850. Mike Khouw wants to use options to make a bullish trade in VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Etf (NYSE:GDX). He wants to buy the October $31 call for $1.39 and sell the September $33 call for 30 cents. The total cost of the trade would be $1.09, which sets the breakeven for the trade at $32.09 or 0.78% above the closing price on Friday. If the September $33 call expires out of the money, Khouw can sell another call and lower his cost basis for the October $31 call."

They paid between $2.50 and $2.70 for them which sets the break even for the trade at around 17% above the current stock price. Najarian has also noticed a purchase of 4,000 contracts of the November $33 calls in VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), all in one print.

2022-02-14,"PreMarket Prep Plus: Trading Ideas For Time Of Tension Between Russia, Ukraine","Brent Slava, head of the Benzinga Pro Newsdesk, was spot-on with his topic for Monday’s segment on PreMarket Prep Plus: trading uncertainty amid global geopolitical news.” Nervous Markets: The rising tensions between Russia and the U.S. over a potential ground invasion of Ukraine has added even more uncertainty to an already volatile market. Slava offered several issues for investors to add to their watchlist under these conditions. Potential Armed Conflicts: At this time, it is difficult to anticipate the U.S. response if Russia proceeds with an invasion. No one knows how matters could escalate if this occurs. Therefore, it is important to follow the price action of defense contractors. Slava mentioned General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD), Lockheed Martin Group (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), and L3Harris Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LHX). Cyberattacks: In the event, the potential conflict extends into cyberspace, Slava noted a few issues that may draw investor attention. Three of the more widely followed issue are Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) and CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR). Another issue linked to a potential buyout from Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT), is the former Fireeye Inc., now known as Mandiant Corp (NASDAQ:MNDT). Foreign Markets: Slava mentioned two ETFs. One, the VanExk Russia ETF (BATS: RSX), tracks Russia, and to track the impact on Europe there's the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (NYSE:VGK). Flight To Quality: Recently, gold and silver have shown signs of strength that has not been seen in quite some time as a hedge for inflation. Slava mentioned three ETFs that may have another catalyst to drive prices higher. Those are the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). It should be noted that all three are trading sharply higher as of Monday afternoon."
2022-02-22,Ukraine Crisis Boosts Gold Names: A Gold Name Hits Our System's Top Ten For The First Time Since 2020,"Ukraine Crisis Boosts Gold Miners A few days ago, we posted Russian journalist Anatoly Karlin's assessment that there was an 85% chance of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Subsequently, we posted a follow up noting that a missing piece--a casus belli--had fallen into place. Now, the President of the United States has predicted that Russia will invade Ukraine. The increasing certainty of war breaking out there seems to have finally given a boost to gold names including the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). That was enough for our system, which gauges stock and options market sentiment, to put GDX into its top ten on Friday. Screen capture via Portfolio Armor on 2/18/2022. GDX represents a new theme in our top ten, which this year has often included industrial commodities names such as the iPath Series B Bloomberg Coffee Subindex Total Return ETN (NYSE:JO) and the Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bull 2X Shares ETF (NYSE:GUSH), chip names such as Nvidia, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA), and post-COVID reopenning names such as United Continental Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL). The Possibility Of A False Breakout As Sprott Money suggested on Friday though (Gold Breaks Out To The Upside), there is a possibility this has been a false breakout for GDX: GDX The bullish flag structure that I cited in each of the past 2 weeks has certainly come to fruition. GDX sliced through resistance at its red downtrend line and the 200MA and has broken the prior high of 34.48 back in November. However, it needs to close above 34.48. A drop back down below there would signal a fake breakout which is bearish. In Case We're Wrong About GDX In the event our system is wrong about GDX and this has been a false breakout, below are a couple of ways longs can limit their downside risk over the next several months. Uncapped Upside, Positive Cost As of Friday's close, these were the optimal puts to hedge 1,000 shares of GDX against a greater-than-25% decline by mid-June. This and subsequent screen captures are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app. The cost here was $510, or 1.48% of position value, calculated conservatively, based on the ask price of the puts (in practice you can often buy and sell options at some price between the bid and ask). Capped Upside, Negative Cost If you were willing to cap your possible upside at 30% between now and mid-June, this was the optimal collar to hedge against a >25% drop over the same time frame as of Friday's close. Here the cost was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $80 when opening this collar, assuming, to be conservative, that you placed both trades (buying the puts and selling the calls) at the worst ends of their respective spreads. The Best Hedge Against A Market Drop Although gold and oil names may rally further in the event Russia invades Ukraine, if you're concern is protecting your stock portfolio against a market downturn, the best hedge against that would be to buy optimal puts on index ETFs that correlate closely with your stocks, such as the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSE:SPY)."
2022-03-15,Good As Gold: Investors Haven't Given Up On The Traditional Safe Haven,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is down 11.4% year-to-date in 2022, but one age-old flight-to-safety investments is holding up just fine. The price of gold is up 9.5% so far in 2022. SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 4.6% year-to-date, while the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is up 13.7%. Gold Solves This: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) bulls have had a great run the past couple of years, and many argue that the popular cryptocurrency has replaced gold as the best way to protect your portfolio from downside in the stock market. Unfortunately, market price action so far in 2022 has demonstrated that the price of Bitcoin is highly correlated to other risk assets, including stock prices. In fact, Bitcoin prices are down 26.4% so far in 2022, more than doubling the declines of the S&P 500. Related Link: What Happened To Stock Prices The Last Time Wheat Broke Above $10? A Warning To Investors There are plenty of reasons for investors to be seeking a safe haven for their cash these days, given the Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising interest rates this week, inflation is at a 40-year high and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has disrupted supply chains and raised geopolitical uncertainty. While the invasion rattled the stock market, gold prices have remained remarkably solid in recent weeks since the invasion began. Correlation And Diversification: Diversification is the most powerful tool for any investor to help reduce risk in a portfolio. To maximize diversification, investors need to identify market sectors and assets that have minimal correlation to each other. When you have a portfolio of assets that are highly correlated, a market sell-off will likely drag down your entire portfolio all at once. However, if your assets have a low or even negative correlation, a stock market sell-off or a drop in one single market sector, such as the tech sector or energy sector, might not tank your entire portfolio. Benzinga's Take: Gold has historically had a very low correlation with stock prices, making it a great way to protect your portfolio from a stock market sell-off. For investors looking for an effective inflation hedge that can hold up amid a broad stock market sell-off, gold may still be the best option in today's market."
2022-04-14,"If You're Not Buying Gold, Consider These Five Gold Stocks","Investors already know that gold is a very interesting market when the tide gets tough. As they turn to derivatives such as futures and CFDs, buying shares of companies in the sector is an option worth weighing. In times of recession or economic crisis, investors tend to take money out of the stock market and take refuge in safe-haven assets such as the precious metal. During the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the price reached an all-time high of over $2,000 per ounce in August 2020, surpassing its previous record from 2011. Here are some gold stocks that are also very attractive, ones that could yield more earnings than investing in gold itself, according to a MarketBeat report. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) The Canadian giant expects to produce nearly 4.5 million ounces every year through 2030. After recently thrashing earnings expectations and setting a $1 billion stock buyback, Barrick raised its dividend from 9 to 10 cents. The company’s net earnings hit $726 million —41 cents a share— from $685 million or —39 cents— year-on-year. Revenue jumped about 1% to $3.31 billion, beating estimates for $3.2 billion. CEO John Thornton said, “After careful consideration of our capital allocation, the Board has settled on a new dividend policy of a base dividend with an additional performance dividend linked to the net cash on the balance sheet starting in 2022.” VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) An ETF is one of the best ways to diversify at fewer costs, among them the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF. It offers access to some of the juiciest gold stocks in the market with less than $45 a share as of March 29, 2022. VanEck’s ETF holds positions in the likes of Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold, Franco Nevada Corp (TSE:FNV), Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM), and Gold Fields Limited (JSE:GFI). With an expense ratio of 0.5%, the ETF recovered from a low of $29 to $40, and estimates are pinning much hope on $45 by the end of the year. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) One of the biggest gold companies in the business, Newmont’s dividend yield hit 2.82% declaring $0.55 per share of common stock for the fourth quarter of 2021 —payable on March 24 this year. The firm also smashed earnings estimates with Q4 2021 EPS of 78 cents, and revenue coming in at $3.39 billion surpassing expectations by $13.58 million. Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina also raised the firm’s target on NEM from $67 to $72, while Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) also raised its price target from $70 to $75 with a “buy” rating. B2Gold Corp (TSE:BTO) The gold producer operates three big mines, Mali, Namibia, and the Philippines, and has a dividend yield of 3.5%. Last year, the company produced almost one million ounces of gold at an all-in cost of $888 —one of the industry’s lowest, which makes it an attractive option. In 2022, the company is expected to produce between 990,000 to 1.05 million ounces at an all-in cost of production ranging from $1,010 and $1,050 an ounce. This year’s Q1 earnings report said that the Company's total gold production for 2021 was an annual record of 1,047,414 ounces, near the upper-end of its revised guidance range of between 1,015,000 – 1,055,000 ounces, and exceeding the upper end of its original guidance range. Gold Fields Limited (JSE:GFI) Gold Fields Limited has resources in several regions such as South Africa, Ghana, West Africa, Australia, and Peru. The company has an annual gold production of 2.2 million ounces, attributable gold-equivalent mineral reserves of 52.1 Moz, and mineral resources of 116 Moz, according to its website. Last year, dividend yield hit 2.7% and revenue grew by about 8% to $4.2 billion from $3.9 billion. It also saw net income of $789 million —a 9% increase year-on-year. Further, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) analysts raised the price target from $13.80 to $15.50 and slapped an “overweight” rating on the company. Also, according to Tip Ranks, RBC Capital has a buy rating on the stock, with a target of $12."
2022-04-18,This Gold ETF Is Breaking Out,"If inflation continues to be a problem, the price of gold should move higher. And if it does, shares of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) could skyrocket. When a stock or ETF trades at a higher price than where it had previously hit resistance, traders call it a breakout. This can be a bullish dynamic. Resistance is a large concentration of sellers who are trying to sell their shares at, or close to, the same price. When stocks reach resistance levels, they tend to stop going higher. As you can see on the following chart, this is what happened when GDX reached $39.75 last May. Now GDX is trading above this important level; The resistance has broken. This means the sellers who created it have finished or canceled their orders. With this supply off of the market, buyers will be forced to pay higher prices to bring sellers back off the sidelines. This forces shares into a new uptrend and that could be the case here.

2022-06-27,Here's What To Watch On Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 2X Shares (NUGT),"Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:NUGT) was trading down about 2% on Monday in continued consolidation after plunging over 6% lower on Thursday. The gold miners sector recently enjoyed a long bull-cycle, which lasted from Jan. 28 to April 18 of this year and caused NUGT to soar 102% higher during that timeframe. Since late April, NUGT has erased all of its gains, however, plunging 54% from its 52-week high of $82.86. NUGT is a double leveraged fund that is designed to outperform the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. The ETF tracks a number of gold and silver mining companies through its four holdings, with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and the U.S. Dollar making up 91.27% of its weighted holdings. The other two funds making up the remainder of NUGT’s weightings are Goldman Sachs Trust Financial Square Treasury Instruments Fund Institutional, weighted at 8.49% and Dreyfus Government Cash Management Funds Institutional, with a 0.23% weighting. It should be noted that leveraged ETFs are meant to be used as a trading vehicle as opposed to a long-term investment by experienced traders. Leveraged ETF’s should never be used by an investor with a buy and hold strategy or those who have low risk appetites. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The NUGT Chart: On Friday and Monday, NUGT was trading sideways within Thursday’s trading range, which has settled the ETF into a double inside bar pattern on the daily chart. The pattern leans bearish in this case because NUGT was trading low before forming the pattern, but traders can watch for a break up or down from Thursday’s mother bar on higher-than-average volume to gauge future direction. NUGT is also trading in a confirmed downtrend, with the most recent lower high printed on June 16 at $44.24 and the most recent lower low formed at the $37.68 mark on Thursday. If NUGT breaks bearishly from the inside bar pattern, the downtrend will continue, but if the ETF breaks bullishly from the formation, the downtrend will be negated and a reversal to the upside could be in the cards. A bounce to the upside is likely to come over the next few trading days because NUGT has developed bullish divergence on the daily chart. Bullish divergence occurs when a stock makes a series of lower lows but its relative strength index (RSI) makes a series of higher lows. For the divergence to correct, NUGT will either need to trade higher or plummet low enough to drop the RSI below 30%. For traders looking to play a leveraged gold miners ETF bear, Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:DUST) is an option. NUGT has resistance above at $41.31 and $44.32 and support below at $37.68 and $33. See Also: Best Gold Stocks Right Now • Updated Daily"
2022-07-07,BZ Chart Of The Day: Is It Finally Time To Buy Gold?,"Gold is oversold and at support. That means it may be time to buy the commodity. The downtrend that started in March may be over. The term oversold refers to a security’s momentum. This is a measure of how far it has moved in a given time. If it gets sold aggressively and pushed below its typical range, traders say it’s oversold. This is important because markets that are oversold tend to reverse and rebound. Support is a large concentration of investors who are looking to buy close to the same price. There is so much demand at support levels that when selloffs reach them, they tend to pause or even end. As you can see on the following chart, gold may have found support again around the $1,725 per ounce level. It’s also oversold. The stage may be set for a move higher.

2022-07-22,Is Gold About To Turn Bullish? A Look At Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull (NUGT),"Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:NUGT) shot up over 6% higher after the market opened, but the move higher was hampered by the general market, which saw the S&P 500 falling about 0.7%. The gold miners sector recently enjoyed a long bull-cycle, which lasted from Jan. 28 to April 18 of this year and caused NUGT to soar 102% higher during that timeframe. Since late April, NUGT has erased all of its gains, however, plunging 63% from its 52-week high of $82.86.

The NUGT Chart: Despite falling to trade mostly flat intraday on Friday, when NUGT reached its high-of-day, the ETF confirmed it's now trading in an uptrend by printing a higher high above the July 18 high of $31.52. On July 20, NUGT printed a higher low above the July 14 52-week low of $28.13, which negated the downtrend. NUGT is trading in a rising channel pattern between two parallel trendlines. The pattern is considered to be bullish unless the ETF breaks down from the lower ascending trendline on higher-than-average volume. Unfortunately, the rising channel paired with the steep downtrend that occurred between June 3 and July 14 may have settled NUGT into a bear flag pattern. If the bear flag pattern is recognized, traders may choose to take a position in the leveraged gold miners ETF bear, Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:DUST). NUGT is trading below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, both of which are bearish indicators. The ETF is also trading under the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, which indicates gold is currently in a bear market. NUGT has resistance above at $33 and $37.68 and support below at $28.13 and $24.15. See Also: Eliminating Buy And Hold Myths"
2022-08-09,Gold Seeing Bullish Momentum,"On the daily price chart, it’s clear that gold topped out in March at $192 — using the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) as a proxy for gold price — and that a low of $158 came on July 21. Since then, the metal is seeing bullish momentum as it lifts up off of the lows and blasts it way back up to the $167 level before a bit of selling came in early August. The downtrend line that connects the March peak with the April high was hit last week at $167. Enough selling at this line caused a halt in the bounce into August from the July low. A close or two above that red-dotted downtrend line — maybe this week— would confirm that bullish momentum is being seen. Take a look at the weekly chart for gold: What’s revealing about looking at the weekly price chart is the way the metal clearly tested support and then bounced upward. The support line connecting the May/June 2020 lows with the March/April 2021 lows is clear. Gold tested it last week and then found buyers. It will be key for the price to remain above that line for any kind of bullish momentum to continue. So far, so good. For the record, here’s how it looks on the monthly chart: The red-dotted line that connects the late 2008 low down near 70 with the late 2015 low and then the mid-to-late 2018 low – it’s an uptrend. From this long-term viewpoint, the price of gold has been steadily bullish for years despite occasional ups and downs. Here’s an old-school point and figure chart: The benefit of viewing this type of chart is how clearly it shows the $158 level must hold for bullish gains to continue. A break below that key price support area would be a problem for those holding gold. Gold stocks followed along with the benchmark VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), peaking in early April at just above $41 and then descending along with the price of the metal to a low of $24.4 in late July. This gold stock chart is now showing a few positive divergences among basic price indicators: Note that the downtrend line that connected the April peak with the June high has been crossed on the upside by late July. The more bullish look has continued into the month of August. Also, those positive divergences are now showing up on the relative strength indicator (RSI) and the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), both seen below the price chart. It’s not guaranteed that gold price action and gold stock action will continue to look better. The most recent non-farm payrolls report will have an effect on interest rates and on general market action. Precious metals investors will want to keep a close eye on the price movement for the rest of August – but the last week or two may hold promise. Looking for ways to boost your returns?

2022-08-15,"Analyst Cuts Price Targets For These Gold Stocks, Names Agnico Eagle Top Pick","Second-quarter earnings season was mostly bad news for North American precious metal miners. Several producers lowered their guidance for the second half of the year, and Bank of America analyst Lawson Winder lowered his price target for a handful of gold and silver miners on Monday. Updated Targets: Winder made the following changes to gold and silver stocks under his coverage: Centerra Gold Inc. (NYSE:CGAU), reiterated Underperform rating, price target cut from $6.30 to $5.60. Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE:PAAS), reiterated Buy rating, price target cut from $25 to $22. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), reiterated Buy rating, price target cut from $27.25 to $27. Related Link: An ETF To Protect Your Portfolio? Goldman Sachs Has a Product For You Bank of America projects gold prices will average $1,938 per ounce in 2022 and $2,049/oz in 2023. The firm is projecting silver prices of $21.04/oz in 2022 and $19.51/oz in 2022. Winder said stagflation could push gold and prices even higher than his current projections. Top Pick: He named Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM) his top stock pick in the precious metal mining group. AEM is a stand-out with unchanged 2022 production and cost guidance (unlike many peers), is delivering well on Kirkland Lake merger synergies, and a focus on increasing reserve life by way of exploration, Winder said.

Benzinga's Take: Gold certainly hasn't been the classic inflation hedge investors have been looking for in 2022. In fact, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) has even underperformed the S&P 500 as a whole year-to-date, falling 16.6%."

The company has “underappreciated exploration value” following its merger with Kirkland Lake Gold earlier this year, according to the analyst. The Agnico Analyst: Emily Chieng initiated coverage of Agnico with a Buy rating and a price target of CA$72 ($55.45). The new price target suggests 24% upside for the stock. The Agnico Thesis: The company added three mines to its portfolio through its recent merger: the Macassa, Detour Lake and Fosterville mines, which give Agnico “significant synergies,” Chieng said in the note. “The company has targeted $0.9 billion of synergies over the coming five years, and a total of $2 billion of synergies over the coming 10 years,” the analyst said. “While corporate synergies are already approaching the top end of the company’s own expectations, we believe there exists upside to operational synergy (sharing of infrastructure, procurement and warehousing efficiencies, operational improvements) and strategic opportunities,” she added. Chieng sees further upside based on Agnico’s potential for production growth from the company’s “largest ever exploration budget,” which it launched over the past two years. In addition to Agnico’s exploration at properties formerly solely owned by Kirkland Lake, its deposits at the Odyssey Project, Hope Bay and Upper Beaver offer “significant exploration potential,” the analyst said. The analyst also believes Agnico’s “multiple contraction is overdone” and that it “may have reflected uncertainty around the company’s production growth potential following the merger.” Although Chieng expects Agnico’s annual growth rate to slow because of the merger, she sees “the company’s strong track record for exploration and development success as reflective of upside potential.” See Also: Best Gold Stocks Right Now • Updated Daily The Market Landscape: In late 2021, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s tone turned drastically more hawkish when it decided to double its taper of monthly bond purchases on Dec. 15. This year, in an attempt to fight soaring inflation, the Fed implemented a series of rate hikes, with a March raise of 0.5%. In June and July, the Fed doubled down on its policy and issued two 0.75% hikes back-to-back. Despite consumer price index (CPI) data for the month of July showing inflation may have peaked, Powell’s comments at the Jackson Hole Symposium last month indicated the Fed may not be ready to slow its policy, and that another 0.75% rate hike could be on the table when it meets on Sept. 15 and 16. The Fed, traders and investors will be watching for CPI data for the month of August to be released on Tuesday morning. When compared to the data for the month of July, it should become more apparent whether inflation has continued to decrease or whether July’s numbers were a blip. The information will guide the Fed’s policy decision later this week but the market will likely begin to price in the expectation of the percentage at which the Fed will raise its benchmark rate when the market opens Tuesday. The Gold Outlook: Spot gold has held up stronger than gold equities historically, but the last big bull run in gold and gold-related stocks, which took place during the first quarter, set the entire sector soaring with equities enjoying a slightly longer surge. Since then, spot gold and gold equities have been trading in fairly consistent downtrends on larger time frames (the weekly and monthly charts). On the daily chart, however, both spot gold and GDX began trading in uptrends on Sept. 1, which may indicate larger reversals to the upside are on the horizon. The Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin negated its daily downtrend on Sept. 9 and on Monday the crypto regained the 50-day simple moving average as support, which may indicate longer-term sentiment is turning bullish.

2022-09-26,How The FOMC Announcement Affected Precious Metal Prices,"Precious metals stocks and precious metals reacted positively to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s announcement that interest rates will by 0.75%. Because this sector is traditionally considered an inflation hedge — although not so much lately — the slightly upward move may be a little surprising. Taking rates higher is designed to stop inflationary trends. The daily price chart of the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) looked like this at the close Wednesday: The bullish engulfing candlestick — where the price goes lower than the previous day and then closes higher — is said to be a good sign. The relative strength indicator (RSI) and the moving average convergence/divergence indicator (MACD) in below the price chart are forming positive divergences to price. SPDR Gold shares closed up 0.46%. iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) closed up 1.86%, outperforming gold and with improved trading volume. Although it’s probably early to say that the price of silver has bottomed, it’s clear that both the RSI and the MACD are showing positive divergences to recent price lows — a good sign, according to standard technical analysis. The VanEck Sector Gold Miners Exchange Traded Fund (NYSE:GDX), a diversified collection of gold stocks, closed higher by 0.34% Wednesday. While it’s not much higher, it’s not down after Powell’s anti-inflationary rate hike remarks. Although the MACD indicator suggests the potential for a bottom, the RSI is not quite there yet to confirm it. Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM) is the largest precious metals operation traded on the New York Stock Exchange and closely followed as a bellwether for the sector. The stock closed lower by 0.93% Wednesday, tamping down whatever bullishness might have been evident in the sector. Note that Newmont managed to remain above the late August/early September lows and that both the RSI and MACD indicators are in positive divergence mode. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) is the other large mining company widely followed by the precious metals crowd. Barrick closed higher by 0.86%, a different kind of look than Newmont’s close after Powell’s announcements. This precious metals stock has a chart showing positive divergences on both the relative strength indicator and with the moving average convergence/divergence indicator. October’s consumer price index and producer price index readings might be the next catalyst for this sector. Expectations about those inflation readings will affect gold and silver stocks until then.

2022-12-05,"2023 Predictions From Standard Chartered: Bitcoin $5,000, Gold Soars, And Trouble For Biden","According to Standard Chartered analysts, the present crypto winter might grow even colder. Eric Robertsen, the bank's Global Head of Research, forecasted numerous possibilities for 2023, including Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency, falling to as low as $5,000 next year, along with the impeachment of President Joe Biden, among other unexpected shocks. The forecasts are part of Standard Chartered's annual list of surprises that experts feel markets are ignoring or under-pricing. Robertsen expects yields to fall along with tech stocks. “Yields plunge along with technology shares, and while the Bitcoin sell-off decelerates, the damage has been done,” Robertsen wrote in a note to investors Sunday. According to the analyst, a drop in tech stocks in 2023 might result in a wave of bankruptcies, similar to the wave of crypto firms that defaulted following the collapse of Three Arrows Capital this year, including FTX. Read also: Struggling Cryptocurrency Lender Genesis Owes Debtors $1.8B “Perhaps echoing the contraction in the digital assets sector, next-generation technology companies see a surge in bankruptcies in 2023,” the analysts wrote in the note. The annual list is now in its eighth edition, however it should be emphasized that it is not designed to foresee events with a high probability, but rather to analyze circumstances with a non-zero chance of happening that are not yet part of market consensus. Robertsen also stated that in the surprise situation of crypto crashing, he sees gold skyrocketing - he believes the precious metal can reach $2,250 per ounce (currently $1,778.20). This may also be bullish for the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), and gold miners like Newmont Corp (NYSE:NEM) and Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD).

2023-03-17,"Gold Rallies Eyeing $2,000/oz As Recession Looms – These 3 ETFs To Gain From Precious Metal's Bull Wave","Gold has had a textbook rally following the tumultuous week in the U.S. banking sector and heavy drops in Fed hike expectations as recession risks loom. On Friday, gold surged 2% beyond $1,950/oz levels, putting it on track for a 6% weekly gain, its largest since early November 2022. The precious metal is regarded as the premier safe haven asset in this current market climate since it does not carry any default concerns, has continuously maintained its value through periods of persistent inflation, and generally climbs during times of economic slowdown and recession. Next: 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' Author Says You Should Invest In These Two Assets Amid Silicon Valley Bank's Collapse Gold is very sensitive to rate movements because higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of investing in non-yielding assets like gold, and vice versa. A weaker dollar, lower Treasury yields, and a collapse in expectations for the Fed's rate hikes are all contributing to gold's bullish momentum. Fed swaps now price in a 19 basis point hike in March, with the terminal rate forecast to reach 4.9% in May and then fall from there. Overall, there are three 25-basis-point rate cuts priced until December 2023. Short-term two-year Treasury yields fell by more than 40 basis points this week, the largest drop since October 1987's Black Monday. Gold technical analysis: Bull flag pattern in place Gold price daily timeframe – Chart: TradingView Gold prices broke through a multi-resistance zone this week, which included the 50-day moving average, the psychological $1,900/oz level, and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the high-to-low range from 2022. After the breakout of the flag channel, we can observe the emergence of a bullish flag pattern on the price chart, which may presage an extension of the current rally. The next resistance level is between 1,975 and 1,980, which corresponds to the 2023 price high as well as the 78.6% Fibonacci level. Breaking through this barrier will boost the bull's momentum and improve the chances of an assault on the psychological 2,000 mark. 3 Gold ETFs to Watch: GLD, GDX, GDXJ SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and Junior Gold Miners VanEck Vectors ETF (NYSE:GDX) GDXJ are three ETFs to watch for investors looking to profit on gold's rally. 1) GLD SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) is an exchange-traded fund managed by World Gold Trust Services, LLC that invests in gold bullions and is linked to physical gold performance. As a result, its price moves in lockstep with the commodity, and it does not pay dividends. GLD saw its highest weekly net inflow in almost a year in the week ended March 16, totalling $709.5 million. GLD price chart and weekly ETF flows – Chart: Koyfin 2) GDX The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in the stocks of companies in the gold mining industry. It tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index's performance through a complete replication. Dividends are paid once a year, and the current dividend yield is 1.6%. GDX's major holdings include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:EAM). In the week ending March 16, GDX received $52 million in weekly net inflows, after around $240 million in outflows the previous week. GDX price chart and weekly ETF flows – Chart: Koyfin 3) GDXJ The VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE:GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in stocks of companies involved in the gold mining industry. Differently from GDX, the majority of these companies are still in the development and exploratory phases and are seeking for land with a high potential for significant mineral deposits. Junior gold miners are thus more volatile than already productive gold miners, which is why GDXJ has a greater volatility than GDX. GDXJ's top holdings include Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC), Yamana Gold Inc. (NYSE:AUY), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI), and Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE:PAAS). The last week's ETF flow data is missing, but GDXJ had $24 million in outflows in the week ending March 9.

2023-04-05,Digging For Discounts: Gold Mining Stocks Offer 30% Bargain—Is It An Unmissable Buying Opportunity?,"Gold mining companies have returned to the forefront of the market as gold prices break decisively above $2,000 per troy ounce and are projected to approach their all-time highs. Investors ponder if gold mining businesses have already capitalized from the recent gains in the price of the precious metal, or whether they are instead selling at a discount. By plotting the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) in relation to the price of gold, it seems that gold miners are trading relatively cheap with respect to what the bullion prices would suggest. Assuming a perfect or nearly perfect correlation with gold prices, as it has been for much of the past decade, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF would have traded about 30% higher than current levels. When gold prices surged above $2,000/oz last year in March 2022 and in August 2020, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF traded above $40 per share, or at least 25% higher than today's price. Why Are Gold Miners So Cheap To Gold? The reason why gold miners performed somewhat poorly in comparison to commodity prices was because the industry's major players—Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corp. (NYSE:FNV), and Agnico Eagles Mines Ltd. (NYSE:AEM)—rose far less than other smaller names in the industry. Stocks with less than 1% weight in the GDX portfolio, such as Equinox Gold Corp. (NYSEAM:EQX), up 70%, Dundee Precious Metals Ltd. (OTCPK: DPMLF), up 58%, and Torex Gold Resources (OTCPK: TORXF), up 45%, have produced the biggest year-to-date gains in the gold mining industry. In essence, if the bottom of the sector has soared in response to gold increases, the heavyweights have yet to jump on gold's bullish bandwagon. GDX Best-Performing Holdings Year-to-Date Company Weight (%) YTD Return (%) Equinox Gold Corp. 0.69 69.82 Dundee Precious Metals Inc. 0.58 58.31 Torex Gold Resources Inc. 0.58 45.02 GDX Top Holdings and Their Performance Year-to-Date Company Weight (%) YTD Return (%) Newmont Corporation 10.40 10.59 Barrick Gold Corporation 8.82 15.21 Franco-Nevada Corporation 7.57 13.03 Agnico Eagle Mines Limited 7.25 8.12 Newmont Corp: Analyst Price Targets Might Be Raised Shortly The present median analyst price target for Newmont stands at $56.00, a relatively conservative figure when considering the implications of current gold prices. Wall Street analysts have traditionally adjusted Newmont's price target with some lag compared to gold price fluctuations. Should gold prices continue to sustain at current levels or even increase, it's reasonable to anticipate upward revisions for Newmont's and other gold mining giants' price targets in the coming weeks or months. This trend could potentially yield a positive impact on mining stock prices. Read next: Peter Schiff Once Asked Bitcoin 'Fanatics' To Stop Making Fun Of Gold: 'Don't Be The Last One Onboard'"
2023-04-13,VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Skyrockets To 11-Month Highs: A Stunning 25% YTD Surge As Precious Metals Dazzle,"The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), an exchange traded fund that invests in equities of firms operating in the metals and mining, gold, and silver sectors, has risen to levels last seen in early May 2022, driven by big gains in precious metals commodities. After rising more than 25% in 2023, gold miners are currently the best-performing industry year-to-date, surpassing the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH). Backed by fundamentals: Gold prices surged to $2,040/oz on Thursday, approaching fresh 2023 highs as falling producer inflation and increasing jobless claims fueled market speculation about the Fed's rate hiking cycle nearing an end. Gold prices have risen 12% so far in 2023. Silver also rallied to $25.83/oz, a price last seen a year ago, and has risen nearly 25% in the past month alone. Five Gold Miners To Watch: The strongest contributors in the previous month to the GDX's performance were Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) up 53%, Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. (NYSE:AEM) up 24.3%, AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (NYSE:AU) up 47%, Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) up 18%, and Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM) up 13%. Read also: 5 Stocks To Watch After Thursday's Inflation, Jobless Data: Why Netflix, 2 Gold Miners Are Moving GDX Still Undervalued Compared To Gold Prices Gold miners, as represented by the VanEck GDX ETF, are catching up to gold, but remain undervalued in comparison to current bullion prices. As the figure below indicates, historically, there has been an almost perfect link between gold prices and the GDX, which somehow weakened last year.

2023-07-03,Gold Miners Trading At Bargain Price To Gold: Is GDX The Buy Opportunity For The Remainder Of 2023?,"Gold prices, as tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), closed the first half of 2023 with a shy performance of 5%, significantly underperforming the equity asset class, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) up by 16% and with the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) up by a staggering 38%. But while prices of the precious metal are only 7% off their all-time highs, steep price discounts are clearly visible among gold mining stocks. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is trading one-third lower than its highs in 2020 and 54% lower than its all-time highs in 2011, attracting the attention of value hunters. By simply correlating the price of gold (GLD) to that of the Gold Miners ETF (GDX), the latter should be trading at least 30% higher than current levels when looking at a 5-year timeframe. Does this present a buy opportunity for investors to enter an undervalued sector before its recovery, or is it a potential value trap waiting to unfold? North American Gold Miners Offer Attractive Valuations When analyzing the U.S.-listed large-cap gold miners included in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF, they stood out with highly appealing valuations according to common stock metrics, including price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, price-to-book (P/B) ratios, and price-to-median analyst price target spreads. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), one of the largest gold producers globally and is headquartered in Colorado, trades at 15 times its projected 12-month earnings, showing one of the lowest forward P/E ratio of its history. Compared to the median analyst price target ($59), NEM currently trades at $43.1 per share, effectively implying a 38% discount. Another industry giant with a similar forward P/E to Newmont is Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD), which is trading at a 30% discount to the median analyst price target. Barrick Gold also screens price-to-book value of 1.3x, which is one of the lowest for the North American market. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM), a Canadian-diversified gold mining company operating across Canada, Finland, and Mexico, is trading at a 22x forward P/E ratio, well below its 5-year average of 38.9x. When looking at the median analyst price target ($65), AEM current market prices ($50) imply a 30% discount.

2023-07-13,Cash In On The Crashing Dollar: 5 Stocks And ETFs Ready To Soar From The Greenback's Downfall,"The U.S. dollar index (DXY), as tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), dropped below the key 100 mark on Thursday, plunging to its weakest levels since April 2022, as softer-than-expected consumer and producer inflation encouraged traders to scale back bets of more than one rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year. Consumer price inflation fell to 3% year on year in June, the slowest rate since March 2021, a full percentage point lower than in May and well below the predicted 3.1%. In June, producer inflation fell to a negligible 0.1% year-on-year, the lowest reading since August 2020 and considerably below the predicted 0.4%. The dollar came under pressure following a steep decline in U.S. Treasury yields, with the policy-sensitive two-year Note yield falling 20 basis points to 4.66% in the previous two sessions. The value of the dollar, as gauged by the DXY index, has dropped 4% since the beginning of the year and 13% from its all-time high reached in September 2022. The dollar has suffered even greater losses versus emerging-market currencies, such as the Mexican peso (MXN) and the Chilean peso (CLP), which are up 20% and 18%, respectively, since their lows in 2022. Chart: US Dollar Index Falls To 15-Month Lows Dollar Weakens: What Are The Effects? For U.S. exporters: Products made in the U.S. become more competitive on international markets when the dollar weakens. As a result, American exporters may see an increase in demand and sales, potentially improving their profits. For multinational corporations: Multinational corporations headquartered in the U.S. typically get a sizable amount of their revenue from outside of the country. A weaker dollar can improve the value of these earnings when they are repatriated (converted back to U.S. currency). For emerging markets: A weaker dollar might make it less expensive for emerging-market countries to repay or service their debt in U.S. dollars, which makes a high portion of their overall debt. It also encourages investors to seek higher returns in emerging markets, leading to increased capital inflows and potentially boosting these economies. For inflation and purchasing power: It’s important to note that a weaker dollar can have also downsides, such as potential inflationary pressures and decreased purchasing power for U.S. consumers and companies importing foreign goods.

(NYSE:XOM): Exxon is the largest oil company in U.S. Because oil is traded in U.S. dollars on international markets, a weakening dollar makes oil barrels more affordable to buyers. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM): Newmont is a major gold miner whose business is heavily reliant on precious metals performance. A weakening dollar makes gold more appealing, driving up the price of the metal. 5 ETFs Set To Rally From A Falling Dollar Pacer US Export Leaders ETF (NYSE:PEXL): PEXL offers exposure to U.S. companies that rank within the top 10% in the country in terms of foreign sales, providing a unique focus on firms benefiting from a strong international presence.

2023-07-24,Unlocking Gold Mining's Supercycle: Insights From Benzinga's Virtual Conference,"In the latest virtual conference presented by Benzinga, three outstanding experts and industry professionals gathered to explore the prospects of a new “Supercycle” for gold miners. Delving into crucial factors affecting the performance of gold mining stocks, they discussed Fed interest rates, market valuations, geopolitics, ESG and technological innovation in the industry. In the first part, Imaru Casanova, a portfolio manager for Gold and Precious Metals at VanEck, highlighted the potential bullish catalysts for gold miners and presented her top stock recommendations. Taylor McKenna, CFA and an analyst at Kopernik Global Investors, emphasized the value of gold mining stocks and discussed the application of AI technologies. Luke Norman, co-founder and executive chairman at US Gold Corp. (NYSE:USAU), offered insights into the gold mining exploration side and the permitting cycle. VanEck Sees Attractive Valuations In The Gold Mining Industry VanEck’s Casanova expressed optimism about the outlook for gold miners, citing the end of the Fed tightening cycle as a potential bullish catalyst. With strong global support in the current environment, gold miners are poised to demonstrate their leverage with higher gold prices. Casanova highlighted the historically low multiples at which gold mining stocks are currently trading, coupled with controlled balance sheet costs, generate an attractive investment opportunity. “When gold traded at these levels (around $1,970) in the past, stocks in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) or VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) index were trading 15-20% higher,” Casanova said. Regarding top stock recommendations, Casanova identified Endeavor Mining PLC (OTCPK: EDVMF), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI), and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM). She emphasized that VanEck’s current price forecast for gold is $2,075 per ounce in the next 12 months, which offers a compelling case for diversification and growth in the gold mining sector. Read Also: Agnico Eagle Mines’ Debt Overview Kopernik Global Investors Is Bullish On Smaller Miners Kopernik Global Investors’ McKenna expressed strong conviction in gold mining, pointing out the attractive valuations the sector offers. McKenna discussed the opportunity in smaller companies within the industry such as Seabridge Gold Inc. (NYSE:SA), International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. (NYSE:THM), and Western Copper and Gold Corp. (NYSE:WRN), which trade at even cheaper valuations than big miners but carry higher risk. Among the majors he highlighted is Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) offers attractive valuations as it shows an all-in-sustaining cost (AISC) of $1,400 an ounce, positioning the company for significant potential if gold prices continue to rise. McKenna also stressed the importance of scrutinizing management teams and incentives, and he shared insights into how AI technologies, such as driverless trucks for mining, are being employed to boost productivity and reduce environmental impact. US Gold Corp’s Vision for the Greenest Mine in North America US Gold Corp.’s Norman shed light on the gold mining exploration and permitting cycle. He emphasized that smaller companies involved in gold exploration often become investment vehicles for larger corporations in the sector. Norman provided an overview of US Gold Corp.’s primary project, the CK Gold project, and its location just outside Cheyenne, Wyoming. “Navigating the permitting process in North America can be challenging, with federal agencies causing bottlenecks,” Norman said. Norman did highlight the advantage of working with the state of Wyoming, which has set a mandate for a more streamlined permitting timeline. Despite trading at a significant market discount due to perceived permitting challenges, US Gold Corp. has 1.5 million ounces of reserves in the ground, and its all-in-sustaining costs are projected at $800 per ounce. Norman believed the in-situ value of reserves in the ground should place U.S. Gold Corp’s market cap to about $300 million, while the company is currently trading at about $40 million market cap. Norman highlighted how ESG became a hugely important factor in the business and he aspired to develop the greenest mine in North America.

2023-08-30,Forget Stocks And Bonds - Here's Why Gold Is The Best Investment Right Now,"You might think bonds or T-bills look intriguing right now, with some offering nearly 5% back guaranteed. Or maybe you’ve been looking at Walt Disney Co’s (NYSE:DIS) stock, down 25% in the last year. But, according to DataTrek co-founder Nick Colas, it's time to bypass bonds and struggling stocks; gold is the investment to focus on. Colas points out that despite the fact that gold has underperformed the S&P 500 in the United States, it has held up better than most global stocks and equities. Colas also points out that demand for gold comes from different sources, including central banks wanting to bolster their balance sheets. Also Read: Is Cathie Wood The Next Warren Buffett? Apple, Tesla Define Their Investment Strategies Colas argues that because of an increase in demand for gold from central banks throughout the world, gold prices should steadily increase. Colas says that any increase in global geopolitical tensions could help push gold prices even higher. “Now, if you think we're going to have an outbreak of global peace, then gold is probably not a great trade, because central banks will see much less interest and not want to own as much gold,” Colas said in a recent YouTube video and blog post. “However, the current situation feels quite different. We have geopolitical tensions with Russia, with China. Turkey has its own issues.” How To Trade Gold: If you want to go long gold but don’t want to go out and buy physical gold, there are plenty of ETFs and other funds available on U.S. markets that provide solid gold exposure. Here are five gold ETFs that could be good options for longing the precious metal: SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM) iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF (BATS:AAAU) Now Read: Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF Ruling Shifts Sands Of Crypto Regulation: 3 Analysts Weigh In Photo: Shutterstock"
2023-08-31,"Industry ETFs In The Spotlight: August's Winners And Losers Revealed: Where Is Gold, Energy And Biotech?","The major U.S. stock indices, closely monitored through ETFs — the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA), Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) — are all poised to finish the month with negative results. This will mark the first month of losses after a consecutive 5-month winning streak for both the SPY and the QQQ. However, it’s worth considering which industries have fared better or worse in the stock market throughout August 2023. Top-Performing Industry ETFs In August 2023 The list isn’t extensive, and the winners for August don’t boast astonishing performance, underscoring the prevailing downward market trend this month. Among the industry ETFs that have still managed to achieve positive performance during this challenging month, we can identify: SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration and Production (NYSE:XOP) – Monthly performance (Aug): +3.7% – Year-to-date performance: +15.6% – Best performing stock (Aug): Texas Pacific Land Corp.

2023-09-07,"Three Ways I Use RSI To Analyze Trends, And Why Alphabet Is Still In A Clear Bullish Phase","Novice investors usually go on a “Holy Grail quest” early on, reading books and watching videos and searching for that elusive one indicator to rule them all. After 23 years of analyzing the markets using technical analysis, I will tell you one thing for sure… There is no Holy Grail. What I will also tell you is that there are a number of technical indicators that do a very good job of helping the astute investor to analyze trends, quantify investor sentiment, and anticipate inflection points in price. One of my favorite indicators to do all of the above is the Relative Strength Index or RSI. Created by Welles Wilder and promoted in his classic text, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems (featured in our Recommended Reading List!), the RSI has become my go-to oscillator to better understand price dynamics. Today I’ll show three ways that I use the RSI to identify short-term price swings, determine trend phases, and anticipate market turns. Overbought Vs. Oversold Conditions When I was first introduced to technical indicators, I was kindly asked (that is, forced) to prove out the calculations to about 20 indicators in Excel. The idea was that by understanding the math behind each indicator, I could better understand how it was using inputs of price and/or volume and how the output could be used to anticipate turning points. Wilder originally designed RSI for the commodity markets, and for him it was all about mean reversion. In other words, the goal was to buy low and sell high, and RSI was a tool to try and optimize those entry and exit points. The chart of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) has plenty of examples of where overbought conditions were followed by short-term drops, and oversold conditions usually happen right before a bounce higher. To be clear, the real signal is not when the indicator enters the overbought/oversold region, but rather where it exits that extreme condition. Buy signals in February, May, and August 2023 all worked quite well, as gold stocks bounced higher in each instance. Sell signals in January and April 2023 also worked out, with price pulling back in both cases. Sometimes, those extreme readings become a little more complex, and we need to add divergences to our technical analysis arsenal. The Dreaded Bearish Divergence It makes sense that when a stock is an uptrend, the RSI will tend to get to the overbought region. Price is going higher, driven by stronger upside momentum, so an overbought condition should be expected. So when the price continues higher not on stronger momentum but weaker momentum, that’s when we may need to take action. Notice how Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made higher highs every month from January to July? Now focus on the highs in late June and mid-July. The price of AAPL continued to grind higher, but the RSI actually sloped lower. This pattern of higher prices and lower momentum is called a bearish momentum divergence and usually indicates a bullish phase that is “running out of gas”. In other words, the end of the trend is near! We noticed bearish divergences on key growth stocks back in July, which meant the subsequent drop in August was a likely next step for the markets. But how can we relate short-term RSI signals to long-term trends? This is where Connie Brown’s work completely changed how I use the Relative Strength Index. Using RSI to Determine Trend Phases The earlier example using gold stocks provided a decent illustration of overbought and oversold conditions. But sometimes the RSI never gets to an extreme reading. Does that mean the indicator is broken? No, it means the price is trending. In Connie Brown’s groundbreaking book, Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional (another book featured in our Recommended Reading List!), she explains how the range shown by the RSI over time can tell you about the overall trend structure. When a chart is in a confirmed downtrend of lower highs and lower lows, the RSI often becomes oversold on the downswings. But the countertrend moves back to the upside usually stall out with an RSI around 60. You’ll see the opposite in an uptrend, where the RSI often becomes overbought on a move higher but rarely breaks below 40 on pullbacks. Here's that same chart of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) but with the phases indicated with a shaded RSI. Through the end of 2022, Alphabet was in a clear downtrend phase. The fact the RSI never really broke above 60 on upswings tells us that while we are seeing some countertrend bounces, the overall trend remains bearish. Note how the pattern changes in January 2023, with the RSI pushing up to 70 on a rally. This was an early indication that something had changed and that the overall downtrend phase was evolving into a new uptrend phase. As long as GOOGL becomes overbought on upswings, and the RSI remains above 40 on pullbacks, the RSI is telling us that the overall trend remains bullish. I’ve found the Relative Strength Index to be an effective way of anticipating turning points, recognizing trend shifts, and confirming market phases. By applying indicators like RSI in a consistent and disciplined manner, an astute investor can use price momentum to better identify entry and exit points in any market environment.

2023-10-05,"An Oversold Gold Miner With Strong Fundamentals--Its Relative Strength Index Is Below 20, And Its Piotroski F-Score Is 8","Paying Attention To Gold Miners On Zero Hedge on Monday, contributing editor “Quoth The Raven” suggested “paying urgent attention to gold miners”: As everybody knows, one of my favorite assets on the board right now for buying is gold miners. They are completely hated and totally undervalued, without even a semblance of pricing in the potential leverage they could gain from a spike in gold prices. Basically, gold, as tracked by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE:GLD), hasn’t done as well as goldbugs might have expected in an inflationary environment, because rising rates have boosted the dollar, and gold miners, as tracked by the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) have lagged gold. But if you believe the Fed will have to start cutting rates at some point next year, presumably, gold will go up. And when that happens, gold miners will likely go up even more, thanks to their operational leverage, which can turn a double digit increase in the price of gold into a triple digit increase in gold miners’ profits. An Oversold Gold Miner In a recent post, we looked at the power of the technical indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index). A technical indicator to keep in mind for earnings trades. https://t.co/g6zISKkVmc$BIG $SFIX — Portfolio Armor (@PortfolioArmor) September 25, 2023 RSI is a number from 0 to 100 indicating how overbought or oversold a security is. Values over 70 are usually considered overbought, and values below 30 are usually considered oversold. One screen I’ve been looking at recently includes both RSI and the Piotroski F-Score, which is a measure of financial strength on a scale from 0-9, with 9 being best. I run a bearish version of that where I look for stocks with an RSI over 80 and a Piotroski F-Score of 2 or lower, and I run a bullish one where I look for an RSI under 20 and an F-Score of 8 or better. As it happens, a gold miner comes up on this screen, one with an F-Score of 8 and an RSI below 20. Digging Deeper As with all mechanical screens, it’s best to do some further investigation, to eliminate false positives. For example, one of the stocks the bearish version of this screen picks up now is Reata Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RETA) where the RSI looks high because the company was just acquired by Biogen, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). In the case of our gold miner, I found a deep dive on it by an analyst who highlighted a few key facts about it. On the positive side, it has some of the highest margins in the industry, reporting all-in sustaining costs of about $700 per ounce, compared to an estimated industry average about $1,360 per ounce in the period. On the negative side, one of the company’s properties is in a state in Mexico that has some political risk (a history of strikes). Because of that, this analyst wrote he’d want a discount of 35% to his estimate of the miner’s fair value before investing. The stock is trading at a slightly bigger discount to his fair value estimate now, and by using options, we can potentially get it at an even bigger discount. We have a trade teed up to do just that.

2023-10-05,5 ETFs To Monitor When September Jobs Data Is Revealed On Friday,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the highly-anticipated September jobs report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Among the data investors will scrutinize are the non-farm payrolls (NFPs), which serve as an indicator of the rate of new job creation during the month. This data point, along with inflation, holds significant sway over the Federal Reserve’s decision-making process on interest rates. Investors are anticipating a decline in NFPs from 187,000 in August to 170,000 in September. Such a figure would represent a softening from the prevailing trend of monthly new job additions, which has averaged 194,000 over the past six months and 257,000 over the course of the past year. In addition to the NFPs, investors will be closely monitoring the unemployment rate, which is expected to decrease from 3.8% to 3.7%, and the year-on-year increase in hourly wages, forecasted to remain stable at 4.3%. Read Also: How The ‘January Effect’ Could Spark Tech Stock Renaissance In October, Q4 How The Jobs Report Influences Markets The employment market report holds the power to exert a profound influence on markets. Should the NFPs surpass expectations and hourly wages demonstrate a stable or higher-than-expected uptick, concerns about further interest rate hikes may escalate. Conversely, a more pronounced cooling in the labor market could lead market participants to anticipate that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current stance, at least until the upcoming meeting. As it stands, market-implied probabilities assign an 80% likelihood to the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates unchanged at the Nov. 1 meeting, according to CME Group Inc.‘s (NYSE:CME) FedWatch Tool. Following the release of the September NFPs data, the following five ETFs could experience pronounced volatility: Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund (NYSE:UUP): The U.S. dollar is highly sensitive to jobs data. A stronger-than-expected monthly employment growth is bullish for the dollar, as it solidifies the Federal Reserve’s commitment to higher interest rates, leaving room for potential rate increases. Conversely, a weaker jobs report is negative for the dollar, as it may suggest no further rate hikes. In the wake of the last stronger-than-expected jobs report, the dollar rose by 0.7% for the day. iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT): TLT is one of the most closely watched ETFs due to its high volatility in response to the recent ascent in Treasury yields. If the NFPs exceed expectations, it could exert additional upward pressure on Treasury yields, thus generating further headwinds for TLT. The last higher-than-expected NFP report in August (187,000 vs. 170,000) saw the TLT ETF drop by 1.9% in a single session. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ): Technology stocks are highly sensitive to Federal Reserve rate expectations, and as witnessed recently, rising Treasury yields have had a detrimental impact on the performance of the Nasdaq 100. Bulls of QQQ are hoping for a weaker-than-expected NFPs report. Invesco Solar ETF (NYSE:TAN): The solar sector has experienced a significant selloff over the past month, suffering losses exceeding 20%. This slump has been driven by a stagnant real estate market, with 30-year mortgage rates exceeding 7.3%, and the adverse effects of rising Treasury yields. A softer-than-expected September jobs report would be a boon for the solar industry, while a strong NFPs reading could exacerbate the downturn. VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX): Another sector that has been severely impacted by rising Treasury yields is that of gold miners. Over the past two weeks, GDX has experienced a 12% decline, as gold prices dipped to $1,810 per ounce due to the robust U.S. dollar and 10-year yields exceeding 4.70%. If the NFPs fail to meet expectations, gold could benefit, potentially leading to a decline in Treasury yields. The last stronger-than-expected NFP reading resulted in a 0.6% decline in the GDX ETF on the same day.

2023-10-17,Peter Schiff Foresees A 'Trifecta Of Doom' — Gold Bug Warns Of Entrenched Inflation And Loss Of Confidence In The US Economy,"Acclaimed economist Peter Schiff warned Tuesday about the potential impact of a rise in bond yields, oil, and gold. He referred to this as a “trifecta of doom,” indicating an entrenched inflation and dwindling confidence in the Federal Reserve and the U.S.’s fiscal solvency. #Bond yields, #oil, and #gold all look poised to rip higher. This trifecta of doom is a warning to investors of entrenched #inflation and a loss of confidence in the #Fed and fiscal solvency of the U.S. The next shoe to drop should be the dollar. The #StockMarket may be the last.— Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 17, 2023 What Happened: “This trifecta of doom is a warning to investors of entrenched #inflation and a loss of confidence in the #Fed and fiscal solvency of the U.S.,” Schiff tweeted. He further cautioned that the dollar could be the next to fall and that the stock market might be the last to react. On the same day, Schiff noted that Gold had shrugged off the day’s spike in bond yields to close nearly $3 higher. He noted that Gold mining stocks performed well on Tuesday with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) rising over 1.8%. “Maybe [gold traders] are finally realizing that while higher [inflation] is bearish for bonds, it’s very bullish for gold.” Gold shrugged off today's spike in #bond yields, to close about $3 higher on the day. Gold mining stocks were even stronger, with the $GDX rising over 1.8%. Maybe #gold traders are finally realizing that while higher #inflation is bearish for bonds, it's very bullish for gold.— Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 17, 2023 See Also: September Retail Sales Top Expectations As Consumers Defy High Inflation, Interest Rates Why It Matters: It should be noted that Spot Gold rose 0.1% to $1,921.86 per ounce as traders watched the ongoing Israe-Hamas conflict and looked out for the upcoming rate hikes. Gold COMEX December 2023 futures were up 0.27% at $1,940.90. The precious metal is typically considered a safe haven investment. Schiff’s comments echo his previous warnings about the state of the U.S. economy. In early October, Schiff criticized interpretations of core CPI data, claiming it misrepresented the real concept of inflation.

2023-10-18,Gold Miners Positioned For Upswing: Keep An Eye On This Leading Economic Indicator,"A fundamental gauge in the world of finance and economics has just provided a signal not to be underestimated. We are talking about the gold-to-copper ratio, which can offer valuable insights into the overall health of the global economy and financial markets. This ratio represents the strength of a safe-haven asset, such as gold, which tends to rise during periods of market and economic turmoil, in comparison to copper, often considered a barometer for industrial production and seen as the driving force behind global economic growth. In practice, it indicates how many pounds of copper one ounce of gold can purchase. As highlighted by SentimenTrader on social media platform X, the “copper-to-gold ratio has recently crossed a crucial threshold, signaling positive prospects for metals and mining.” When examining the chart, this indicator surpassed the value of 544 on Wednesday, reaching its highest level since the end of May 2023. The ratio is now approaching a significant resistance zone, marked by a triple-top pattern that occurred in December 2020, July 2022, and May 2023. Why Is Gold Rising? The conflict in the Middle East has so far benefited two commodities: gold and oil. While the increase in oil prices is primarily due to rising geopolitical and supply risks in the region, what has garnered more attention in recent weeks is the surge in gold prices. This is because not only has the price of gold risen by 6% since Hamas carried out terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, but it has also done so while Treasury yields and the dollar were on the rise, breaking its usual negative correlation with these variables. According to Otavio Costa, a partner and macro strategist at Crescat Capital, gold appears to be on a path toward reaching $2,000 per ounce again, indicating the potential for a significant breakout that could mark the beginning of another long-term cycle. Costa referenced a statement made by Ray Dalio: “If you don’t own gold, you know neither history nor economics.” Gold approaching $2,000/oz again, now poised for a historical break out that could mark the beginning of another long-term cycle.Ray Dalio put it succinctly:If you don't own gold, you know neither history nor economics pic.twitter.com/FZSBCo7FZm— Otavio (Tavi) Costa (@TaviCosta) October 18, 2023 Gold Miners Outperformed Gold miners have emerged as the top-performing industry in October.
