2018-01-16,Greenlight's Q4 Letter Reveals Another Tough Quarter For David Einhorn,"It's been a tough couple of years for value investors, and Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn has a lot of explaining to do to his investors in his Q4 letter, which was sent out Tuesday. In a year in which the S&P 500 gained 20 percent, Greenlight Capital generated just a 1.6 percent gain as the market continued to reward growth over value. Burned By Shorts In the fourth quarter, the S&P 500 gained 6.6 percent compared to a 1.6 percent loss for Greenlight. Einhorn’s long positions, led by General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) have been performing relatively well in recent months. However, Einhorn’s basket of short bets, which include Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:CAT), Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), athenahealth Inc. (NASDAQ:ATHN), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), obliterated most of Greenlight’s gains from its long positions in 2017. “We believe all those stocks appeared priced with little margin for error entering the year, and none executed well or met fundamental expectations in 2017,” the letter read. Long Winners Einhorn remains long GM and said shares are still “significantly undervalued” given stability in the auto market, the stock’s 4.4 percent dividend yield, and aggressive share buybacks, GM’s 10 percent earnings beat in 2017 and its 7x forward PE ratio. In the fourth quarter, Greenlight’s biggest winner was Mylan NV (NASDAQ:MYL). Einhorn anticipates additional generic approvals for the company in coming months following its generic Copaxone approval in Q4. Greenlight’s second biggest winner was CONSOL Energy, which completed its long-anticipated split of its coal-centered business, Consol Energy Inc (NYSE:CEIX), from its oil & gas business, CNX Resources Corp (NYSE:CNX). Einhorn said both companies have high-quality resources and strong growth opportunities and quality management teams. New Positions Greenlight also initiated a couple of new positions in Q4, most notable a “small” new position in Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR). Einhorn said Twitter’s reacceleration of user growth in late 2017 makes for a strong pitch to advertisers in 2018. Greenlight also re-purchased a stake in Time Warner Inc (NYSE:TWX) and took new positions in ENSCO PLC (NYSE:ESV) and Brighthouse Financial Inc (NASDAQ:BHF). Greenlight also exited long positions in the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE) and Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE:RAD) and closed a short position in Deere & Company (NYSE:DE). Long-Term Perspective Despite another tough quarter for Greenlight, the firm has still delivered strong overall returns for long-term investors. Since its creation in 1996, Greenlight has generated an average annual return of 15.4 percent net of fees and expenses.

2018-01-24,This Day In Market History: The California Gold Strike,"Each day, Benzinga takes a look back at a notable market-related moment that happened on this date. What Happened? On this day 170 years ago, prospector James W. Marshall struck gold in Coloma, California and the great California Gold Rush began. Where Was The Market? Neither the S&P 500 nor the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around at the time. What Else Was Going On In The World? In 1848, construction on the Washington Monument began and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War and gave the U.S. possession of much of the modern-day American Southwest. At the time of the gold rush, the price of an ounce of gold was roughly $20. The Original 49ers Long before the NFL football team, the original 49ers journeyed across the country at a time predating a transcontinental railroad in search of a fortune in gold. Gold fever started in California when prospector James Marshall claimed he simply bent down and scooped up a dozen gold nuggets from a stream at John Sutter’s sawmill. Unfortunately for all of the 49ers, news of the gold strike didn’t reach the East Coast until August of 1848, and the journey out west took at least a month’s time. As a result, the rushers earned the nickname “49ers” because many of them did not reach California until 1849. Today, investors can make bets on the next big gold strike from the comfort of their own homes by buying the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) or any of its exploration-stage gold mining stocks.

2018-02-01,This Gold Mining CEO Thinks Cryptos And Gold Are Both 'Here To Stay',"The cryptocurrency craze has been likened to a gold rush mentality, but some see a relationship beyond the comparison. “The mania in the cryptocurrencies out there has definitely taken some of the speculative fervor out of the junior gold exploration companies, where these things have incredible runs on bull and bear market cycles,” US Gold Corp (NASDAQ:USAU) CEO Edward Karr told Benzinga. But Karr’s outlook on both assets is curiously consistent: “I think both are here to stay.” The Merits Of Cryptos For a gold guy, Karr speaks fairly thoughtfully of the ostensible enemy. “Cryptos have had this incredible rise over the last couple years,” he said. “Last year was just amazing. The younger generation, the 25- to 30-year-old millennials, they’re all very comfortable with cryptos, they like trading them and they see still very big potential upside.” He does anticipate the hype will dissipate, though. It's really interesting for the short-term phenomenon, but there’s definitely a speculative amount to it,” Karr said. “Like what we went through with the dot-com bubble going into the late 1990s ... probably the cryptocurrencies will have a little bit of a wash-out.” The Defense For Gold Cryptocurrency's stature isn’t seen to diminish the appeal of gold. As Karr sees it, the tangible asset has withstood the test of time both in substance and in value. An ounce of gold in the Roman Empire bought a custom-made suit of high-quality chainmail just as an ounce of gold today, at $1,350, buys a custom-made suit of high-quality fabric. “Over 2,500 years, that one ounce of gold gets you the same custom suit,” Karr said. “You can’t really say that yet for cryptocurrencies.” At the same time, Karr said the shiny brick will endure economic cycles, wars, geopolitical crises, computer crashes and grid failures, while the incipient cryptocurrencies haven’t yet proven their staying power. His confidence in gold echoes that of Goldman Sachs, which assured that the limited, unhackable resource is and will remain a relevant asset class in spite of cryptocurrency trends and its own lack of yield.

2018-02-05,Gold Miners Celebrate A Weakening Dollar: 'Inflation Is Coming',"The U.S. dollar continued its 2017 decline through the first month of the new year, and some expect no immediate relief. The trend is welcomed by US Gold Corp (NASDAQ:USAU) CEO Edward Karr. “It should be a really good year for gold,” Karr told Benzinga in a recent interview. “I think gold’s going to go higher.” Why The Correlation? Historically, commodities have risen with inflation. As equity markets weaken, investors diversify into “safe havens” like gold, the value of which remains globally steady. “Gold has been a good long-term inflation hedge, and as the dollar declines, inflation will increase, especially through energy input costs because the price of oil becomes more expensive,” Karr said. “ ... I think inflation is coming.” What Affects The Dollar? The dollar’s value is relative to those of competitors, so strength in global currencies reduces the power of the dollar. Some economists attribute recent weakness to growth, particularly in Asian economies. The Federal Reserve can also drive a value change. Increasing interest rates incentivizes saving or bond investing, which causes deflation and increases the dollar’s value. Lowering interest rates triggers spending and economic growth, which causes inflation, reduces the dollar’s value and increases the appeal of non-yield-bearing assets like gold. A New Gold-Dollar Relationship Citigroup analysts recently argued the inverse correlation between commodities and the dollar has dissipated. “Commodity prices have traded in a strong inverse relationship with the U.S. dollar over the past decade or so, but this relationship broke down in late 2016 and the breakdown looks here to stay, the Citi analysts said. Merrill Lynch recently acknowledged the trend but said the correlation between commodities and the dollar remains. It's absolutely true that even though in the course of 2017 the correlation between oil commodities generally, and the dollar, has weakened, it is still a very very big driver,” Sabine Schels, head of fundamental commodities research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told CNBC. “And the causality really goes from the dollar to commodity prices.” Related Links: Where Experts Stand On Bitcoin After 40% Plunge This Gold Mining CEO Thinks Cryptos And Gold Are Both 'Here To Stay'"
2018-02-23,Traders Scamper Back To Gold Miners ETFs,"Amid an uptick in equity market volatility, some traders are seeking refuge in a familiar place: gold. Market participants are also renewing their enthusiasm for some gold miners exchange traded funds (ETFs), including leveraged fare. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest non-leveraged gold miners ETF, surged nearly 4 percent last week as traders flocked to the fund. “Investors piled into VanEck’s Vectors Gold Miners exchange-traded fund last week to the tune of $529 million, the most since September 2013,” reports Bloomberg. “The ETF holds shares of mining companies including Newmont Mining Corp. and Barrick Gold Corp. Gold meanwhile rallied after two weeks of declines.” Not surprisingly, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:NUGT) and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:JNUG) are getting some love, too. What The Data Say Last Friday, traders allocated $16.1 million to NUGT, good for the largest total among all Direxion leveraged bullish ETFs, according to issuer data. Conversely, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:DUST) suffered outflows of $27.2 million last Friday, the worst total among the issuer's bearish funds. NUGT attempts to deliver triple the daily returns of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index, the same index GDX tracks. DUST tries to deliver triple the daily inverse returns of that benchmark. DUST and NUGT can be among the most volatile leveraged funds in the Direxion stable, reminding traders that the best use of these products as over intraday time frames. No leveraged ETF should be used for long holding periods and that is particularly true of the leveraged gold miners products, bullish or bearish. Leaning Bullish While money is flowing back to some traditional gold miners ETFs, traders are leaning bullish with leveraged fare. For example, over the past month, NUGT is averaging daily inflows of $7.11 million while its small-cap counterpart, JNUG, is averaging inflows of nearly $1.4 million, over that period, according to Direxion data. On the other hand, DUST and the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:JDST) are averaging daily outflows over the past month. Related Links: More Highs For This Retail ETF.

2018-04-11,A New ETF Of ETFs For Diverse Asset Allocation,"A new exchange traded fund aimed at providing diverse asset allocation while limiting volatility debuted Tuesday. The VanEck Vectors Real Asset Allocation ETF (NYSE:RAXX) provides exposure to real assets using the ETF-of-ETFs model. RAXX “seeks to maximize real returns while seeking to reduce downside risk during sustained market declines by allocating primarily to exchange-traded products that provide exposure to real assets, which include commodities, real estate, natural resources and infrastructure,” according to VanEck. The new ETF debuted holding 10 other ETFs, six of which are VanEck funds. RAXX can hold up to 12 ETFs and can go to 100-percent cash in the event of elevated market stress. The RAXX Report RAXX allocates over half its weight to just two ETFs: the PowerShares Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 Portfolio (NASDAQ:PDBC) and the VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE:MOO). The actively managed PDBC features exposure to a broad basket of commodities, including West Texas Intermediate crude, Brent crude, wheat, natural gas, zinc, aluminum, corn, soybeans, gasoline and gold. Speaking of gold, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU), the two largest gold ETFs, combine for about 20 percent of RAXX's roster. RAXX holdings “provide exposure to agribusiness, coal, infrastructure, real estate, steel, oil services, unconventional oil and gas and gold mining companies, as well as diversified commodity futures exposure and physical gold,” according to VanEck. Income And Adventure RAXX provides some income-generating potential with modest exposure to master limited partnerships via an almost 5-percent weight to the Global X MLP&Energy Infrastructure ETF (NYSE:MLPX). The new ETF also debuted with some higher beta sector and industry plays, including the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSE:OIH) and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). “RAAX performance is dependent on the performance of underlying funds and is subject to the risks of the underlying funds’ investments,” according to the issuer.

2018-10-11,Gold ETF Fee Battle Intensifies,"While gold and the related exchange traded funds are struggling this year, some investors remain fond of the yellow metal and some ETF issuers are rewarding that faith with lower expenses. Upstart ETF issuer GraniteShares announced a new, reduced annual expense ratio for the GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR). What To Know BAR debuted in August with an annual fee of 0.20 percent, or $20 on a $10,000 investment. At the time, BAR was the least expensive gold ETF on the market. While the environment for gold has been challenging since BAR came to market, some investors are displaying enthusiasm for the low-cost gold ETF. BAR has about $280 million in assets under management, easily making it one of the most successful commodities ETFs to come to market last year. Why It's Important BAR's low fee inspired fee cuts and the debut of competing, low-cost gold funds, but GraniteShares is taking its low-cost leadership. The company announced it's paring BAR's annual fee to 0.1749 percent, or $17.50 per year on a $10,000 investment. That renews BAR's status as the least expensive gold fund currently available to U.S. investors. BAR's fee cut was announced as some analysts are forecasting a rebound for the yellow metal and precious metals miners. Although there is little evidence that inflation is accelerating (as of now) or that the end of this bull market is imminent, we argue that gold miners should be given a larger weight in investors’ portfolio for the following reasons: i) the economic cycle continues to mature; ii) asset valuation multiples are expanding and asset bubbles are emerging in certain areas; iii) budget deficits are increasing at alarming rates; and iv) quarterly earnings will face tougher comps in 2019, bringing into question how much longer this record-breaking bull market can continue,” said CFRA Research equity analyst Matthew Miller in a recent note. What's Next BAR and rival gold ETFs could benefit from short covering as bearish traders have recently load up on short gold positions. “For the week ending September 25, money managers increased their speculative gross long positions in Comex gold futures by 609 contracts to 98,513, while short positions increased by 1,823 contracts to 182,190. This means that gold’s net short position is 83,677 contracts,” according to Miller. “The gold market could be poised for a short-covering rally, as investors are likely to start closing out their record level of short positions, given gold’s resilience to not break below key levels of support.” Related Links: A New IPO ETF Bell Tolls For These Leveraged ETFs"
2018-11-29,Powell Pushes Gold ETFs Higher... Sort Of,"The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) and rival gold-backed exchange traded funds traded modestly higher Wednesday after Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said interest rates are close to “neutral.” Three interest rate hikes this year and the subsequently stronger dollar are among the most widely cited reasons for explaining gold's struggles this year. What Happened GLD, the largest gold ETF by assets, entered Wednesday with a year-to-date loss of 7 percent before gaining 0.37 percent on above-average volume. “Interest rates are still low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of the level that would be neutral for the economy--that is, neither speeding up nor slowing down growth,” Powell said in a speech at The Economic Club of New York. Why It's Important Higher interest rates are seen as a drag on gold because the yellow metal and the related ETFs don't pay a coupon or interest, leaving little incentive for income-starved investors to embrace bullion in rising rate environments. Still, GLD has been a solid performer for the bulk of the Fed's current tightening cycle. Over the past three years, a period in which the Fed has hiked rates eight times, GLD is up about 12.4 percent while the dollar is flat. Even with Powell's somewhat bullish comments, markets are pricing in an almost 83 percent of another interest rate increase next month, according to CME Group data. Some investors are bullish on gold for 2019. According to Legg Mason's Global Investment Survey 2018, “23 percent of investors said that they see gold as one of the best investment opportunities next year, unchanged from 2017,” reports Kitco News. What's Next A sustained rally for gold could lift downtrodden gold miners stocks and ETFs, assets that are dirt cheap on valuation but vulnerable to gold lagging other investments. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, gained 2.49 percent yesterday, adding to a modest fourth-quarter gain.

2019-02-21,Spike In Miners ETF Volume Matched By Leveraged Peers,"The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest gold miners exchange traded fund listed in the U.S. saw major volume spike Wednesday following a huge uptick in turnover on Tuesday. Some of the leveraged gold miners ETFs also saw big jumps in turnover. What Happened On Wednesday, 62 million shares changed hands in GDX, well above the ETF's average daily volume of 49 million. GDX “saw trading volume spike to its highest in two months Tuesday,” reports Bloomberg. “About 90 million shares worth over $2 billion exchanged hands, double the fund’s usual volume and more than any other U.S. ETF that day. GDX is the largest materials ETF and tracks corporations that are primarily involved in mining gold and silver.” Why It's Important GDX is up 9.72 percent this year and those good vibes are being felt by the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:NUGT). NUGT, one of the most heavily traded leveraged ETFs, attempts to deliver triple the daily returns of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDMNTR), the same index GDX follows. On Wednesday, 16.21 million shares changed hands in NUGT compared with average daily volume of 9.57 million shares. As Bloomberg notes, some precious metals ETFs have been shedding assets this month and some of the increased volume in GDX could be a case of selling. GDX has seen year-to-date outflows of just over $551 million. What's Next While investors have been trimming exposure to GDX, data confirm some traders are piling into the leveraged NUGT. For the five days ended Tuesday, Feb. 19th, NUGT saw inflows of $40.30 million, by far the largest inflows of any leveraged Direxion ETF during that period, according to issuer data. On Tuesday, Feb, 19th, NUGT added $9.84 million in new assets, a total surpassed by just two other Direxion ETFs on that day. Related Links A Better EM ETF A Unique Junk Bond ETF"
2019-02-24,Merger Mania Could Be Golden For Miner ETFs,"The gold mining industry could be altered by more consolidation — a development that could alter the landscape for relevant gold miners exchange traded funds. News broke Friday that Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) is considering merging with rival Nemont Mining Corp. (NYSE:NEM), a move that would create the world's largest gold miner. What Happened As of Friday, Feb. 22, Barrick and Newmont combined for 19.46 percent of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest gold miners ETF. Barrick, the world's second-largest gold miner, recently acquired Randgold Resources. The company is considering a $19-billion deal for Newmont, according to some media reports. “A deal between the two world's largest bullion miners would create a mega-gold corporation, with assets in almost every continent, including Australia, Africa, the U.S. and Latin America,” reports Mining.com. Why It's Important Newmont is working on a deal to acquire Goldcorp Inc. (NYSE:GG), GDX's seventh-largest holding at a weight of 4.76 percent. If that deal is scuttled, Barrick would have to pay a $650-million breakup fee, according to Mining.com. Newmont's $10 billion for Goldcorp, which was announced last month, would create the world's largest gold miner in terms of market value and production. Pan American Silver Corp. (NASDAQ:PAAS), a smaller GDX holding, is acquiring Tahoe Resources Inc. (NYSE:TAHO) for nearly $1.1 billion. Barrick's move to acquire Randgold Resources, which was announced in September, is seen as the deal that kickstarted much-needed industry consolidation. If Barrick and Newmont come together, Goldcorp could be left without a partner, and smaller players in GDX's lineup — such as Anglogold Ashanti Ltd. (NYSE:AU) and Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC) — could become takeover targets as well. What's Next Gold miners have worked to improve balance sheets, reducing debt following some ill-timed acquisitions at the height of the commodities cycle. Improving balance sheets, coupled with the need to bolster reserves because most of the world's easy-to-access bullion has already been mined, could spur increased industry consolidation. GDX and other gold miner ETFs have made habits of lagging broader equity benchmarks during the recent bull market in domestic stocks. From 2013 through 2018, 2016 was the only year in which GDX beat the S&P 500. Related Links: A Kraft Killer For This ETF Sneaker Plays With These ETFs"

2019-08-29,Gold's Rally Has Miners ETFs Strutting Their Bull Market Stuff,"Gold's recent rally is providing predictable benefits to some other popular exchange traded funds, those being miners products, including the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). What Happened Bullion is being bolstered by global central banks on multiple fronts. Not only are central banks, in both developed and emerging markets, seemingly racing to lower interest rates, many of those banks are also gobbling up gold. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest ETF backed by physical holdings of gold, is indeed in a bull market and that status is important. “Bull markets can be classified as either secular (long term) or cyclical (bull phases within an overall bear market),” said VanEck in a recent note. “Before its $1,400 per ounce breakout in June, gold appeared to be tracking, on a technical basis, similar to its 36-month cyclical bull market from 1993 to 1996. However, its current $1,500 price level hints at a potentially longer, sustained rally—perhaps more similar to the secular gold bull market of 2001 to 2008.” Why It's Important Not all gold rallies are met with corresponding upside by ETFs like GDX, but this time is proving different because miners have worked through balance sheet issues that plagued the group several years ago and have diligently reined in costs. Those catalysts along with some valuations that still reside on the more attractive side of the ledger powering GDX and rival ETFs higher. Over the past 90 days, GLD is higher by 19.3%, but GDX is outperforming the bullion-backed fund by a margin of roughly 2.5-to-1 over that span, indicating that if this gold bull market is potentially long-lasting, GDX's year-to-date gain of 44.7% could be the start, rather than the end of something. “Gold stocks, on average, have historically outperformed gold during gold bull market cycles in the past—including through both cyclical and secular periods,” according to VanEck. “This typically occurs because of their optionality to gold through earnings and resource leverage.” What's Next As for what's next for the miners, the aforementioned moves to shore up balance sheets by paring leverage could bode well for the group's fortunes should gold remain in bull market. “For senior or mid-tier miners, these efforts could translate to nearly 60% increases in free cash flow, on average, for a gold price move from $1,400 to $1,600,” said VanEck. “We believe that this makes a compelling case for gold stocks at the moment and, in particular, given their attractive valuation on both an absolute and relative basis.” Related Links: A Virtuous Bond ETF Inside High Dividend ETFs"

2019-11-19,13 Stocks With The Highest Average Daily Trading Volume,"One of the most basic but useful metrics a stock trader can watch is daily trading volume. Volume is simply the total number of shares that change hands in a given time period. Essentially, volume is an indication of how much attention the market is paying to a stock. A high volume means lots of trades and/or very large trades. Technical stock traders often use volume to confirm breakouts or other signals. A technical signal is often considered much more meaningful if it's accompanied by heavy trading volume. Why Average Daily Trading Volume Is Important In addition to average daily volume, traders will often watch for large changes in volume. Volume tends to spike during periods of capitulation, which can mark the end of a long-term trend. In addition, steadily rising daily volume over an extended period of time could be a sign a stock is forming a base in anticipation of a catalyst or big move. At the same time, if volume tapers off as a stock price rises, it could be a signal the stock is running out of buyers and could soon be reaching a peak or pullback. Other more advanced technical trading metrics, including on-balance volume, Chaikin money flow and Klinger oscillator, are all based on changes in trading volume. Here are the 13 stocks and funds listed on major U.S. exchanges with the highest average daily trading volume, according to Finviz: Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE:CHK), 71.1 million shares. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), 63.2 million shares. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY), 62.2 million shares. General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), 58.5 million shares. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Indx (NYSE:EEM), 57.1 million shares. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), 53.2 million shares. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), 51.9 million shares. Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF), 49.6 million shares. CR SUISSE AG NA/VELOCITY SHS DAILY (NASDAQ:TVIX), 38.2 million shares. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), 34.7 million shares. BARCLAYS IPTH SRS B S&P SHRT TRM ETN (BATS:VXX), 34.2 million shares. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO), 33.4 million shares. AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), 30.4 million shares. Benzinga’s Take The 13 stocks and funds mentioned above are some of the most popular and highly liquid stocks in the market. However, the volume of stocks like Nio and Chesapeake Energy may give an overly inflated impression of the market’s interest given volume is measured in shares and stocks like Nio and Chesapeake have share prices of under $2. For example, a 100-share Chesapeake trade would be worth $64, whereas 100 shares of volume in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) would be worth $175,253. Do you agree with this take?

2020-01-08,"Benzinga Pro's Top 5 Stocks To Watch For Wed., Jan. 8, 2020: GDX, BA, CVS, LK, PIXY","Benzinga Pro's Stocks To Watch For Wednesday VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) - This ETF, which tracks the price action of gold mining-related assets, saw extreme volatility over Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning's sessions following retaliation by Iranian forces on 2 US bases in Iraq. Spot gold spiked to a high of $1,613.30/oz Tuesday evening but sold off sharply Wednesday. In Wednesday's pre-market session, gold last traded at $1,574.20/oz. Boeing (BA) - Shares were down 1% following news Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 crashed near Tehran. The Boeing-manufactured plane, a 737-800, is considered the predecessor to the highly-controversial 737 MAX plane. CVS Health (CVS) - The stock was down about 1.5% in sympathy following worse-than-expected Q1 results out of Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). Walgreens shares were down nearly 6% following the quarterly report. The other peer in the drug store space, Rite Aid (RAD)​, was down 0.2% ahead of the open. Luckin Coffee (LK) - The company announced a 12 million ADS offering Tuesday evening. Shares traded down about 3.5% Wednesday morning. ShiftPixy (PIXY) - Shares were up more than 200% following news the company completed a recapitalization and said it closed a contract assignment worth $20 million. Probably one of the most important things for traders considering action in this stock Wednesday: ShiftPixy is a known low-float play, with just ~300K shares in its float. Low-float plays should be considered one of the most volatility ideas in a given day."
2020-01-08,Gold's Santa Claus Rally Followed By Surge On Iranian Tension,"Gold prices have continued to surge this week as tensions between the U.S. and Iran drive investors toward safe harbors. Gold prices increased $50 in the opening trading days of 2020 and then reached their highest levels since 2013 in the wake of Iranian missile attacks on military bases in Iraq. The commodity was trading at $1,554.62 per ounce at the time of publication. Bethel Loh, a macro strategist at ThinkMarkets, said in a note that it's a classic demonstration of risk-off, as markets took to gold with no hesitation, pushing the shiny metal well past third-quarter 2019 highs of $1,557. Benchmark crude oil prices also rose following the U.S. airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Iranian Quds force. “The gain of 1.52% sees the risk-off hedge ink new highs not seen since 2013. Fears that Iran will disrupt major oil infrastructure, not dissimilar to when drones attacked Saudi Arabia, also saw Crude futures gap at the open and sustain above key psychological level of US$70/bbl,” Loh said. A Santa Rally In Gold Gold initially traded higher throughout the Christmas holiday in a move known as a Santa Rally due to increased demand combined with thin liquidity in FX at the year's end, said Olivier Konzeoue, an FX sales trader at Saxo Markets. “The escalation of tensions in the Middle East has since sent gold to a seven year high, as markets seek refuge in a traditional safe haven in times of uncertainty. We expect gold to redeem some of its recent gains at the first signs of de-escalation.” The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was trading down 1.08% and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was trading down 4.37% at the time of publication.

2020-01-09,Gold Miners ETF Becomes A Dividend Idea,"With a yield of just 0.39%, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) doesn't scream dividend fund, but the largest gold miners exchange traded fund is making some progress on that front. GDX's dividend yield is poised to rise and not because the fund's price is falling. Rather, some of its largest components have recently unveiled significant dividend increases. Gold miners may increase cash returned to shareholders as gold prices rise but should exhibit more caution than in past bull cycles, Fitch Ratings said in a recent note. Greater discipline around capital allocation and an emphasis on sustainability of dividends when trends are bearish is anticipated, given an emphasis on maintaining financial and operating flexibility. Moreover, a focus on improving cost positions and optimizing assets due to declining availability of high-quality assets and growing interest in long-term cash generation should curb widespread shifts in financial strategy. Why It's Important Newmont Goldcorp (NYSE:NEM), the largest component in GDX at 11.73% of the fund's weight, started 2020 on the right now, announcing a major dividend hike on Monday. “Newmont announced a 79% quarterly dividend increase to 25 cents/share on January 6, stating the action aligns with its disciplined approach to capital allocation that entails maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet, investing in profitable growth and returning cash to shareholders,” notes Fitch. “Newmont recently initiated a stock repurchase program of up to $1 billion but is targeting net debt/EBITDA of below 1.0x over time, post its 2019 purchase of Goldcorp.” Yamana Gold (NYSE:AUY), which accounts for almost 2% of GDX, also recently boosted its payout. Yamana recently increased its dividend to five cents/share annually, following a doubling of its dividend to four cents/share annually in July 2019, as part of a gradual and progressive approach to dividend increases, according to Fitch. What's Next Last year brought a flood of new assets to gold ETFs as prices climbed and the stage could be set for more of the same this year as interest rates remain and geopolitical tensions run high. Higher demand due to gold's countercyclical characteristics and safe haven status along with a modest supply outlook is positive for gold prices, further improving industry cash flow, according to Fitch. CRU expects the price of gold to average $1,558/oz in 2020, after averaging $1,390/oz in 2019, with total supply of 3,611 tonnes and total fabrication demand of 2,719 tonnes, resulting in a fundamental balance of approximately 892 tonnes.

2020-02-14,7 Ways To Invest In Gold Amid Coronavirus Fears,"The COVID-19 virus outbreak has certainly made investors uneasy, and the idea of a deadly global pandemic is cause for concern. One traditional safety trade for investors is to buy gold or gold mining stocks. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 3.8% so far in 2020, but the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is down 2.7%. If the new coronavirus spreading in China ultimately triggers a global economic downturn, gold prices may spike, sending gold miner margins and profits soaring. Some gold miners are better investments than others. Here are seven gold miner stocks to buy, sell and hold, according to Bank of America. Buy: Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) Analyst Michael Jalonen recently said Newmont is making good on its capital return pledge after the company raised its dividend by 79% starting in April. Newmont also plans to boost its share buybacks by up to $1 billion. The company is also refreshing its brand, changing its name from Newmont Goldcorp to Newmont Corporation. Jalonen said Newmont’s impressive project pipeline, robust free cash flow and solid balance sheet make it his top North American senior gold producer stock pick for 2020. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $52 price target for NEM stock. Buy: Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) Freeport-McMoRan is the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer and the eighth-largest gold producer. Analyst Timna Tanners recently said Freeport’s 2020 cost guidance was disappointingly high, but risks associated with the company’s shift from open pit mining to block cave mining now appear to have subsided. Tanners expects profits will normalize by 2021 once all the costs associated with the transition have passed. Ultimately, she said the transition will lead to higher production, lower costs and more byproduct credits from gold. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $14 price target for FCX stock. Buy: Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM) Agnico Eagle is a mid-tier Canadian gold mining company that operates multiple mines in Canada, Finland and Mexico. Jalonen recently said Agnico has entered a period of cash harvesting following several years of aggressive investment. Management said that cash will be used for internal investment, paying off debt and raising the stock’s dividend. Now that construction at Amaruq and Meliadine is complete, Jalonen said Agnico is well-positioned for significant free cash flow growth. Agnico is guiding for 2020 gold production growth of 10%. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $74 price target for AEM stock. Sell: AngloGold Ashanti Limited (NYSE:AU) AngloGold has 14 gold mining operations in 10 countries. Analyst Patrick Mann recently said AngloGold management is making all the right moves in focusing on returns, but the stock is overvalued following its 44.6% gain in the past year. An unpredictable global regulatory environment creates cash flow uncertainty, particularly regarding AngloGold’s operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania, the analyst said. A sale of the company’s South African operation at fair value would be a bullish catalyst for the stock, he said. Bank of America has an Underperform rating and $18.40 price target for AU stock. Hold: Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC) Kinross is one of the world’s largest gold producers, with operations in the U.S., Brazil, Russia and West Africa. Kinross is guiding for 2.4 million gold equivalent ounces of production in 2020. Net debt dropped from $1.47 billion in the third quarter to $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter. Kinross generated about $100 million in cash from asset sales last quarter and Jalonen is projecting $427 million in free cash flow in 2020. Bank of America has a Hold rating and $5.85 price target for KGC stock. Buy: Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) Barrick just reported an impressive fourth-quarter earnings beat and raised its dividend by 40%. Jalonen said Barrick’s gold production outlook for 2020 is in-line with his expectations and at the high end of the company’s previous guidance, and its copper division is on solid ground as well. Barrick ended 2019 with 71 million ounces of gold reserves, up 14.5% from a year ago. The company used its $429 million in free cash flow to fund its dividend hike and pay down debt in the fourth quarter, the analyst said. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $22 price target for GOLD stock. Buy: B2Gold Corp. (NYSE:BTG) B2Gold is a global gold producer with operations focused in the Philippines, Namibia and Mali. It also has 50% ownership of the Colombian Gramalote gold project. In January, analyst Lawson Winder added the Gramalote project to his valuation, and estimated its value at about $250 million, or 24 cents per B2Gold share. Gramalote should begin production in late 2023 and boost 2024 production by about 25%, the analyst said. B2Gold has a strong cash position to fund growth and return capital to shareholders, he said. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $4.75 price target for BTG stock. Related Links: 7 Cannabis Stocks To Buy, Sell And Hold 7 Stocks To Buy Under $5"
2020-03-19,Gold ETFs Betray Safe-Haven Reputation In March Market Meltdown,"At a time when investors are desperate for safe-haven assets, gold and the related exchange traded funds aren't providing the expected shelter from the storm. This month, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), which had been on a torrid pace entering March, is lower by 5.7%. Gold miners ETFs have been much, much worse. On Wednesday alone, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) plunged nearly 23%, bringing its month-to-date loss to 32.67%. That after gold notched its biggest one-day rally since 2016 on Tuesday. From a technical standpoint, it appears bears control the gold future market right now. “Technically, April gold futures bears have the firm overall near-term technical advantage,” reports Kitco News. “Gold bulls' next upside near-term price breakout objective is to produce a close above solid technical resistance at $1,600.00. Bears' next near-term downside price breakout objective is pushing prices below solid technical support at this week’s low of $1,450.90.” See Also: Trump Signs Coronavirus Relief Bill, ECB Injects $821B In Liquidity, Japan Considers Cash Payouts Bearish Betrayal...Or Not Proving that leveraged ETFs, particularly those involving gold miners, must be treated as short-term instruments, all four of the bellwether geared funds focusing on this segment are in red this month. Yes, even in the inverse products. Take the case of Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:DUST). DUST attempts to deliver triple the daily inverse returns of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. Even amid a rough stretch for gold and the miners, DUST was scuffling this month. Until Wednesday when DUST surged 31.79% on more than double the average daily volume. A similar situation is scene with DUST's small-cap counterpart – the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE:JDST) – is lower by more than 60% over the past week and that's with the benefit of a Wednesday gain of almost 22%. The Bull Case Timing reentry into the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:NUGT), the bullish equivalent of the aforementioned DUST, is historically tricky and that task is even more so following NUGT's Wednesday slide of 49.34%, but some market observers believe there are still tailwinds for the miners. “The fiscal and monetary measures currently being taken rival those seen during the housing crisis of 2008/2009, a time when owning gold and miners was extremely lucrative,”according to Schaeffer's Investment Research. “Higher government spending and stimulus generally equates to higher prices in metals, and conversely a lower U.S. Dollar. Should this trend continue, further quantitative easing and government stimulus should push prices in these sectors even higher.” Assuming those good vibes for miners materialize, ambitious traders could look to the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE:JNUG), which is coming off a Wednesday loss of almost 61%, which pushed its March decline to over 90%."
2020-03-19,"Gold Analyst Says Prices Will Stabilize At $1,600 Once Market Panic Subsides","Gold’s safe haven status has been challenged further this week as gold prices continue to decline. The commodity was down to $1,498 on Thursday as world stock markets continued to slump due to the coronavirus pandemic. More risk-averse investors have been displaying a marked preference for the dollar at the expense of bullion, according to FXTM analysts. “Gold has been left in the dollar’s wake, as investors rush to lap up the greenback amid a liquidity crunch and fears that the global economy is hurtling towards a recession, said Han Tan, market analyst at FXTM. With volatility in gold prices at its highest since 2008, bullion has not been spared by the market panic. Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter. Once the liquidity squeeze eases and gold prices find more stable footing, investors concerned about the global economic outlook should eventually come back to the precious metal and send prices towards $1,600, according to FXTM. For the immediate term, should bullion prices weaken further, stronger support is set to arrive at the $1,400 psychological level, Tan said. Once gold is allowed to rediscover its equilibrium, that should serve as a platform for bullion to make its way toward $1,600, the analyst said. Price Action The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was trading down 0.53% at $139.95 at the time of publication Thursday and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was trading up 7.27% at $21.11.

2020-03-31,3 ETFs Trading At Steep Price-To-Sales Discounts To Post-Crisis Averages,"With markets still grappling with the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis, it seems like the global financial crisis was ages ago. Then again, the latest crisis bears reminders of the prior one, including depressed energy prices, stress in the corporate bond market and duress in the mortgage-backed securities arena. One might think that given the length of the just completed bull market coupled with the fact that this bear market arrived in rapid fashion that no exchange traded funds are trading at valuation discounts today compared to where they were in March 2009. In reality, as the ETF Research Center (ETFRC) points out, there are several well-known ETFs trading at steep price-to-sales discounts today relative to levels seen on March 31, 2009. Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter. Here are a few examples of that phenomenon. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) The energy is loaded with stocks and ETFs trading at depressed multiples and the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE:XOP) is one of the prime examples of that trend. “But demand for oil will eventually recover and with it so will the fortunes of the survivors in the E&P business,” said ETFRC. “At just 0.23x forecast sales--though again that multiple could rise as forecasts are cut further--investors seem overly pessimistic in our view, compared to how they valued these same companies back in March 2009, at 0.86x sales, not to mention an average P/S multiple of 1.2x since mid-2006!” XOP's price-to-sales discount today compared to March 31, 2009 is a staggering 73%. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest fund in this particular category, may be one of the more attractive options among the deeply discounted funds identified by ETFRC. Gold miners are in better financial shape today than they were five or six years ago, many GDX components are prioritizing cost synergies and are firming up balance sheets. Although this is historically volatile segment of the ETF market, it's hard to ignore that there's a case for gold with central banks debasing currencies – a case that is likely to grow if inflation arrives. GDX's price-to-sales discounted is a whopping 66% to March 31, 2009 levels. Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (VWO) A long-running battle cry of emerging markets bulls is that these stocks are cheap. Discerning whether this asset class is full of value or value traps is a different matter. There are valid reasons why emerging markets equities are saddled with depressed multiples relative to broader U.S. equity benchmarks, not the least of which is slack performance. For the six years ending 2019, the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE:VWO) outperformed the S&P 500 on just twice on an annual basis. In three of those six years, VWO generated negative returns so perhaps it's not surprising that the largest emerging markets ETF trades at a 42% discount to its March 31, 2009 price-to-sales ratio, according to ETFRC. Disclosure: The author owns shares of VWO."

2020-04-22,"Gold Analyst Says Rally Is Short-Term, Prices Will Recede To $1,600 By Year's End","Gold has rallied over the past month, but it's a short-term rally, according to one analyst. If the global economy finds its feet over the second half of 2020, safe haven purchases of gold are likely to ease substantially, with the commodity's price falling back to $1,600 by the end of 2020. On Wednesday, the shares of several gold and silver companies were trading higher as equities gained amid a potential stabilization in oil prices. Capital Economics analyst Oliver Allen said that while gold has rallied over the past month, he doesn’t think that it will continue to outperform most other asset classes. The GSCI Precious Metals Index, in which the weight of gold is 90%, will be the worst-performing headline index among those tracked by the Capital Economics asset allocation service, he said. The index has returned almost 15% over the past month, Allen said. Of the headline indices that we cover on our Asset Allocation Service, only a handful have fared better over the same period. This has mainly reflected a surge in the price of gold, from just under $1,500/oz. to roughly $1,700. What Triggered The Recent Gold Rally? Gold’s rally has resulted primarily from two developments, the analyst said. The first is an unwinding of the fire sales that took a toll on safe, as well as risky, assets during the first half of March, as the turmoil in markets that followed the spread of the coronavirus around the world reached its peaked. The subsequent fall back in the bid-ask spread for gold suggests that this pressure has now eased considerably. The second trigger is massive policy support from the Fed, which pushed down nominal Treasury yields and led to a recovery in investors’ expectations for inflation, Allen said. “As a result, the real yields of those bonds fell by even more than nominal yields and so reduced the opportunity cost of owning gold, which is a 'real' asset that pays no income. Real yields tend to have a close relationship with the price of gold.” Allen predicts that the price of gold will fall back to $1,600 by the end of 2020. Price Action Gold prices were at $1,711.28 at the time of publication Wednesday. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was trading up 1.61 % at $161.16 at the time of publication Wednesday and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was trading up 4.91% at $32.06.

2020-04-30,"Mining Sector Hit By Coronavirus Lockdowns, Silver Production Walloped","The mining sector is seeing severe disruption, with activity being suspended across a number of countries due to the coronavirus pandemic and silver production affected. Thirty-two countries have issued partial or complete lockdown orders, leading to the temporary suspension of activities at over 1,600 mines as of April 3, according to GlobalData. Some exempted mines are also operating with reduced numbers of workers to minimize the potential spread of the virus, which is causing a slow return for the industry. Mining Regions Impacted Lockdowns remain in force in countries such as Peru until May 10, Mexico until May 30, Bolivia until April 30 and Namibia until May 4. In Quebec, the government has extended restrictions to May, but allowed mines to reopen from April 15 onward as essential services if they comply with strict measures to limit the spread of the virus. Restrictions on mining in India, Argentina, Zimbabwe and South Africa have also been withdrawn, with mining seen as an essential service. Silver Production Curtailed By Pandemic Vinneth Bajaj, mining analyst at GlobalData, explained why silver production is being severely damaged by lockdown measures. “As of 27 April, the equivalent of 65.8% of annual global silver production was on hold. Silver mining companies such as First Majestic Silver Corp. (NYSE:AG), Hochschild, Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) and Endeavour Silver Corp (NYSE:EXK) have all withdrawn their production guidance for 2020 in the wake of the outbreak,” he said. Progress has also been halted on 23 mines under construction, including the $5.3-billion Quellaveco copper mine in Peru, which is one of the world’s biggest copper mines under development, according to GlobalData. “The project has an annual copper production capacity of up to 180kt and is expected to commence operations by 2022. In Chile, while a lockdown is not in force, Antofagasta has halted work on its Los Pelambres project and Teck Resources has suspended work on the Quebrada Blanca Phase II mine,” said Bajaj. Supply Disruption Will Be Short-Lived Supply disruptions due to the pandemic are occurring, but there is the potential that these will be relatively short-lived, said Bryan Slusarchuk, CEO of Fosterville South Exploration. Mining companies will adapt safety and health protocols in an attempt to meet this challenge, and mining is an essential industry around the world, he said. “Safety and health always must remain the number one priority for mining companies, so the focus is on safe operations while mining to provide the critical materials that all of us need.” Good Environment For Gold From a precious metals perspective, the environment has never been better for gold, Slusarchuk said. “Gold has been a store of wealth, a currency and a hedge against uncertainty for thousands of years and, geopolitically, monetarily and socially, there is an extreme amount of uncertainty out there.” Price Action The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was down 1.8% at $158.80 at the close Thursday, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was down 5.2% at $32.26 Related Links: Gold Analyst Says Rally Is Short-Term, Prices Will Recede To $1,600 By Year's End Barrick Gold Reports Q2 Earnings Beat"
2020-05-18,"Strategist Expects Gold, Silver To Gain As Pandemic Panic Subsides","Gold and silver prices rallied Monday amid market strength as news from a Moderna Inc (NASDAQ:MRNA) trial stoked optimism about a potential coronavirus vaccine. On Monday, June gold futures were trading at $1,733 and July Comex silver prices were at $17.39 per ounce. “Gold and gold stocks had a strong month, recovering all of their March losses and moving to long-term highs,” Joe Foster, portfolio manager and strategist at VanEck, said in a note. Hedging With Gold As the pandemic market panic subsides, investors are trying to gauge the risks and opportunities in a world that carries a level of uncertainty that only those with memories of the Great Depression and World War II have experienced, the VanEck strategist said. “Continued strong inflows to bullion exchange traded products along with strong demand for retail coins indicates both institutions and individuals are turning to gold as a store of value and hedge against uncertainty,” Foster said. On April 9, gold jumped $40 per ounce when the U.S. Federal Reserve unveiled its $2.3-trillion program to aid local governments and small- and mid-sized businesses. “It [gold] went on to a new seven-year high of $1,747 per ounce on 14 April, then consolidated its gains around the $1,700 level. Gold ended the month at $1,686 per ounce for a $109 (6.9%) gain,” he said. Banks 'Can't Arbitrarily Print' Gold The trillions being injected into the economy via quantitative easing alongside monetary and fiscal stimuli devalues and debases paper currency, said Bryan Slusarchuk, CEO of Fosterville South Exploration. “Gold is the only currency that central banks can't arbitrarily print more of, and as such it is the only currency that acts with stability during a time of crisis,” he said. With more and more paper currency in circulation, the currencies become inherently worth less and less, the CEO said. Price Action The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was down 0.57% at $163 at the time of publication Monday, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was down 1.56% at $36.

That's good news for gold miners ETFs, which are already among 2020's leading industry funds. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest fund in the category, is rewarding investors taking a chance on what's usually a volatile product. The fund is higher by nearly 23% year to date. GDX and its small-cap counterpart — the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) — have a way of crowding out the other ETFs in this group, but some of the other undiscovered funds here are turning in great performances in their own rights. With that in mind, here are some hidden gems of the gold miners ETF space to consider. Sprott Gold Miners ETF (SGDM) The Sprott Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:SGDM), which has recently been making a series of all-time highs, is an odd choice for an overlooked because it's neither small nor young. Just a couple of months shy of its sixth birthday, SGDM has $240.5 million in assets under management. The fund is a departure from cap-weighted rivals such as GDX. SGDM follows the Solactive Gold Miners Custom Factors Index, which focuses on “larger-sized gold companies with the highest revenue growth, free cash flow yield and the lowest long-term debt to equity,” according to the issuer. Low debt, well-capitalized firms, regardless of industry, are rewarding investors this year and that's true in the precious metals mining space as SGDM is higher by 24% year to date. U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (GOAU) The U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE:GOAU) is truly unique among its gold mining ETF rivals because it blends exposure to production firms with royalty operators, which are passive participants in the industry. Royalty and streaming companies comprise about a third of GOAU's index. The fund follows the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners Index, which is rooted in quantitative analysis. There are some perks to the royalty exposure including reduced volatility, higher dividends and lower operating costs. GOAU is higher by almost 29% over the past month. Global X Gold Explorers ETF (GOEX) At nearly 10 years old, the Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE:GOEX) is one of the oldest products in this category and it's experiencing a renaissance this year as confirmed by a 27.49% surge over the past month. GOEX components have a weighted average market value of $1.98 billion, making this a small-cap play on gold explorers. That's a volatile combination, but it's one that can pay off if both gold and smaller stocks remain simultaneously remain firm."
2020-06-03,'Fast Money' Traders Weigh In On Gold,"On CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report, Meghan Shue said that short-term fundamentals suggest a mixed outlook for gold in the near term. She would look for a better entry point. Joe Terranova said he always likes to have gold in his portfolio because it offers diversification. He added that in the current environment, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) would work better than SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Pete Najarian also likes the miners and he would consider individual names that provide exposure to gold. He currently owns SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (NYSE:XME), which has a mix of metals and gold names."
2020-06-12,"Gold Rally Stalls As Prices Settle Around $1,700, Analyst Expects Further Pullback","A gold rally that followed the Federal Reserve's signal of no interest rate hikes through at least 2022 was dissipating Friday. The price of gold was around $1,735 at the time of publication. Gold's Safe Haven Rally: This year’s rally in gold has come on the back of a coronavirus-led surge in safe-haven buying and a plunge in interest rate expectations, according to Capital Economics. “We suspect that the uptick in the gold price has come from investors positioning themselves against the risk of inflation, though we don’t expect it to pick up much in the short term. As such, we think the gold price will fall back by year-end,” Capital Economics commodities economist James O'Rourke said in a research note. The analyst expects gold will come under pressure from fading safe-haven demand, falling to $1,600 per ounce by year-end. “We expect U.S. interest rates to remain at their lower bound going forward, so the gold price is unlikely to benefit from a further fall in rate expectations anytime soon. And unless the virus takes a turn for the worse, we think safe-haven demand will wane too as the global economy recovers, ultimately weighing on the gold price,” O'Rourke said. Temporary Pullback In Gold? Bryan Slusarchuk, CEO of Fosterville South (FSXLF:OTC), said the underlying fundamentals for gold are extremely strong: quantitative easing infinity, a low-to-negative interest rate environment and unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimuli. “Paper currency is being devalued both intentionally and unintentionally and the result will be higher values ascribed to the only currency that can’t be printed, the CEO said. Slusarchuk said this “temporary pullback” is a combination of profit -aking and continued strength through Thursday in the U.S. market. “When the larger markets level out or correct, and the underlying factors supporting gold strength become more broadly known, gold will take the next leg up in what is a once in a generation gold bull market en route,” he said. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.49% at $163.19 at last check, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 0.43% at $32.97.

2020-06-22,What Does A 'Second Wave' Of COVID-19 Mean For Investors?,"The stock market recovery made more progress on Friday, but the latest COVID-19 data is increasingly raising concerns that a second wave (or just another crest of the first wave) of infections could be imminent as the U.S. economy opens back up. If those concerns ultimately result in another economic lockdown, some of the best-performing stocks since the March bottom could once again take the biggest hits. On Thursday, the U.S. reported 27,700 new coronavirus cases, and the seven-day average for new cases is up 15% compared to a week ago. Cases in 27 different states are up at least 5% week-over-week, according to Johns Hopkins University. If the U.S. economic reopening gets derailed or a second wave of COVID-19 slams the nation, it’s likely many of the same stocks that underperformed during the initial downturn will also be hit by a second wave of selling. Benzinga is covering every angle of how the coronavirus affects the financial world. For daily updates, sign up for our coronavirus newsletter. Strongest And Weakest COVID-19 Stocks By far the hardest-hit sector of the market from the February peak to the March bottom was the energy sector. From Feb. 19 to March 23, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) dropped 57%, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Explore & Prod. (NYSE:XOP) dropped 60.5% and the VANECK VECTORS /OIL SVCS ETF NEW (NYSE:OIH) declined 70%. While the selling was broad-based during that time, some market sectors held up relatively well, especially compared to energy stocks. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was down just 26.2%, the Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR (NYSE:XLP) was down 24.5% and the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (NASDAQ:IBB) was down 21%. If a second wave of coronavirus once again results in a steep drop off in oil demand, underperforming stocks like TechnipFMC PLC (NYSE:FTI) and Noble Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:NBL) could be some of the hardest hit. In addition, cruise stocks like Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH) and Carnival Corp (NYSE:CCL) were also among the worst-performing stocks during the initial wave of coronavirus infections. Finally, retail stocks like Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) and Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) were crushed during the first round of brick-and-mortar store closings. Benzinga’s Take The economic and market reaction to a potential second wave of COVID-19 outbreaks will ultimately hinge on two factors. The severity of the wave will likely be the primary factor, but the willingness (or potential lack thereof) of business leaders, politicians and consumers to shut down the country a second time will also play an important role in the economic impact of a possible second wave of coronavirus.

2020-07-08,"Gold Passes $1,800 Mark For The First Time Since 2011, ETFs See Increased Inflows","Gold prices surpassed the $1,800 mark for the first time since 2011 on Wednesday as a resurgence in coronavirus infections sends investors toward safe haven investments. The Gold Landscape: The environment is still looking very good for gold and gold miners, Arnaud du Plessis, portfolio manager specializing in precious metals and natural resources at CPR Asset Management, says in an emailed note. “Central banks are staying on full alert as the resurgence of COVID-19 in some parts of the world is creating fears of a second-wave. This unique situation is generating growing interest in the barbarous relic, in the form of both the physical metal and gold-mining stocks able to offer investors potentially very significant performance leverage,” says Plessis. The profit outlook for the gold mining sector is continuing to improve, he says “Twelve-month profits have been revised up by more than 84% year on year, thus supporting the market trend. The substantial upwards revision of the average gold prices forecast for 2020, which now stand at $1,670/oz versus $1,554/oz at the end of March and $1,500/oz at the start of the year, have contributed to this trend.” Gold-Backed ETF Assets: The enthusiasm for physical gold is as strong as ever judging by the exponential growth in total gold-backed ETF assets, which reached new heights in June at 3,201 tonnes, says Plessis. “The equivalent of 86 tonnes was added in June, for example 622 tonnes since the start of the year, close to the record set in 2009 (644 tonnes for the full year). Note that the 385 tonne increase in assets in the second quarter of 2020 is the largest since 2016, “ adds Plessis. Fosterville South (OTC:FSXLF) CEO Bryan Slusarchuk says gold is a store of wealth, a hedge against uncertainty and a currency. We are in a period of quantitative easing infinity and are seeing monetary and fiscal stimuli like never before. There is huge printing of all paper currencies right now and as the saying goes, the Fed can’t print more gold. So, inherently, gold is becoming more valuable every day,” he says. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.63% at $170.10 at last check, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 1.78% at $38.40.

2020-07-19,Stock Market Update For The Week Ahead: 'Cautious Attitude',"The Last Week In A Nutshell What Happened: “U.S. stocks are closing in on record highs. But behind the scenes, uneasy investors are keeping their options open,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment officer for Ally Financial Inc-owned (NYSE:ALLY) Ally Invest. “They’ve bought gold at a historical pace, boosting the metal’s price to nine-year highs. Same goes for Treasuries, which is why yields are at all-time lows. Lately, we’ve seen that cautious attitude spread to the U.S. options market. A gauge of market worry (the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX) is stuck at higher-than-average levels, even though stocks are hovering just below their own highs.” Remember This: You have monetary and fiscal policy pushing the economy out of a problem and that is very, very bullish, said Andrew Slimmon, senior portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) Investment Management. When you have these extreme accommodative policies it is because there is a problem in the economy. Investors historically focus on the problem and are cautious, yet that’s when you want to get most optimistic. Pictured: Profile chart of the S&P 500 E-mini Futures Technical: Broad-market equity indices balanced higher last week, as seen in the responsive, tight trading range. Recapping Last Week’s Action: On Monday, the S&P 500 gapped higher, outside of a prior balance area, but failed to continue, rotating back into the prior week’s range. Tuesday’s session continued Monday’s selling activity, but reversed just short of the prior balance area low. After news that Moderna Inc’s (NASDAQ:MRNA) COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine produced antibodies, Wednesday’s session saw prices pushing higher, gapping beyond Tuesday’s range. Buyers attempted to burst through the resting liquidity at $3,230, but failed with prices later following the Nasdaq’s relative weakness lower to close the overnight gap. After some mixed economic data, Thursday's session was dominated by responsive activity, balancing out near Wednesday’s V-bottom low, with sellers lacking conviction the most via the minimal excess low. Alongside monthly options expiry, Friday’s session continued Thursday’s tone, with the intraday trading range remaining tight and responsive. Looking beyond broad market indices, the innovation-driven, technology-based sectors are showing signs of relative weakness, while other sectors, such as industrials, energy and financials are rotating higher off recent support. Overall, the market is in a three-day balance that it’s likely to break come next week.

2020-07-28,3 Unheralded Gold ETFs That Are On Fire,"Precious metals, namely gold and silver, are in the midst of epic rallies. On Monday, silver exchange-traded funds extended what are becoming meteoric rises while gold hit an all-time high. On volume that was nearly double the daily average, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest bullion-backed ETF, jumped 2%. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) joined the party, too, gaining almost 5% on above-average turnover, extending its year-to-date gain to roughly 50%. Indeed, these are exciting times for gold ETFs, an arena largely dominated by GLD and GDX. However, there are some other options for investors to consider here. Let's have a look at a few here. GraniteShares Gold Trust (BAR) In the U.S., the market for physically-backed gold ETFs is mostly dominated by the aforementioned GLD, but there are some admirable competitors. One of those is the GraniteShares Gold Trust (NYSE:BAR). GLD is a fine choice for active traders that need tight spread, deep liquidity and a robust options market. For longer-term investors looking for cost savings, BAR and a couple of other names are the way to go. In fact, BAR, which turns three years old next month, touched of a gold ETF fee war when it debuted in August 2017. The fund charges 0.1749% per year, or $17.49 on a $10,000 investment, making it one of the least expensive funds in this category. That's meaningful as highlighted by BAR's $1.1 billion in assets under management. More importantly, the fund is up 27.73% year-to-date and hit an all-time high yesterday. U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (GOAU) Much GLD looming large in the gold-backed ETF arena, the aforementioned GDX does the same among miners funds, but the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE:GOAU) is a credible idea to consider. GOAU, which hit an all-time high Monday, devotes 30% of its weight to the three largest gold royalty companies. The remaining 70% of the ETF's weight is allocated to 25 miners scored by momentum in revenue, free cash flow and high-gross margins on a per-share. GOAU hit $100 million in assets early this month, about a month after celebrating its third birthday. VanEck Merk Gold Trust (OUNZ) The VanEck Merk Gold Trust (NYSE:OUNZ) recently had its fee clipped to 0.25% from 0.40%. OUNZ is one of the niftier ideas in the gold ETF space because when an investor sells shares of the ETF, he or she can take physical delivery of gold, a trait not offered by rival funds in this category. OUNZ gained almost 2% yesterday on volume that was nearly triple the daily average on its way to a record high."
2020-08-03,Gold Just Hit An All-Time (Nominal) High—How To Play The Trade With ETFs,"Gold bugs who were in front of their screens on Sunday night witnessed history for the second week in a row. At the 6 pm ET open on August 2, the spot price of gold rose to $2009.50 per ounce, a new all-time high on a nominal (non-inflation adjusted) basis. It was the second week in a row that gold made a new all-time high in the Sunday night session, as the same thing happened the evening of July 26. Spot gold is up almost 36% over the previous 12 months, a stunning turnaround for an asset that drastically underperformed equities for the last decade. For those investors who stayed the course and the traders who’ve been betting on upside, Sunday night was validation. So why did gold just make a new all-time high? It’s 2020—the real question is why not? The safe-haven asset has the benefit of several macro tailwinds playing out at the same time. The EU’s record-breaking $858 billion bailout package combined with near-zero interest rates from global central banks has signaled that monetary easing and fiscal stimulus will be more than a short-term reality. At the same time, rising tensions last week between the U.S. and China has set the stage for another geopolitical showdown, which carries with it far more unknowns than any market (or person, for that matter) should be comfortable with. And all this is to say nothing of the fact that coronavirus cases continue to rise in the U.S. How To Play Gold Via ETFs As gold has ascended in recent months so too have gold ETFs, as many traders and investors use them to get exposure. According to the World Gold Council, gold-backed ETFs added $5.6 billion worth of assets in June, their seventh consecutive month of global positive flows. And based on July’s performance, that streak could continue. Take the two largest gold miners ETFs by assets: the VanEck Vectors® Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX, )) and the VanEck Vectors® Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ, )). The pair has returned 42% and 38% respectively in 2020, as of August 3. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of GDX (candles) compared with GDXJ (purple line). Source: Benzinga Pro; Data as of August 3, 2020 The strength in GDX can be attributed to names like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corp (NYSE:FNV), and Wheaton Precious Metals Corp (NYSE:WPM). Combined, the group makes up over 38% of the fund and is up an average of 60% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the strength in GDXJ can be attributed to top holdings Gold Fields Ltd (NYSE:GFI) (up 98% YTD), Kinross Gold Corp (NYSE:KGC) (up 97%), and Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE:AUY) (up 64%), which combine to make up nearly 17% of the fund. For investors interested in gold bullion, the VanEck® Merk® Gold Trust (NYSE:OUNZ) actually allows investors to own physical gold via their ownership of the ETF and even take delivery of the gold they own, if desired. Note that taking delivery of gold does come with a fee. In short, market risk is very much on. And when risk is on, so is gold."
2020-08-04,How To Play Gold's Recent Surge Right Now: Don't Buy Gold?,"Gold managed to break above a nine-year base and completed its best monthly gain since 2016. So what's the best way to play the surging commodity? Wheaton Precious Idea: The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) has outperformed the physical commodity but has since become a little bit overbought, Piper Sandler senior technical research analyst Craig Johnson said on CNBC. If the ETF pulls back, it might be good to buy on the dip and investors may want to consider diversifying to other names. One idea is Wheaton Precious Metals Corp (NYSE:WPM), Johnson said. The stock remains in an uptrend from March lows and showing no signs of breaking down. The relative strength has also been nicely improving. As I go through our entire work that we got where we basically break down the entire marketplace into relative strength rankings, the gold, mining [and] silver groups are all making 26-week relative strength new highs and absolute new highs inside of our work, he said. I think as a technician and investors, you can't really ignore that. Related Link: Gold Just Hit An All-Time (Nominal) High—How To Play The Trade With ETFs What About Copper? Gold has not proven to be a good hedge against inflation compared to stocks, Laffer Tengler Chief Investment Officer Nancy Tengler also said. Gold is more akin to a safety play but metals like copper is a leading indicator on the economy. We think this is bullish for the economy and we also think it's bullish for stocks, she said. But as the political calendar start to take over, Tengler said the commodity could see a correction followed up with a move to higher levels."

2020-08-24,3 Gold ETFs Seeing Brisk Short Covering Activity,"Thanks in large part to demand by investors opting for gold exchange-traded funds, gold is one of this year's hottest assets. However, the yellow metal, like any other security, doesn't move up in a straight line. The largest gold ETF enters Monday 6.39% off its 52-week high after trading modestly lower last week. Two interesting things to consider here. First, gold ETFs dipped last week even amid rampant short covering. Second, there's a massive amount of short interest in some marquee gold ETFs to be unwound. Three gold ETFs “landed in the top ten most short covered ETFs league table over the last week with $160 million worth of new buy-to-covers. Gold’s +28% move for the year and hitting its year to date high in early August may be squeezing some Gold ETF short sellers out of their positions,” according to S3 Partners research. Here are those three ETFs. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Up almost 40% this year, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is chastening bearish traders. Last week, the largest gold miners resisted the commodity's decline, rising 1.34% on news that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) took a stake in Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD). That stock is GDX's second-largest component at a weight of just over 12%. More than $90 million of short interest in GDX was covered last week, but short interest as a percentage of the ETF's float is still close to 10% and valued at $1.76 billion, according to S3, meaning it will take some time for shorts to cover this trade. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD) is the largest physically-backed gold ETF and a favorite of professional traders on both sides of the bullish/bearish spectrum, owing to robust liquidity and tight spreads. Traders covered almost $30 million worth of GLD shorts last week, but there's still $2.62 billion of short interest in the benchmark gold ETF, equivalent to 3.37% of the fund's float, notes S3. As is the case with GDX, it's likely to take bearish traders weeks, not days, to unwind that GLD short. iShares Gold Trust (IAU) Traders covered almost $40 million worth of bearish exposure in the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) last week, whittling short interest in that ETF $93.57 million. That's just 0.30% of the float, indicating those shorts could cover in rapid fashion if need be. “Short sellers in these three Gold ETFs are down -$760 million in year-to-date mark-to-market losses,” notes S3. Dislcosure: The author owns shares of IAU."
2020-08-26,"Here's How Much Investing $1,000 In The GDX Gold Miners ETF In 2010 Would Be Worth Today","Investors who owned stocks in the 2010s generally experienced some big gains. In fact, the SPDR S&P 500's (NYSE:SPY) total return for the decade was 250.5%. But there’s no question some popular investments did much better than others along the way. Gold Miners’ Difficult Decade: One lagging performer in the last decade was the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). The GDX ETF started out the 2010s trading at around $47.70. For the first year and a half of the decade, gold prices were on fire, rallying from around $1,100 per ounce to as high as $1,923/oz in mid-2011. Investors were scooping up gold on concerns that the massive stimulus action taken by the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 would eventually lead to significant inflation. Unfortunately for gold investors, that inflation never materialized and the $1,923 level represented peak gold prices of the 2010s. Given the GDX trades largely in-line with gold spot prices, the fund peaked in mid-2011 at $66.98, its decade high. Sluggish inflation numbers, 0% interest rates and steady economic growth over the next several years made gold an afterthought for many investors. The GDX fund drifted steadily lower over the next four years, eventually bottoming out at $12.40 in early 2016. Gold prices spiked in early 2016 to new two-year highs, and the GDX fund followed suit, peaking at $31.79 in mid-2016. The breakout coincided with concerns over the impact of a surprising Brexit vote in Europe. GDX In 2020 And Beyond: After initially dropping to $16.18 during the market sell-off in March, the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequent stimulus efforts once again have the GDX trading higher. The fund recently hit $45, its highest level since 2013. Despite the recent rally, the GDX fund hasn’t been a particularly great overall investment in the past decade. In fact, $1,000 GDX shares in 2010 would be worth about $861.10 today, assuming reinvested dividends. The good news for GDX investors is that if the fund continues to follow its 2008 financial crisis pattern, it will not peak for more than two years after the stock market bottom in March of 2020.

2020-10-31,Gold Price Predictions If Biden Or Trump Wins Presidency,"The 2020 U.S. election is taking place on Nov. 3 with President Donald Trump and former VIce President Joe Biden battling for the lead position. Gold Price Analysis: The U.S. presidential election will play a huge role in shaping the global economy and gold prices are expected to react in the run up to the election day. So how important is it for the safe haven asset gold if Biden or Trump makes it to the White House? “There is no doubt that we are likely to see increased volatility in stock markets in the run up to the election day and investors seeking traditional safe havens such as gold, particularly if the race between the two candidates gets very close and there is a growing risk of a contested outcome,” writes Saida Litosh, manager of precious metals analysis at Refinitiv. Biden or Trump Impact: If the past is any indication, a second Trump administration would mean a “turbulent and polarizing first term” which in turn would add further volatility and uncertainty, although the potential for radical policies could be lower in the second term should Congress remain divided, Refinitiv highlights. However, a Biden win would represent a return to a more conventional administration resulting in less volatility associated with political risks and international tensions. “Historically gold price movements in the aftermath of previous U.S. presidential elections suggests little evidence of a clear relationship between the gold price and the election outcome based on party affiliation,” says Litosh. Fosterville South Exploration CEO Bryan Slusarchuk says, for thousands of years, gold has acted as a hedge against uncertainty, a currency and a store of wealth. Both Trump and Biden have promised huge amounts of stimulus and huge amounts of easing. Both [Trump and Biden] have been vocally supportive of various policies that amount to quantitative easing and therefore gold ought to react well no matter who is elected,” says Slusarchuk. Stepping beyond financial conditions, which will serve to propel gold higher, we need to consider gold’s function as a hedge against uncertainty, says Slusarchuk. Gold Has Explosive Upside: Slusarchuk says this election is going to be perhaps the most divisive election in the history of the United States. It may be contested, the outcome may not be certain and its legitimacy will no doubt be challenged in some circles no matter which side is victorious,” says Slusarchuk. He believes a bitter, contested election would also potentially have many negative consequences and would represent the very definition of uncertainty which is something gold hedges against. I believe gold has explosive upside in the coming months and this is predicated on economic and financial conditions, but the uncertainty of the election outcome will only serve to accelerate its upward trajectory,” adds Slusarchuk. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.37% at $179 at the time of publication Monday, while the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 0.89% at $38.55."
2020-11-02,Carter Worth And Mike Khouw's GDX Options Trade,"Carter Worth of Cornerstone Macro spoke on CNBC's Options Action about assets that could provide safety in the current environment. Investors who want safety should look at gold and gold miners, instead of bonds and treasuries, thinks Worth. He would be a buyer of VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Etf (NYSE:GDX) because he thinks the pullback is over and the next direction for the stock should be up. Worth sees the recent price action as consolidation after a big move higher. GDX bottomed in March at $16, peaked in August at $46 and then it pulled back to its current price of $36. The pullback is a third of the move higher and Worth explained that stocks often find support after such a pullback. Mike Khouw wants to sell options to finance a bullish bet because of the high near-term implied volatility. He wants to sell the November 20, $36 put for $1.15 and the November 20, $40 call for $0.65. He would also buy the January $15, $38 call for $2.60. The total cost for the trade would be $0.80 and if the stock stays between $36 and $40 at the November expiration, the puts Khouw sold are going to expire worthless and his long call would have a breakeven at $38.80."
2020-11-04,Should You Invest In Gold Right Now?,"The price of gold is up 24.2% year-to-date in one of the most tumultuous years in history so far. With the possibility of a contested U.S. presidential election and a worsening pandemic in the coming weeks, things could become even more volatile on Wall Street, leading some investors to consider buying gold as a potential hedge against stock market weakness. There are plenty of reasons to invest in gold heading into the final two months of 2020 — and plenty of reasons not to. Here's an overview of the bull and bear cases. Related: Is Gold A Good Investment? Bull Case For Gold: The bull case for gold is that it's considered a stable hedge against inflation. The U.S. government has already issued more than $2 trillion in economic stimulus this year, and a potential blue wave on Tuesday would likely open the door for trillions more in Democratic stimulus in the first quarter of 2021. Inflation rates have lagged the Federal Reserve’s 2% target rate for more than a decade, but all this money printing may catch up to the U.S. dollar at some point. If inflation spikes, gold prices will too, and gold investors will be protected from the fallout. The last time the Federal Reserve issued massive stimulus measures was during the financial crisis in 2009. Gold prices rallied from under $700 per ounce in late 2008 to as high as $1,923.70 in mid-2011. If history is any indication, the 2020 rally in gold prices could continue for at least another year or two. Bear Case For Gold: Legendary investor Warren Buffett has done a great job of explaining the bear case against investing in gold. Unlike stocks or bonds that produce earnings, generate interest or pay dividends, gold has very little actual utility. “Gold will never produce anything ... it doesn’t do anything but sit there and look at you,” Buffett once said. To make matters worse, the world’s supply of gold is constantly growing. Although there is a finite amount of gold on the planet, the amount of gold available to buy and sell is increasing by more than 3,000 metric tons per year. The final case against gold is its historical performance. Since the beginning of 1990, the price of gold is up just 372.1% compared to a more than 1,700% total return from the S&P 500 in that time. How To Play Gold: The most popular way to invest in gold is the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), which tracks a gold spot price based on gold bars held in London vaults. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is a fund that holds a diversified portfolio of 54 gold mining companies. Investors can also buy individual gold mining stocks, such as Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) and Franco Nevada Corp (NYSE:FNV)."
2020-11-06,Gold Prices Surge As Dollar Drops,"Gold has been benefiting from a weak U.S. dollar and the uncertainty of the U.S. election outcome, with Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the lead but no election calls yet. Gold made gains this week and was trading at $1,952.28 per ounce at last check Friday. While the potential election of Joe Biden means a lot to various segments of the capital markets, I think the cake was baked for gold long before the vote, said Fosterville South Exploration CEO Bryan Slusarchuk . Bull Market For Gold: Regardless of who wins the election, the setup for a once-in-a-lifetime bull market in gold was in place due to bipartisan support for quantitative easing, unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus and a low-to-negative interest rate policy, said Slusarchuk. Gold is a currency, and right now it is the only currency in the world not being printed with reckless abandon in an effort to stave off a huge financial depression, he said. Therefore, inherently gold is becoming more valuable versus its competitors every day. I expect this to continue because quite simply the Fed can’t print more gold. As the uncertainty around the election continues, gold's strength over the mid- and long-term is underpinned by economic and financial conditions. “There is no doubt we may see some short-term fluctuations based on the extreme animosity between the two sides during the counting phase of the election and the fact that the election is being contested,” Slusarchuk said. The climate represents the best set of conditions for gold ever seen, the CEO said. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.14% at $183.19 at the close Friday. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 0.49% at $41.42. Related Link: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now?"
2020-11-17,"Q3 13F Roundup: How Buffett, Einhorn, Ackman And Others Adjusted Their Portfolios","The latest round of 13F filings from institutional investors is out, revealing to the world the stocks that some of the richest and most successful investors have been buying and selling. Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The third quarter of 2020 was an overall solid quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling heading into the holiday shopping season. Fund managers were dumping FANG stocks in the first quarter with a handful of exceptions. For example, Cooperman bought Alphabet. PG&E was one stock several fund managers were playing in the quarter. Tepper and Klarman were buying while Soros was selling. Buffett was aggressively buying health care stocks ahead of Joe Biden’s election victory. Bank stocks were popular among fund managers in the quarter, with most managers selling rather than buying. Cooperman sold JPMorgan, Buffett sold JPMorgan and Wells Fargo and bought Bank of America, and Soros sold Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Eingorn sold the GDX gold miners ETF and bought the GLD gold ETF. Soros made a big bet on tech stocks by buying the QQQ ETF and dumping the IGSB corporate bond fund. Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

2020-11-22,VanEck Report Says Bitcoin Less Volatile Than Many Stocks,"Bitcoin might be less volatile than some stocks, a study by VanEck shows. What Happened: Investment management firm VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Etf (NYSE:GDX) published a research paper on Friday comparing Bitcoin volatility to stock volatility. Volatility of the cryptocurrency has been linked to regulations, sensitivity to small total market size, and limited penetration in mainstream stock and capital markets, wrote the author of the paper, Gabor Gurbacs, VanEck's director of digital assets strategy. But, according to the paper, 145 stocks in the S&P 500 have had more price fluctuations year-to-date than the cryptocurrency has had this year. It also said Bitcoin demonstrated less 90-day volatility than 112 stocks on the S&P 500. Why It Matters: Crypto assets are often viewed as the most volatile assets since the subprime derivatives that brought about the Great Recession. The volatility is believed to be one of the main reasons institutional investors have hesitated to get involved. VanEck, a New York-based fund that manages about $50 billion in assets, launched an exclusive Bitcoin ETF product for its clients in 2019 and also has filed with the SEC for a Bitcoin ETF. Price Action: Bitcoin has been trading in the $18,400 range today. VanEck shares closed at $35.90, with a 1.07% gain, on Friday."
2020-11-30,"With Coronavirus Vaccine In Reach, Gold Faces Worst Month In 4 Years","The announcement of a vaccine protecting against COVID-19 has seen investor risk appetite rise, sending safe haven assets, including gold and the U.S. dollar, lower. The yellow metal is on track for the worst month in four years after trading at around $1,800 since mid-July. On Monday, gold was trading at $1,776. The price of gold will rise a touch as U.S. real yields fall a little further, said Capital Economics assistant commodities economist Samuel Burman. The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in China will offset any vaccine-induced boost to metals demand in 2021, the economist said. Is Gold’s Bull Market Over? The gold industry is exceptionally strong and is attracting both growth-oriented and value investors, says Fosterville South Exploration CEO Bryan Slusarchuk. It is one of the few sectors in the world that has a strong outlook for growing cash flows and growing margins in the year ahead, he said. The macro setup for gold represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for gold bulls, and it should be pointed out that when gold bullion prices are strong, gold equities often outperform the price of the metal itself, Slusarchuk says. While 2020 will be rightfully remembered for the terrible pandemic that ripped across the globe, it also marks the first time that there was near worldwide consensus amongst politicians from all political parties as it relates to spending and bigger government as a solution to cure all economic ills.” Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) lost 0.67% Monday, closing at $166.67.

2020-12-03,"New ETNs Bring Leverage, Spice To Gold Miners","Gold is hot this year and the miners are even hotter, a scenario bringing more light to the various leveraged exchange traded products that provide access to the companies extracting gold from the earth. What Happened: In other words, it's a good time for traders to consider some fresh approaches to bullion miners. REX Shares, the issuer behind the MicroSectors lineup of leveraged exchange traded notes, has those traders covered with a pair of new exchange traded notes (ETNs). The MicroSectors Gold Miners Leveraged 3X ETN (NYSE:GDXU) and the MicroSectors Gold Miners -3X Inverse Leveraged ETN (NYSE:GDXD) launch Thursday, joining well-known products, such as the MicroSectors™ FANG+™ Index 3X Leveraged ETN (NYSE:FNGU) and the MicroSectors™ FANG+™ ETN (NYSE:FNGS) in the MicroSectors stable. Why It's Important: GDXU and GDXD, the new geared gold ETNs, bring a unique approach. The products track the S-Network MicroSectors™ Gold Miners Index. That benchmark is a combination of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ), the two largest non-leveraged bullion miners ETFs by assets. The index is half allocated to the large-cap GDX and half allocated to the small-cap GDXJ. “Each ETN offers investors a return based on changes in the level of the S-Network MicroSectors™ Gold Miners Index on a daily compounded basis, before taking into account fees. Each ETN has a specified leverage factor that is reset daily,” according to MicroSectors. What's Next: Obviously, as leveraged products, GDXU and the bearish GDXD are expected to pack a punch, but that's certainly the case with these products because, on an unleveraged basis, miners are typically volatile bets. GDX has a three-year standard deviation of 33.23%, well above that of broader equity benchmarks and standard industry funds. The small-cap GDXJ has a three-year standard deviation of 38.68%, making it far more volatile than any traditional small-cap benchmark and confirming the MicroSectors ETNs could thrive when action heats up in the miners complex. With the debuts of GDXU and GDXD, MicroSectors offers over 21 ETNs, spanning FANG stocks, big banks, the energy sector, and the first leveraged cannabis products to list in the U.S."

2021-01-22,VanEck Is Planning An Equity-Based ETF That's A Spin On Crypto,"There still isn't a bitcoin exchange-traded fund in the U.S. When that's going to change is up for considerable debate, but in the meantime, investors have some other avenues to consider, including blockchain exchange-traded funds. What Happened: VanEck, an ETF issuer that's long had sights on a bitcoin ETF, is proposing another prescription: The VanEck Vectors Digital Assets ETF. The issuer revealed plans for the fund in a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. “Digital asset companies may include small- and medium-capitalization companies and foreign and emerging market issuers, and the Fund may invest in depositary receipts and securities denominated in foreign currencies,” according to the filing. Why It's Important: Assuming it comes to market, the Digital Assets ETF will follow the MVIS Global Digital Assets Equity Index. “To be initially eligible for inclusion in the Index, a company must generate at least 50% of its revenues from (i) digital assets projects or (ii) projects that, when developed, have the potential to generate at least 50% of their revenues from the digital assets industry,” according to the filing. “Companies with less than 50% of their revenues from the global digital assets segment, including semiconductor and online money transfer companies, may be added to the index to reach a minimum component number. Index component weights are based upon free-float market capitalization and individual components are limited to a maximum of an 8% weighting in the Index.” Information on the index is currently scant and the filing doesn't mention specific components. However, there are some qualifiers for membership, including “those that operate digital asset exchanges, payment gateways, mining operations, software services, equipment and technology or services to the digital asset industry, digital asset infrastructure businesses, or companies facilitating commerce with the use of digital assets, among others. They may also include companies which own a material amount of digital assets, or otherwise generate revenues related to digital asset operations.” What's Next: The filing does mention risks associated with investing in the financial services and technology sectors, indicating those groups could be found in the new ETF. On the other hand, the filing doesn't include a ticker or expense – signals that launch of the VanEck Digital Assets ETF isn't imminent."
2021-04-09,"The 'Boiler Room' Stock Pitch Recap: Northern Star Acquisition, Mogo, WISeKey, AutoZone And More","Every Friday, at 3 p.m. ET, Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown and Benzinga CEO Jason Raznick host The Boiler Room, a Clubhouse audio chat where listeners can pitch their favorite stock. Here are this week's pitches. Planet 13 Holdings (OTC:PLNHF) Planet 13 is a cannabis company based in Nevada. Aaron (@aaronpop) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Record revenue in March. The balance sheet is strong. Building numerous stores. You think it breaks out, Brown asked. I think it breaks out mid-Q2 or Q2 earnings but I wouldn’t be shocked if they get hit when the stock market drops again or there’s negative talk about federal legalization,” Aaron responded, giving the stock a $15-30 price target over a three- to five-year time horizon. Alpha Healthcare Acquisition Corporation (NASDAQ:AHAC) AHAC is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that plans to merge with Humacyte. Jackson (@jacksonalacarte) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Humacyte to go public in the summer. Minimal downside and cash in escrow. 5-year study to be presented April 20. Initiated at $20 by Lake Street Capital. You have this catalyst … and if the data is really bad, that would suck because the stock would trade down at least to where its cash-value is, Brown noted. The upside here is greater than anything else in the market,” Jackson responded. “I’m buying some today or Monday,” Raznick added. Northern Star Acquisition Corporation (NYSE:STIC) Northern Star is a SPAC that plans to merge with BarkBox, a subscription service provider of dog products and services. Marc (@miweber) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: 60% gross margin. 90% retention rate. Personalized offer. Merger in Q2 2021. There’s another one … and it hasn’t really been performing, Raznick said in reference to the industry losing the interest of Wall Street. We’re going to keep an eye on this one,” Brown added. Progyny Inc (NASDAQ:PGNY) Progyny is a benefits management company. Cesar (@juliuscesar_) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Fertility and family building offer. Earnings estimates look strong. Helping build and shape families. What’s their advantage, Brown asked. Their service has an outcome success rate of like 89% versus like 50% when it comes to regular insurance providers,” Cesar responded. Mogo Inc (NASDAQ:MOGO) MOGO is a mortgage loan company. Presley (@pretzel_pres) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Fintech company under the radar. Personal finance-based platform. JPMorgan says fintech is a threat. Similar to SoFi, impactful services. 90% of millennials using fintech. Bitcoin cash-back program offered. There are going to be probably four or five dozen fintech companies that all do some combination of extending credit, replacing physical bank payments, and so on; why would I buy MOGO, Brown asked. It is based in Canada so … they can dominate that market,” Presley responded. “The reason I got into Mogo — they reminded me of SoFi but based more in Canada,” Raznick added. “They’re acquiring assets, they want to be your credit card, … and they are making acquisitions.” WISeKey International Holding AG (NASDAQ:WKEY) WISeKey is a global cybersecurity company deploying digital identity ecosystems using blockchain. Rachel (@istomorrow) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Became involved with NFTs. Announced luxury auctions. Play on automation, drones. Putting chips inside drones. I interviewed the CEO and he was comparing it to Palantir. He said the reason their stock is not moving in the right direction is that they are a Swiss company and it’s hard for them to get credit, even though they have the same know-how and platforms, Raznick said. Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (NYSE:LPX) Louisiana-Pacific is a building materials manufacturer. Gabe (@gabealessi) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Diversified offer and global. 4 consecutive earnings beats. Breakout and bullish chart. Secular play, housing boom. This is like a homebuilding play … and there is a danger that this is priced in, Brown noted. “I think we’re under-housed and in a secular market for millennial household formation. I would wait for a red day and use the rising 200-day as my trailing stop.” AutoZone Inc (NYSE:AZO) AutoZone is a retailer of aftermarket automotive parts and accessories. Matthew (@ithacawealth) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Chip shortage, fewer new cars. Used cars to remain attractive. Boosting margins, room to grow. Why would you buy this instead of O’Reilly’s, Brown asked. Best in class management and stock is making new highs,” Matthew responded. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) GDX is a gold miners ETF. Mike (@nycmike) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Depressed, $31 acted as support. Positioned for a technical move up. Why would I buy GDX versus buying the GLD ETF, Brown asked. The $31 level is a clear line and [GDX] has that upside to it,” Mike responded. PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) PepsiCo is a multinational food, snack, and beverage company. Chris (@cpcapital) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Retooling and divesting from bad companies. Potential to develop multi-year partnerships. Taking cash and investing in new opportunities. They make all their money on food products. Are you owning it as a long-term investment, Raznick asked. I think they manage to execute regardless of the environment ... and I think it flys into the summer,” Chris responded. AmeriCold Realty Trust (NYSE:COLD) Americold is a publicly-traded REIT. Malcolm (@malcolmwestt) had a bullish outlook on the stock because of the following reasons: Facilities hold products for supermarkets. Storage for pharmaceutical companies. Do you foresee the stock continuing to work in a different environment than 2020, Brown asked. I do believe demand will fall a little bit but Americold has been buying up different companies, Malcolm responded. They bought 62 warehouses in Brazil … and have facilities spread out through Europe. Photo by Anna Nekrashevich from Pexels."
2021-04-11,Mike Khouw Lays Out Gold Play Through GDX Trade,"Mike Khouw suggested on CNBC's Options Action a bullish options trade in VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). Gold is one of the few risk assets that hasn't come along for the high-flying ride with everything else, said Khouw. While the market and risk assets are at all-time highs overall, gold certainly isn't, he said. Khouw sees opportunity in the underperforming gold as net-longs in the commodity have been increasing lately. Also, on a valuation basis, the gold miners are trading at lows they haven't seen since 2013, he said. To make a bullish bet, Khouw wants to buy the June $34/$39 call spread for $1.70. The trade breaks even at $35.70, or 2.79% above the closing price on Friday. If the stock jumps to $39 or higher, the trade is going to reach its maximal profit of $3.30."
2021-05-17,Options Traders See Stars Align For Gold Miners ETF,"VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) stock broke out Monday at the beginning of a seasonally bullish time for the gold sector. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) and other cryptocurrencies were trading lower Monday. Bitcoin and gold often move inversely to each other as traders follow trends relative to which investment is a better store of value at a given time. Fears of inflation could also help gold to fly higher, as the metal is believed to offer protection against the probability of rising prices as the economy recovers from the pandemic. A number of options traders believe these three events could make gold miner stocks soar and bet over $1.56 million the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF will trade higher.

Related Link: 3 Silver ETFs To Fight Inflation Why It’s Important: When a sweep order occurs, it indicates the trader wanted to get into a position quickly and is anticipating an imminent large move in stock price. A sweeper pays market price for the call option instead of placing a bid, which sweeps the order book of multiple exchanges to fill the order immediately. These types of call option orders are usually made by institutions, and retail investors can find watching for sweepers useful because it indicates “smart money” has entered into a position. GDX Price Action: Shares of VanEck Vectors were trading up 4.84% to $39.67 at last check Monday."
2021-05-18,"Q1 13F Roundup: How Buffett, Einhorn, Ackman And Others Adjusted Their Portfolios","The latest round of 13F filings from institutional investors is out, revealing to the world the stocks that some of the richest and most successful investors have been buying and selling. Takeaways From 13F Season: Investors who follow particular fund managers can easily look up what each was buying and selling in the quarter, but other investors may be more interested in overall themes from 13F filings. The first quarter of 2021 was a big quarter for the S&P 500, and investors were likely interested in what top managers were buying and selling to kick off 2021. Google parent Alphabet has the attention of fund managers, with Tepper selling and Soros and Klarman buying. ViacomCBS had a volatile quarter in part due to the unwinding of Archegos Capital, and fund managers took notice. Tepper and Soros were buying, while Klarman was selling. Buffett continued selling financial stocks and drug stocks and reversed course by selling Chevron just one quarter after taking a stake in the oil giant. Several fund managers traded ETFs to play particular themes. Despite inflation fears, Einhorn sold the GLD gold fund while Soros reduced his exposure to emerging markets by selling the EEM fund. Here’s a rundown of how the smart money was playing some of the most popular stocks last quarter.

2021-05-27,Are Gold Stocks Moving Back Into The Growth Phase?,"The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Etf (NYSE:GDX) has come back to life in recent months after a disappointing performance in the second half of 2020. On Thursday, Bank of America analyst Michael Jalonen said big gold stocks are currently transitioning to a period of significant production growth after a period focused on investment and capital returns. Jalonen highlighted the key themes among gold producers that attended Bank of America’s recent Global Metals, Mining & Steel virtual conference. Related Link: 10 Gold Stocks That Could Be The Next Buyout Targets In Industry Consolidation Wave “The key overarching theme: moving back into the growth phase,” Jalonen said. The Numbers: Some companies are much better positioned to grow production than others. Among all the gold stocks he covers, Jalonen said Wheaton Precious Metals Corp (NYSE:WPN) is projected to have the highest production growth over the next three years at about 30%. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. (NYSE:AEM) is a close second at just under 30%, followed by Franco Nevada Corp (NYSE:FNV) at around 25%. Jalonen said strong free cash flow is funding capital allocation priorities for Wheaton. For Agnico Eagle, Jalonen said the company is forging ahead with its proven long-term growth strategy. Franco-Nevada is a great stock for investors looking for a low-cost gold investment, Jalonen added. Bank of America has a Buy rating and $55 price target for Wheaton, a Buy rating and $80 target for Agnico Eagle, and a Buy rating and $163 target for Franco-Nevada. Even though Newcrest Mining ADR (OTC:NCMGY) has the lowest gold production growth outlook of the big gold group, Jalonen said the company has potentially hidden copper value. Benzinga’s Take: Gold prices are up just 9% in the past year, price action which is likely extremely disappointing for many investors given the more than $6 trillion in stimulus spending the U.S. government has performed in that time. For now, at least, it appears as though cryptocurrencies have taken the wind out of gold’s sails as the preferred inflation hedge among investors. (Photo: Jingming Pan via Unsplash)"
2021-06-17,Analyzing VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF's Unusual Options Activity,"On Thursday, shares of VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $35.69. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-08-20 Strike Price: $35.00 Volume: 889 Open Interest: 6581 Three Indications Of Unusual Options Activity Exceptionally large volume (compared to historical averages) is one reason for which options market activity can be considered unusual. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. Although the activity is suggestive of these strategies, these observations are made without knowing the investor's true intentions when purchasing these options contracts. An observer cannot be sure if the bettor is playing the contract outright or if they're hedging a large underlying position in a common stock. For the latter case, the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock may be more meaningful than bullish options activity. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-06-28,Unusual Options Activity Insight: VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF,"Shares of VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) saw some unusual options activity on Monday.

Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-07-16 Strike Price: $33.50 Volume: 3960 Open Interest: 516 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Out of the money contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. Out of the money occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price.

The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer).

2021-08-10,Mike Khouw Sees Unusual Options Activity In GDX,"On CNBC's Options Action, Mike Khouw said VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Etf (NYSE:GDX) traded two times its average daily put options volume on Monday. A lot of that activity was concentrated in the September 24, $28-strike puts as over 3,000 contracts were traded for 20 cents. Buyers of these puts are betting GDX could decline below $27.80, which would represent a decline of more than 14%."
2021-08-22,Carter Worth And Mike Khouw's GDX Trade,"Carter Worth of Cornerstone Macro spoke on CNBC's Options Action about gold. He said the precious metal bounced off three times from its support at $1,677, forming a triple bottom pattern. Worth has also noticed gold's relative performance to copper has started to improve, making new relative highs. He also expects the U.S. dollar to pull back, which should help gold advance higher, to $1,850. Mike Khouw wants to use options to make a bullish trade in VanEck Vectors Gold Miners Etf (NYSE:GDX). He wants to buy the October $31 call for $1.39 and sell the September $33 call for 30 cents. The total cost of the trade would be $1.09, which sets the breakeven for the trade at $32.09 or 0.78% above the closing price on Friday. If the September $33 call expires out of the money, Khouw can sell another call and lower his cost basis for the October $31 call."

Najarian has also noticed a purchase of 4,000 contracts of the November $33 calls in VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), all in one print. This tells him people are starting to diversify a little bit more. He likes both Occidental and GDX."
2022-02-14,"PreMarket Prep Plus: Trading Ideas For Time Of Tension Between Russia, Ukraine","Brent Slava, head of the Benzinga Pro Newsdesk, was spot-on with his topic for Monday’s segment on PreMarket Prep Plus: trading uncertainty amid global geopolitical news.” Nervous Markets: The rising tensions between Russia and the U.S. over a potential ground invasion of Ukraine has added even more uncertainty to an already volatile market. Slava offered several issues for investors to add to their watchlist under these conditions. Potential Armed Conflicts: At this time, it is difficult to anticipate the U.S. response if Russia proceeds with an invasion. No one knows how matters could escalate if this occurs. Therefore, it is important to follow the price action of defense contractors. Slava mentioned General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD), Lockheed Martin Group (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), and L3Harris Technologies Inc. (NYSE:LHX). Cyberattacks: In the event, the potential conflict extends into cyberspace, Slava noted a few issues that may draw investor attention. Three of the more widely followed issue are Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW), Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ:FTNT) and CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR). Another issue linked to a potential buyout from Microsoft Inc. (NASDAQ:MSFT), is the former Fireeye Inc., now known as Mandiant Corp (NASDAQ:MNDT). Foreign Markets: Slava mentioned two ETFs. One, the VanExk Russia ETF (BATS: RSX), tracks Russia, and to track the impact on Europe there's the Vanguard FTSE Europe ETF (NYSE:VGK). Flight To Quality: Recently, gold and silver have shown signs of strength that has not been seen in quite some time as a hedge for inflation. Slava mentioned three ETFs that may have another catalyst to drive prices higher. Those are the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). It should be noted that all three are trading sharply higher as of Monday afternoon."
2022-02-22,Ukraine Crisis Boosts Gold Names: A Gold Name Hits Our System's Top Ten For The First Time Since 2020,"Ukraine Crisis Boosts Gold Miners A few days ago, we posted Russian journalist Anatoly Karlin's assessment that there was an 85% chance of a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Subsequently, we posted a follow up noting that a missing piece--a casus belli--had fallen into place. Now, the President of the United States has predicted that Russia will invade Ukraine. The increasing certainty of war breaking out there seems to have finally given a boost to gold names including the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX). That was enough for our system, which gauges stock and options market sentiment, to put GDX into its top ten on Friday. Screen capture via Portfolio Armor on 2/18/2022. GDX represents a new theme in our top ten, which this year has often included industrial commodities names such as the iPath Series B Bloomberg Coffee Subindex Total Return ETN (NYSE:JO) and the Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bull 2X Shares ETF (NYSE:GUSH), chip names such as Nvidia, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA), and post-COVID reopenning names such as United Continental Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL). The Possibility Of A False Breakout As Sprott Money suggested on Friday though (Gold Breaks Out To The Upside), there is a possibility this has been a false breakout for GDX: GDX The bullish flag structure that I cited in each of the past 2 weeks has certainly come to fruition. GDX sliced through resistance at its red downtrend line and the 200MA and has broken the prior high of 34.48 back in November. However, it needs to close above 34.48. A drop back down below there would signal a fake breakout which is bearish. In Case We're Wrong About GDX In the event our system is wrong about GDX and this has been a false breakout, below are a couple of ways longs can limit their downside risk over the next several months. Uncapped Upside, Positive Cost As of Friday's close, these were the optimal puts to hedge 1,000 shares of GDX against a greater-than-25% decline by mid-June. This and subsequent screen captures are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app. The cost here was $510, or 1.48% of position value, calculated conservatively, based on the ask price of the puts (in practice you can often buy and sell options at some price between the bid and ask). Capped Upside, Negative Cost If you were willing to cap your possible upside at 30% between now and mid-June, this was the optimal collar to hedge against a >25% drop over the same time frame as of Friday's close. Here the cost was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $80 when opening this collar, assuming, to be conservative, that you placed both trades (buying the puts and selling the calls) at the worst ends of their respective spreads. The Best Hedge Against A Market Drop Although gold and oil names may rally further in the event Russia invades Ukraine, if you're concern is protecting your stock portfolio against a market downturn, the best hedge against that would be to buy optimal puts on index ETFs that correlate closely with your stocks, such as the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSE:SPY)."
2022-03-15,Good As Gold: Investors Haven't Given Up On The Traditional Safe Haven,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is down 11.4% year-to-date in 2022, but one age-old flight-to-safety investments is holding up just fine. The price of gold is up 9.5% so far in 2022. SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is up 4.6% year-to-date, while the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is up 13.7%. Gold Solves This: Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) bulls have had a great run the past couple of years, and many argue that the popular cryptocurrency has replaced gold as the best way to protect your portfolio from downside in the stock market. Unfortunately, market price action so far in 2022 has demonstrated that the price of Bitcoin is highly correlated to other risk assets, including stock prices. In fact, Bitcoin prices are down 26.4% so far in 2022, more than doubling the declines of the S&P 500. Related Link: What Happened To Stock Prices The Last Time Wheat Broke Above $10? A Warning To Investors There are plenty of reasons for investors to be seeking a safe haven for their cash these days, given the Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising interest rates this week, inflation is at a 40-year high and Russia's invasion of Ukraine has disrupted supply chains and raised geopolitical uncertainty. While the invasion rattled the stock market, gold prices have remained remarkably solid in recent weeks since the invasion began. Correlation And Diversification: Diversification is the most powerful tool for any investor to help reduce risk in a portfolio. To maximize diversification, investors need to identify market sectors and assets that have minimal correlation to each other. When you have a portfolio of assets that are highly correlated, a market sell-off will likely drag down your entire portfolio all at once. However, if your assets have a low or even negative correlation, a stock market sell-off or a drop in one single market sector, such as the tech sector or energy sector, might not tank your entire portfolio. Benzinga's Take: Gold has historically had a very low correlation with stock prices, making it a great way to protect your portfolio from a stock market sell-off. For investors looking for an effective inflation hedge that can hold up amid a broad stock market sell-off, gold may still be the best option in today's market."
2022-04-14,"If You're Not Buying Gold, Consider These Five Gold Stocks","Investors already know that gold is a very interesting market when the tide gets tough. As they turn to derivatives such as futures and CFDs, buying shares of companies in the sector is an option worth weighing. In times of recession or economic crisis, investors tend to take money out of the stock market and take refuge in safe-haven assets such as the precious metal. During the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the price reached an all-time high of over $2,000 per ounce in August 2020, surpassing its previous record from 2011. Here are some gold stocks that are also very attractive, ones that could yield more earnings than investing in gold itself, according to a MarketBeat report. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) The Canadian giant expects to produce nearly 4.5 million ounces every year through 2030. After recently thrashing earnings expectations and setting a $1 billion stock buyback, Barrick raised its dividend from 9 to 10 cents. The company’s net earnings hit $726 million —41 cents a share— from $685 million or —39 cents— year-on-year. Revenue jumped about 1% to $3.31 billion, beating estimates for $3.2 billion. CEO John Thornton said, “After careful consideration of our capital allocation, the Board has settled on a new dividend policy of a base dividend with an additional performance dividend linked to the net cash on the balance sheet starting in 2022.” VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) An ETF is one of the best ways to diversify at fewer costs, among them the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF. It offers access to some of the juiciest gold stocks in the market with less than $45 a share as of March 29, 2022. VanEck’s ETF holds positions in the likes of Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold, Franco Nevada Corp (TSE:FNV), Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM), and Gold Fields Limited (JSE:GFI). With an expense ratio of 0.5%, the ETF recovered from a low of $29 to $40, and estimates are pinning much hope on $45 by the end of the year. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) One of the biggest gold companies in the business, Newmont’s dividend yield hit 2.82% declaring $0.55 per share of common stock for the fourth quarter of 2021 —payable on March 24 this year. The firm also smashed earnings estimates with Q4 2021 EPS of 78 cents, and revenue coming in at $3.39 billion surpassing expectations by $13.58 million. Jefferies analyst Christopher LaFemina also raised the firm’s target on NEM from $67 to $72, while Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) also raised its price target from $70 to $75 with a “buy” rating. B2Gold Corp (TSE:BTO) The gold producer operates three big mines, Mali, Namibia, and the Philippines, and has a dividend yield of 3.5%. Last year, the company produced almost one million ounces of gold at an all-in cost of $888 —one of the industry’s lowest, which makes it an attractive option. In 2022, the company is expected to produce between 990,000 to 1.05 million ounces at an all-in cost of production ranging from $1,010 and $1,050 an ounce. This year’s Q1 earnings report said that the Company's total gold production for 2021 was an annual record of 1,047,414 ounces, near the upper-end of its revised guidance range of between 1,015,000 – 1,055,000 ounces, and exceeding the upper end of its original guidance range. Gold Fields Limited (JSE:GFI) Gold Fields Limited has resources in several regions such as South Africa, Ghana, West Africa, Australia, and Peru. The company has an annual gold production of 2.2 million ounces, attributable gold-equivalent mineral reserves of 52.1 Moz, and mineral resources of 116 Moz, according to its website. Last year, dividend yield hit 2.7% and revenue grew by about 8% to $4.2 billion from $3.9 billion. It also saw net income of $789 million —a 9% increase year-on-year. Further, JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) analysts raised the price target from $13.80 to $15.50 and slapped an “overweight” rating on the company. Also, according to Tip Ranks, RBC Capital has a buy rating on the stock, with a target of $12."
2022-04-18,This Gold ETF Is Breaking Out,"If inflation continues to be a problem, the price of gold should move higher. And if it does, shares of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) could skyrocket. When a stock or ETF trades at a higher price than where it had previously hit resistance, traders call it a breakout. This can be a bullish dynamic. Resistance is a large concentration of sellers who are trying to sell their shares at, or close to, the same price. When stocks reach resistance levels, they tend to stop going higher. As you can see on the following chart, this is what happened when GDX reached $39.75 last May. Now GDX is trading above this important level; The resistance has broken. This means the sellers who created it have finished or canceled their orders. With this supply off of the market, buyers will be forced to pay higher prices to bring sellers back off the sidelines. This forces shares into a new uptrend and that could be the case here.

The gold miners sector recently enjoyed a long bull-cycle, which lasted from Jan. 28 to April 18 of this year and caused NUGT to soar 102% higher during that timeframe. Since late April, NUGT has erased all of its gains, however, plunging 54% from its 52-week high of $82.86. NUGT is a double leveraged fund that is designed to outperform the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. The ETF tracks a number of gold and silver mining companies through its four holdings, with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and the U.S. Dollar making up 91.27% of its weighted holdings. The other two funds making up the remainder of NUGT’s weightings are Goldman Sachs Trust Financial Square Treasury Instruments Fund Institutional, weighted at 8.49% and Dreyfus Government Cash Management Funds Institutional, with a 0.23% weighting. It should be noted that leveraged ETFs are meant to be used as a trading vehicle as opposed to a long-term investment by experienced traders. Leveraged ETF’s should never be used by an investor with a buy and hold strategy or those who have low risk appetites. Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial. The NUGT Chart: On Friday and Monday, NUGT was trading sideways within Thursday’s trading range, which has settled the ETF into a double inside bar pattern on the daily chart. The pattern leans bearish in this case because NUGT was trading low before forming the pattern, but traders can watch for a break up or down from Thursday’s mother bar on higher-than-average volume to gauge future direction. NUGT is also trading in a confirmed downtrend, with the most recent lower high printed on June 16 at $44.24 and the most recent lower low formed at the $37.68 mark on Thursday. If NUGT breaks bearishly from the inside bar pattern, the downtrend will continue, but if the ETF breaks bullishly from the formation, the downtrend will be negated and a reversal to the upside could be in the cards. A bounce to the upside is likely to come over the next few trading days because NUGT has developed bullish divergence on the daily chart. Bullish divergence occurs when a stock makes a series of lower lows but its relative strength index (RSI) makes a series of higher lows. For the divergence to correct, NUGT will either need to trade higher or plummet low enough to drop the RSI below 30%. For traders looking to play a leveraged gold miners ETF bear, Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:DUST) is an option. NUGT has resistance above at $41.31 and $44.32 and support below at $37.68 and $33. See Also: Best Gold Stocks Right Now • Updated Daily"
2022-07-07,BZ Chart Of The Day: Is It Finally Time To Buy Gold?,"Gold is oversold and at support. That means it may be time to buy the commodity. The downtrend that started in March may be over. The term oversold refers to a security’s momentum. This is a measure of how far it has moved in a given time. If it gets sold aggressively and pushed below its typical range, traders say it’s oversold. This is important because markets that are oversold tend to reverse and rebound. Support is a large concentration of investors who are looking to buy close to the same price. There is so much demand at support levels that when selloffs reach them, they tend to pause or even end. As you can see on the following chart, gold may have found support again around the $1,725 per ounce level. It’s also oversold. The stage may be set for a move higher.

2022-07-22,Is Gold About To Turn Bullish? A Look At Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull (NUGT),"Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:NUGT) shot up over 6% higher after the market opened, but the move higher was hampered by the general market, which saw the S&P 500 falling about 0.7%. The gold miners sector recently enjoyed a long bull-cycle, which lasted from Jan. 28 to April 18 of this year and caused NUGT to soar 102% higher during that timeframe. Since late April, NUGT has erased all of its gains, however, plunging 63% from its 52-week high of $82.86.

The NUGT Chart: Despite falling to trade mostly flat intraday on Friday, when NUGT reached its high-of-day, the ETF confirmed it's now trading in an uptrend by printing a higher high above the July 18 high of $31.52. On July 20, NUGT printed a higher low above the July 14 52-week low of $28.13, which negated the downtrend. NUGT is trading in a rising channel pattern between two parallel trendlines. The pattern is considered to be bullish unless the ETF breaks down from the lower ascending trendline on higher-than-average volume. Unfortunately, the rising channel paired with the steep downtrend that occurred between June 3 and July 14 may have settled NUGT into a bear flag pattern. If the bear flag pattern is recognized, traders may choose to take a position in the leveraged gold miners ETF bear, Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 2X Shares (NYSE:DUST). NUGT is trading below the eight-day and 21-day exponential moving averages (EMAs), with the eight-day EMA trending below the 21-day, both of which are bearish indicators. The ETF is also trading under the 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages, which indicates gold is currently in a bear market. NUGT has resistance above at $33 and $37.68 and support below at $28.13 and $24.15. See Also: Eliminating Buy And Hold Myths"
2022-08-09,Gold Seeing Bullish Momentum,"On the daily price chart, it’s clear that gold topped out in March at $192 — using the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) as a proxy for gold price — and that a low of $158 came on July 21. Since then, the metal is seeing bullish momentum as it lifts up off of the lows and blasts it way back up to the $167 level before a bit of selling came in early August. The downtrend line that connects the March peak with the April high was hit last week at $167. Enough selling at this line caused a halt in the bounce into August from the July low. A close or two above that red-dotted downtrend line — maybe this week— would confirm that bullish momentum is being seen. Take a look at the weekly chart for gold: What’s revealing about looking at the weekly price chart is the way the metal clearly tested support and then bounced upward. The support line connecting the May/June 2020 lows with the March/April 2021 lows is clear. Gold tested it last week and then found buyers. It will be key for the price to remain above that line for any kind of bullish momentum to continue. So far, so good. For the record, here’s how it looks on the monthly chart: The red-dotted line that connects the late 2008 low down near 70 with the late 2015 low and then the mid-to-late 2018 low – it’s an uptrend. From this long-term viewpoint, the price of gold has been steadily bullish for years despite occasional ups and downs. Here’s an old-school point and figure chart: The benefit of viewing this type of chart is how clearly it shows the $158 level must hold for bullish gains to continue. A break below that key price support area would be a problem for those holding gold. Gold stocks followed along with the benchmark VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), peaking in early April at just above $41 and then descending along with the price of the metal to a low of $24.4 in late July. This gold stock chart is now showing a few positive divergences among basic price indicators: Note that the downtrend line that connected the April peak with the June high has been crossed on the upside by late July. The more bullish look has continued into the month of August. Also, those positive divergences are now showing up on the relative strength indicator (RSI) and the moving average convergence/divergence (MACD), both seen below the price chart. It’s not guaranteed that gold price action and gold stock action will continue to look better. The most recent non-farm payrolls report will have an effect on interest rates and on general market action. Precious metals investors will want to keep a close eye on the price movement for the rest of August – but the last week or two may hold promise. Looking for ways to boost your returns?

2022-08-15,"Analyst Cuts Price Targets For These Gold Stocks, Names Agnico Eagle Top Pick","Second-quarter earnings season was mostly bad news for North American precious metal miners. Several producers lowered their guidance for the second half of the year, and Bank of America analyst Lawson Winder lowered his price target for a handful of gold and silver miners on Monday. Updated Targets: Winder made the following changes to gold and silver stocks under his coverage: Centerra Gold Inc. (NYSE:CGAU), reiterated Underperform rating, price target cut from $6.30 to $5.60. Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE:PAAS), reiterated Buy rating, price target cut from $25 to $22. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), reiterated Buy rating, price target cut from $27.25 to $27. Related Link: An ETF To Protect Your Portfolio? Goldman Sachs Has a Product For You Bank of America projects gold prices will average $1,938 per ounce in 2022 and $2,049/oz in 2023. The firm is projecting silver prices of $21.04/oz in 2022 and $19.51/oz in 2022. Winder said stagflation could push gold and prices even higher than his current projections. Top Pick: He named Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM) his top stock pick in the precious metal mining group. AEM is a stand-out with unchanged 2022 production and cost guidance (unlike many peers), is delivering well on Kirkland Lake merger synergies, and a focus on increasing reserve life by way of exploration, Winder said. Related Link: If You Invested $1,000 In The GLD Gold ETF At Its Pandemic Low, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Gold has likely been a disappointment for most investors in 2022 up to this point. Despite inflation at multi-decade highs, the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) is down 2.7% year-to-date. Benzinga's Take: Gold certainly hasn't been the classic inflation hedge investors have been looking for in 2022. In fact, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) has even underperformed the S&P 500 as a whole year-to-date, falling 16.6%."
2022-09-12,"Gold Stocks, Bitcoin Crushed Despite Inflation Hedge Argument: Goldman Sachs Now Says Buy This Miner","Gold and Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) have proven neither holds the title of being a hedge against inflation this year. Gold equities, gold (the commodity) and Bitcoin have all suffered sharp declines over the past months. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) has declined 37% off its April 18 52-week high of $41.61, spot gold is down 16% from its March 8 all-time high of $2,075.14 and Bitcoin has plunged about 67% since reaching an all-time high of $69,000 on Nov. 10. 2021. Despite the steep drops and ahead of key inflation data expected to come out from the U.S. Labor Department on Tuesday morning, Goldman Sachs sees an upside for Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM). The company has “underappreciated exploration value” following its merger with Kirkland Lake Gold earlier this year, according to the analyst. The Agnico Analyst: Emily Chieng initiated coverage of Agnico with a Buy rating and a price target of CA$72 ($55.45). The new price target suggests 24% upside for the stock. The Agnico Thesis: The company added three mines to its portfolio through its recent merger: the Macassa, Detour Lake and Fosterville mines, which give Agnico “significant synergies,” Chieng said in the note. “The company has targeted $0.9 billion of synergies over the coming five years, and a total of $2 billion of synergies over the coming 10 years,” the analyst said. “While corporate synergies are already approaching the top end of the company’s own expectations, we believe there exists upside to operational synergy (sharing of infrastructure, procurement and warehousing efficiencies, operational improvements) and strategic opportunities,” she added. Chieng sees further upside based on Agnico’s potential for production growth from the company’s “largest ever exploration budget,” which it launched over the past two years. In addition to Agnico’s exploration at properties formerly solely owned by Kirkland Lake, its deposits at the Odyssey Project, Hope Bay and Upper Beaver offer “significant exploration potential,” the analyst said. The analyst also believes Agnico’s “multiple contraction is overdone” and that it “may have reflected uncertainty around the company’s production growth potential following the merger.” Although Chieng expects Agnico’s annual growth rate to slow because of the merger, she sees “the company’s strong track record for exploration and development success as reflective of upside potential.” See Also: Best Gold Stocks Right Now • Updated Daily The Market Landscape: In late 2021, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s tone turned drastically more hawkish when it decided to double its taper of monthly bond purchases on Dec. 15. This year, in an attempt to fight soaring inflation, the Fed implemented a series of rate hikes, with a March raise of 0.5%. In June and July, the Fed doubled down on its policy and issued two 0.75% hikes back-to-back. Despite consumer price index (CPI) data for the month of July showing inflation may have peaked, Powell’s comments at the Jackson Hole Symposium last month indicated the Fed may not be ready to slow its policy, and that another 0.75% rate hike could be on the table when it meets on Sept. 15 and 16. The Fed, traders and investors will be watching for CPI data for the month of August to be released on Tuesday morning. When compared to the data for the month of July, it should become more apparent whether inflation has continued to decrease or whether July’s numbers were a blip. The information will guide the Fed’s policy decision later this week but the market will likely begin to price in the expectation of the percentage at which the Fed will raise its benchmark rate when the market opens Tuesday. The Gold Outlook: Spot gold has held up stronger than gold equities historically, but the last big bull run in gold and gold-related stocks, which took place during the first quarter, set the entire sector soaring with equities enjoying a slightly longer surge. Since then, spot gold and gold equities have been trading in fairly consistent downtrends on larger time frames (the weekly and monthly charts). On the daily chart, however, both spot gold and GDX began trading in uptrends on Sept. 1, which may indicate larger reversals to the upside are on the horizon. The Bitcoin Chart: Bitcoin negated its daily downtrend on Sept. 9 and on Monday the crypto regained the 50-day simple moving average as support, which may indicate longer-term sentiment is turning bullish.

2022-09-26,How The FOMC Announcement Affected Precious Metal Prices,"Precious metals stocks and precious metals reacted positively to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s announcement that interest rates will by 0.75%. Because this sector is traditionally considered an inflation hedge — although not so much lately — the slightly upward move may be a little surprising. Taking rates higher is designed to stop inflationary trends. The daily price chart of the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) looked like this at the close Wednesday: The bullish engulfing candlestick — where the price goes lower than the previous day and then closes higher — is said to be a good sign. The relative strength indicator (RSI) and the moving average convergence/divergence indicator (MACD) in below the price chart are forming positive divergences to price. SPDR Gold shares closed up 0.46%. iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV) closed up 1.86%, outperforming gold and with improved trading volume. Although it’s probably early to say that the price of silver has bottomed, it’s clear that both the RSI and the MACD are showing positive divergences to recent price lows — a good sign, according to standard technical analysis. The VanEck Sector Gold Miners Exchange Traded Fund (NYSE:GDX), a diversified collection of gold stocks, closed higher by 0.34% Wednesday. While it’s not much higher, it’s not down after Powell’s anti-inflationary rate hike remarks. Although the MACD indicator suggests the potential for a bottom, the RSI is not quite there yet to confirm it. Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM) is the largest precious metals operation traded on the New York Stock Exchange and closely followed as a bellwether for the sector. The stock closed lower by 0.93% Wednesday, tamping down whatever bullishness might have been evident in the sector. Note that Newmont managed to remain above the late August/early September lows and that both the RSI and MACD indicators are in positive divergence mode. Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) is the other large mining company widely followed by the precious metals crowd. Barrick closed higher by 0.86%, a different kind of look than Newmont’s close after Powell’s announcements. This precious metals stock has a chart showing positive divergences on both the relative strength indicator and with the moving average convergence/divergence indicator. October’s consumer price index and producer price index readings might be the next catalyst for this sector. Expectations about those inflation readings will affect gold and silver stocks until then.

Eric Robertsen, the bank's Global Head of Research, forecasted numerous possibilities for 2023, including Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC), the world's largest cryptocurrency, falling to as low as $5,000 next year, along with the impeachment of President Joe Biden, among other unexpected shocks. The forecasts are part of Standard Chartered's annual list of surprises that experts feel markets are ignoring or under-pricing. Robertsen expects yields to fall along with tech stocks. “Yields plunge along with technology shares, and while the Bitcoin sell-off decelerates, the damage has been done,” Robertsen wrote in a note to investors Sunday. According to the analyst, a drop in tech stocks in 2023 might result in a wave of bankruptcies, similar to the wave of crypto firms that defaulted following the collapse of Three Arrows Capital this year, including FTX.

The annual list is now in its eighth edition, however it should be emphasized that it is not designed to foresee events with a high probability, but rather to analyze circumstances with a non-zero chance of happening that are not yet part of market consensus. Robertsen also stated that in the surprise situation of crypto crashing, he sees gold skyrocketing - he believes the precious metal can reach $2,250 per ounce (currently $1,778.20).

2023-03-17,"Gold Rallies Eyeing $2,000/oz As Recession Looms – These 3 ETFs To Gain From Precious Metal's Bull Wave","Gold has had a textbook rally following the tumultuous week in the U.S. banking sector and heavy drops in Fed hike expectations as recession risks loom. On Friday, gold surged 2% beyond $1,950/oz levels, putting it on track for a 6% weekly gain, its largest since early November 2022. The precious metal is regarded as the premier safe haven asset in this current market climate since it does not carry any default concerns, has continuously maintained its value through periods of persistent inflation, and generally climbs during times of economic slowdown and recession. Next: 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' Author Says You Should Invest In These Two Assets Amid Silicon Valley Bank's Collapse Gold is very sensitive to rate movements because higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of investing in non-yielding assets like gold, and vice versa. A weaker dollar, lower Treasury yields, and a collapse in expectations for the Fed's rate hikes are all contributing to gold's bullish momentum. Fed swaps now price in a 19 basis point hike in March, with the terminal rate forecast to reach 4.9% in May and then fall from there. Overall, there are three 25-basis-point rate cuts priced until December 2023. Short-term two-year Treasury yields fell by more than 40 basis points this week, the largest drop since October 1987's Black Monday. Gold technical analysis: Bull flag pattern in place Gold price daily timeframe – Chart: TradingView Gold prices broke through a multi-resistance zone this week, which included the 50-day moving average, the psychological $1,900/oz level, and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the high-to-low range from 2022. After the breakout of the flag channel, we can observe the emergence of a bullish flag pattern on the price chart, which may presage an extension of the current rally. The next resistance level is between 1,975 and 1,980, which corresponds to the 2023 price high as well as the 78.6% Fibonacci level. Breaking through this barrier will boost the bull's momentum and improve the chances of an assault on the psychological 2,000 mark. 3 Gold ETFs to Watch: GLD, GDX, GDXJ SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and Junior Gold Miners VanEck Vectors ETF (NYSE:GDX) GDXJ are three ETFs to watch for investors looking to profit on gold's rally. 1) GLD SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) is an exchange-traded fund managed by World Gold Trust Services, LLC that invests in gold bullions and is linked to physical gold performance. As a result, its price moves in lockstep with the commodity, and it does not pay dividends. GLD saw its highest weekly net inflow in almost a year in the week ended March 16, totalling $709.5 million. GLD price chart and weekly ETF flows – Chart: Koyfin 2) GDX The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in the stocks of companies in the gold mining industry. It tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index's performance through a complete replication. Dividends are paid once a year, and the current dividend yield is 1.6%. GDX's major holdings include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:EAM). In the week ending March 16, GDX received $52 million in weekly net inflows, after around $240 million in outflows the previous week. GDX price chart and weekly ETF flows – Chart: Koyfin 3) GDXJ The VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE:GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in stocks of companies involved in the gold mining industry. Differently from GDX, the majority of these companies are still in the development and exploratory phases and are seeking for land with a high potential for significant mineral deposits. Junior gold miners are thus more volatile than already productive gold miners, which is why GDXJ has a greater volatility than GDX. GDXJ's top holdings include Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC), Yamana Gold Inc. (NYSE:AUY), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI), and Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE:PAAS).

2023-04-05,Digging For Discounts: Gold Mining Stocks Offer 30% Bargain—Is It An Unmissable Buying Opportunity?,"Gold mining companies have returned to the forefront of the market as gold prices break decisively above $2,000 per troy ounce and are projected to approach their all-time highs. Investors ponder if gold mining businesses have already capitalized from the recent gains in the price of the precious metal, or whether they are instead selling at a discount. By plotting the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) in relation to the price of gold, it seems that gold miners are trading relatively cheap with respect to what the bullion prices would suggest. Assuming a perfect or nearly perfect correlation with gold prices, as it has been for much of the past decade, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF would have traded about 30% higher than current levels. When gold prices surged above $2,000/oz last year in March 2022 and in August 2020, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF traded above $40 per share, or at least 25% higher than today's price. Why Are Gold Miners So Cheap To Gold? The reason why gold miners performed somewhat poorly in comparison to commodity prices was because the industry's major players—Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corp. (NYSE:FNV), and Agnico Eagles Mines Ltd. (NYSE:AEM)—rose far less than other smaller names in the industry. Stocks with less than 1% weight in the GDX portfolio, such as Equinox Gold Corp. (NYSEAM:EQX), up 70%, Dundee Precious Metals Ltd. (OTCPK: DPMLF), up 58%, and Torex Gold Resources (OTCPK: TORXF), up 45%, have produced the biggest year-to-date gains in the gold mining industry. In essence, if the bottom of the sector has soared in response to gold increases, the heavyweights have yet to jump on gold's bullish bandwagon. GDX Best-Performing Holdings Year-to-Date Company Weight (%) YTD Return (%) Equinox Gold Corp. 0.69 69.82 Dundee Precious Metals Inc. 0.58 58.31 Torex Gold Resources Inc. 0.58 45.02 GDX Top Holdings and Their Performance Year-to-Date Company Weight (%) YTD Return (%) Newmont Corporation 10.40 10.59 Barrick Gold Corporation 8.82 15.21 Franco-Nevada Corporation 7.57 13.03 Agnico Eagle Mines Limited 7.25 8.12 Newmont Corp: Analyst Price Targets Might Be Raised Shortly The present median analyst price target for Newmont stands at $56.00, a relatively conservative figure when considering the implications of current gold prices. Wall Street analysts have traditionally adjusted Newmont's price target with some lag compared to gold price fluctuations. Should gold prices continue to sustain at current levels or even increase, it's reasonable to anticipate upward revisions for Newmont's and other gold mining giants' price targets in the coming weeks or months. This trend could potentially yield a positive impact on mining stock prices. Read next: Peter Schiff Once Asked Bitcoin 'Fanatics' To Stop Making Fun Of Gold: 'Don't Be The Last One Onboard'"
2023-04-13,VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) Skyrockets To 11-Month Highs: A Stunning 25% YTD Surge As Precious Metals Dazzle,"The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), an exchange traded fund that invests in equities of firms operating in the metals and mining, gold, and silver sectors, has risen to levels last seen in early May 2022, driven by big gains in precious metals commodities. After rising more than 25% in 2023, gold miners are currently the best-performing industry year-to-date, surpassing the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH). Backed by fundamentals: Gold prices surged to $2,040/oz on Thursday, approaching fresh 2023 highs as falling producer inflation and increasing jobless claims fueled market speculation about the Fed's rate hiking cycle nearing an end. Gold prices have risen 12% so far in 2023. Silver also rallied to $25.83/oz, a price last seen a year ago, and has risen nearly 25% in the past month alone. Five Gold Miners To Watch: The strongest contributors in the previous month to the GDX's performance were Gold Fields Limited (NYSE:GFI) up 53%, Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. (NYSE:AEM) up 24.3%, AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (NYSE:AU) up 47%, Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD) up 18%, and Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM) up 13%.

As the figure below indicates, historically, there has been an almost perfect link between gold prices and the GDX, which somehow weakened last year. GDX was trading above $40 per share when gold prices were at this level in July 2020. This correlation might imply that gold miners still have room for gains if gold prices holds these levels or potentially rise further.

2023-05-04,What's Moving Gold Mining Stocks Today? GDX ETF Hits Yearly Highs As Bullion Sets New Record,"Gold mining stocks soared on Thursday, significantly outperforming the broader U.S. stock market which is projected to slump for a third consecutive day. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) posted a daily 2.5% gain to $35.75 per share, hitting the highest in over a year, in the session when gold prices briefly touched fresh all-time highs of $2,081/oz. Chart: VanEck Gold Miners ETF Climbs To 1-Year High Major Gold Mining Companies That Contributed to The VanEck Gold Miners ETF's Excellent Performance on Thursday: Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM), rising 3.9% and contributing 0.37 percentage points to the GDX's overall daily performance. Agnico Eagles Ltd. (NYSE:AEM), rising 4% and contributing 0.30 percentage points to the fund's performance. AngloGold Ashant Ltd. (NYSE:AU), rising 5.3% and contributing 0.24 percentage points to the fund's performance. Gold Fields Ltd. (NYSE:GFI), rising 3.8% and contributing 0.22 percentage points to the fund's performance. Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD), up by 2% and contributing 0.18 percentage points to the fund's performance. GDX's Latest Funds Flows According to Koyfin statistics, the VanEck Gold Miners ETF has received $18 million in inflows so far this week, switching from $158 million of outflows the previous week. Strong inflows into GDX were observed in March during the weeks when the US regional banking system was under stress as a result of the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Capital. So far this year, GDX has seen outflows totaling $200 million. First-Quarter Earnings Reports Last week, Newmont reported a $0.40 EPS in Q1 2023, above expectations of $0.33. Revenues were lower than predicted ($2.679 billion versus $2.745 billion). On May 3, Barrick Gold announced a $0.141 EPS in Q1 2023, above expectations of $0.112. Revenues were also stronger than expected ($2.66 billion versus $2.581 billion). On May 2, Franco Nevada Corp. (NYSE:FNV) announced lower than expected EPS ($0.79 vs $0.80) and revenues ($276 million vs $293 million). Last week, Agnico Eagles surprised analysts' estimates by reporting both a stronger than expected EPS ($0.582 vs $0.471) and revenues ($1.514 billion vs $1.481 billion).

Thursday’s unexpected surge in unemployment claims, sparked fears about a weakening labor market and triggered positive reactions for gold and silver mining companies. According to the latest CME Group Fed Watch tool, investors have placed their bets on the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates unchanged next week, assigning a nearly 75% probability. Both the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields fell for the session, while precious metals rose, as the risk of an additional hike faded, at least for now.

2023-07-03,Gold Miners Trading At Bargain Price To Gold: Is GDX The Buy Opportunity For The Remainder Of 2023?,"Gold prices, as tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), closed the first half of 2023 with a shy performance of 5%, significantly underperforming the equity asset class, with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) up by 16% and with the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) up by a staggering 38%. But while prices of the precious metal are only 7% off their all-time highs, steep price discounts are clearly visible among gold mining stocks. The VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is trading one-third lower than its highs in 2020 and 54% lower than its all-time highs in 2011, attracting the attention of value hunters. By simply correlating the price of gold (GLD) to that of the Gold Miners ETF (GDX), the latter should be trading at least 30% higher than current levels when looking at a 5-year timeframe. Does this present a buy opportunity for investors to enter an undervalued sector before its recovery, or is it a potential value trap waiting to unfold? North American Gold Miners Offer Attractive Valuations When analyzing the U.S.-listed large-cap gold miners included in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF, they stood out with highly appealing valuations according to common stock metrics, including price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, price-to-book (P/B) ratios, and price-to-median analyst price target spreads. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), one of the largest gold producers globally and is headquartered in Colorado, trades at 15 times its projected 12-month earnings, showing one of the lowest forward P/E ratio of its history. Compared to the median analyst price target ($59), NEM currently trades at $43.1 per share, effectively implying a 38% discount. Another industry giant with a similar forward P/E to Newmont is Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD), which is trading at a 30% discount to the median analyst price target. Barrick Gold also screens price-to-book value of 1.3x, which is one of the lowest for the North American market. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM), a Canadian-diversified gold mining company operating across Canada, Finland, and Mexico, is trading at a 22x forward P/E ratio, well below its 5-year average of 38.9x. When looking at the median analyst price target ($65), AEM current market prices ($50) imply a 30% discount.

2023-07-13,Cash In On The Crashing Dollar: 5 Stocks And ETFs Ready To Soar From The Greenback's Downfall,"The U.S. dollar index (DXY), as tracked by the Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund ETF (NYSE:UUP), dropped below the key 100 mark on Thursday, plunging to its weakest levels since April 2022, as softer-than-expected consumer and producer inflation encouraged traders to scale back bets of more than one rate hike by the Federal Reserve this year. Consumer price inflation fell to 3% year on year in June, the slowest rate since March 2021, a full percentage point lower than in May and well below the predicted 3.1%. In June, producer inflation fell to a negligible 0.1% year-on-year, the lowest reading since August 2020 and considerably below the predicted 0.4%. The dollar came under pressure following a steep decline in U.S. Treasury yields, with the policy-sensitive two-year Note yield falling 20 basis points to 4.66% in the previous two sessions. The value of the dollar, as gauged by the DXY index, has dropped 4% since the beginning of the year and 13% from its all-time high reached in September 2022. The dollar has suffered even greater losses versus emerging-market currencies, such as the Mexican peso (MXN) and the Chilean peso (CLP), which are up 20% and 18%, respectively, since their lows in 2022. Chart: US Dollar Index Falls To 15-Month Lows Dollar Weakens: What Are The Effects? For U.S. exporters: Products made in the U.S. become more competitive on international markets when the dollar weakens. As a result, American exporters may see an increase in demand and sales, potentially improving their profits. For multinational corporations: Multinational corporations headquartered in the U.S. typically get a sizable amount of their revenue from outside of the country. A weaker dollar can improve the value of these earnings when they are repatriated (converted back to U.S. currency). For emerging markets: A weaker dollar might make it less expensive for emerging-market countries to repay or service their debt in U.S. dollars, which makes a high portion of their overall debt. It also encourages investors to seek higher returns in emerging markets, leading to increased capital inflows and potentially boosting these economies. For inflation and purchasing power: It’s important to note that a weaker dollar can have also downsides, such as potential inflationary pressures and decreased purchasing power for U.S. consumers and companies importing foreign goods.

2023-07-24,Unlocking Gold Mining's Supercycle: Insights From Benzinga's Virtual Conference,"In the latest virtual conference presented by Benzinga, three outstanding experts and industry professionals gathered to explore the prospects of a new “Supercycle” for gold miners. Delving into crucial factors affecting the performance of gold mining stocks, they discussed Fed interest rates, market valuations, geopolitics, ESG and technological innovation in the industry. In the first part, Imaru Casanova, a portfolio manager for Gold and Precious Metals at VanEck, highlighted the potential bullish catalysts for gold miners and presented her top stock recommendations. Taylor McKenna, CFA and an analyst at Kopernik Global Investors, emphasized the value of gold mining stocks and discussed the application of AI technologies. Luke Norman, co-founder and executive chairman at US Gold Corp. (NYSE:USAU), offered insights into the gold mining exploration side and the permitting cycle. VanEck Sees Attractive Valuations In The Gold Mining Industry VanEck’s Casanova expressed optimism about the outlook for gold miners, citing the end of the Fed tightening cycle as a potential bullish catalyst. With strong global support in the current environment, gold miners are poised to demonstrate their leverage with higher gold prices. Casanova highlighted the historically low multiples at which gold mining stocks are currently trading, coupled with controlled balance sheet costs, generate an attractive investment opportunity. “When gold traded at these levels (around $1,970) in the past, stocks in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) or VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) index were trading 15-20% higher,” Casanova said. Regarding top stock recommendations, Casanova identified Endeavor Mining PLC (OTCPK: EDVMF), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI), and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM). She emphasized that VanEck’s current price forecast for gold is $2,075 per ounce in the next 12 months, which offers a compelling case for diversification and growth in the gold mining sector. Read Also: Agnico Eagle Mines’ Debt Overview Kopernik Global Investors Is Bullish On Smaller Miners Kopernik Global Investors’ McKenna expressed strong conviction in gold mining, pointing out the attractive valuations the sector offers. McKenna discussed the opportunity in smaller companies within the industry such as Seabridge Gold Inc. (NYSE:SA), International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. (NYSE:THM), and Western Copper and Gold Corp. (NYSE:WRN), which trade at even cheaper valuations than big miners but carry higher risk. Among the majors he highlighted is Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) offers attractive valuations as it shows an all-in-sustaining cost (AISC) of $1,400 an ounce, positioning the company for significant potential if gold prices continue to rise. McKenna also stressed the importance of scrutinizing management teams and incentives, and he shared insights into how AI technologies, such as driverless trucks for mining, are being employed to boost productivity and reduce environmental impact. US Gold Corp’s Vision for the Greenest Mine in North America US Gold Corp.’s Norman shed light on the gold mining exploration and permitting cycle. He emphasized that smaller companies involved in gold exploration often become investment vehicles for larger corporations in the sector. Norman provided an overview of US Gold Corp.’s primary project, the CK Gold project, and its location just outside Cheyenne, Wyoming. “Navigating the permitting process in North America can be challenging, with federal agencies causing bottlenecks,” Norman said. Norman did highlight the advantage of working with the state of Wyoming, which has set a mandate for a more streamlined permitting timeline. Despite trading at a significant market discount due to perceived permitting challenges, US Gold Corp. has 1.5 million ounces of reserves in the ground, and its all-in-sustaining costs are projected at $800 per ounce. Norman believed the in-situ value of reserves in the ground should place U.S. Gold Corp’s market cap to about $300 million, while the company is currently trading at about $40 million market cap. Norman highlighted how ESG became a hugely important factor in the business and he aspired to develop the greenest mine in North America.

2023-08-30,Forget Stocks And Bonds - Here's Why Gold Is The Best Investment Right Now,"You might think bonds or T-bills look intriguing right now, with some offering nearly 5% back guaranteed. Or maybe you’ve been looking at Walt Disney Co’s (NYSE:DIS) stock, down 25% in the last year. But, according to DataTrek co-founder Nick Colas, it's time to bypass bonds and struggling stocks; gold is the investment to focus on. Colas points out that despite the fact that gold has underperformed the S&P 500 in the United States, it has held up better than most global stocks and equities. Colas also points out that demand for gold comes from different sources, including central banks wanting to bolster their balance sheets. Also Read: Is Cathie Wood The Next Warren Buffett? Apple, Tesla Define Their Investment Strategies Colas argues that because of an increase in demand for gold from central banks throughout the world, gold prices should steadily increase. Colas says that any increase in global geopolitical tensions could help push gold prices even higher. “Now, if you think we're going to have an outbreak of global peace, then gold is probably not a great trade, because central banks will see much less interest and not want to own as much gold,” Colas said in a recent YouTube video and blog post. “However, the current situation feels quite different. We have geopolitical tensions with Russia, with China. Turkey has its own issues.” How To Trade Gold: If you want to go long gold but don’t want to go out and buy physical gold, there are plenty of ETFs and other funds available on U.S. markets that provide solid gold exposure. Here are five gold ETFs that could be good options for longing the precious metal: SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) SPDR Gold MiniShares Trust (NYSE:GLDM) iShares Gold Trust (NYSE:IAU) VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) Goldman Sachs Physical Gold ETF (BATS:AAAU) Now Read: Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF Ruling Shifts Sands Of Crypto Regulation: 3 Analysts Weigh In Photo: Shutterstock"

This will mark the first month of losses after a consecutive 5-month winning streak for both the SPY and the QQQ.

2023-09-07,"Three Ways I Use RSI To Analyze Trends, And Why Alphabet Is Still In A Clear Bullish Phase","Novice investors usually go on a “Holy Grail quest” early on, reading books and watching videos and searching for that elusive one indicator to rule them all. After 23 years of analyzing the markets using technical analysis, I will tell you one thing for sure… There is no Holy Grail. What I will also tell you is that there are a number of technical indicators that do a very good job of helping the astute investor to analyze trends, quantify investor sentiment, and anticipate inflection points in price. One of my favorite indicators to do all of the above is the Relative Strength Index or RSI. Created by Welles Wilder and promoted in his classic text, New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems (featured in our Recommended Reading List!), the RSI has become my go-to oscillator to better understand price dynamics. Today I’ll show three ways that I use the RSI to identify short-term price swings, determine trend phases, and anticipate market turns. Overbought Vs. Oversold Conditions When I was first introduced to technical indicators, I was kindly asked (that is, forced) to prove out the calculations to about 20 indicators in Excel. The idea was that by understanding the math behind each indicator, I could better understand how it was using inputs of price and/or volume and how the output could be used to anticipate turning points. Wilder originally designed RSI for the commodity markets, and for him it was all about mean reversion. In other words, the goal was to buy low and sell high, and RSI was a tool to try and optimize those entry and exit points. The chart of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) has plenty of examples of where overbought conditions were followed by short-term drops, and oversold conditions usually happen right before a bounce higher. To be clear, the real signal is not when the indicator enters the overbought/oversold region, but rather where it exits that extreme condition. Buy signals in February, May, and August 2023 all worked quite well, as gold stocks bounced higher in each instance. Sell signals in January and April 2023 also worked out, with price pulling back in both cases. Sometimes, those extreme readings become a little more complex, and we need to add divergences to our technical analysis arsenal. The Dreaded Bearish Divergence It makes sense that when a stock is an uptrend, the RSI will tend to get to the overbought region. Price is going higher, driven by stronger upside momentum, so an overbought condition should be expected. So when the price continues higher not on stronger momentum but weaker momentum, that’s when we may need to take action. Notice how Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) made higher highs every month from January to July? Now focus on the highs in late June and mid-July. The price of AAPL continued to grind higher, but the RSI actually sloped lower. This pattern of higher prices and lower momentum is called a bearish momentum divergence and usually indicates a bullish phase that is “running out of gas”. In other words, the end of the trend is near! We noticed bearish divergences on key growth stocks back in July, which meant the subsequent drop in August was a likely next step for the markets. But how can we relate short-term RSI signals to long-term trends? This is where Connie Brown’s work completely changed how I use the Relative Strength Index. Using RSI to Determine Trend Phases The earlier example using gold stocks provided a decent illustration of overbought and oversold conditions. But sometimes the RSI never gets to an extreme reading. Does that mean the indicator is broken? No, it means the price is trending. In Connie Brown’s groundbreaking book, Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional (another book featured in our Recommended Reading List!), she explains how the range shown by the RSI over time can tell you about the overall trend structure. When a chart is in a confirmed downtrend of lower highs and lower lows, the RSI often becomes oversold on the downswings. But the countertrend moves back to the upside usually stall out with an RSI around 60. You’ll see the opposite in an uptrend, where the RSI often becomes overbought on a move higher but rarely breaks below 40 on pullbacks. Here's that same chart of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) but with the phases indicated with a shaded RSI. Through the end of 2022, Alphabet was in a clear downtrend phase. The fact the RSI never really broke above 60 on upswings tells us that while we are seeing some countertrend bounces, the overall trend remains bearish. Note how the pattern changes in January 2023, with the RSI pushing up to 70 on a rally. This was an early indication that something had changed and that the overall downtrend phase was evolving into a new uptrend phase. As long as GOOGL becomes overbought on upswings, and the RSI remains above 40 on pullbacks, the RSI is telling us that the overall trend remains bullish. I’ve found the Relative Strength Index to be an effective way of anticipating turning points, recognizing trend shifts, and confirming market phases. By applying indicators like RSI in a consistent and disciplined manner, an astute investor can use price momentum to better identify entry and exit points in any market environment.

2023-10-05,"An Oversold Gold Miner With Strong Fundamentals--Its Relative Strength Index Is Below 20, And Its Piotroski F-Score Is 8","Paying Attention To Gold Miners On Zero Hedge on Monday, contributing editor “Quoth The Raven” suggested “paying urgent attention to gold miners”: As everybody knows, one of my favorite assets on the board right now for buying is gold miners. They are completely hated and totally undervalued, without even a semblance of pricing in the potential leverage they could gain from a spike in gold prices. Basically, gold, as tracked by the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE:GLD), hasn’t done as well as goldbugs might have expected in an inflationary environment, because rising rates have boosted the dollar, and gold miners, as tracked by the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) have lagged gold. But if you believe the Fed will have to start cutting rates at some point next year, presumably, gold will go up. And when that happens, gold miners will likely go up even more, thanks to their operational leverage, which can turn a double digit increase in the price of gold into a triple digit increase in gold miners’ profits. An Oversold Gold Miner In a recent post, we looked at the power of the technical indicator RSI (Relative Strength Index). A technical indicator to keep in mind for earnings trades. https://t.co/g6zISKkVmc$BIG $SFIX — Portfolio Armor (@PortfolioArmor) September 25, 2023 RSI is a number from 0 to 100 indicating how overbought or oversold a security is. Values over 70 are usually considered overbought, and values below 30 are usually considered oversold. One screen I’ve been looking at recently includes both RSI and the Piotroski F-Score, which is a measure of financial strength on a scale from 0-9, with 9 being best. I run a bearish version of that where I look for stocks with an RSI over 80 and a Piotroski F-Score of 2 or lower, and I run a bullish one where I look for an RSI under 20 and an F-Score of 8 or better. As it happens, a gold miner comes up on this screen, one with an F-Score of 8 and an RSI below 20. Digging Deeper As with all mechanical screens, it’s best to do some further investigation, to eliminate false positives. For example, one of the stocks the bearish version of this screen picks up now is Reata Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:RETA) where the RSI looks high because the company was just acquired by Biogen, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB). In the case of our gold miner, I found a deep dive on it by an analyst who highlighted a few key facts about it. On the positive side, it has some of the highest margins in the industry, reporting all-in sustaining costs of about $700 per ounce, compared to an estimated industry average about $1,360 per ounce in the period. On the negative side, one of the company’s properties is in a state in Mexico that has some political risk (a history of strikes). Because of that, this analyst wrote he’d want a discount of 35% to his estimate of the miner’s fair value before investing. The stock is trading at a slightly bigger discount to his fair value estimate now, and by using options, we can potentially get it at an even bigger discount. We have a trade teed up to do just that.

2023-10-05,5 ETFs To Monitor When September Jobs Data Is Revealed On Friday,"The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the highly-anticipated September jobs report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Among the data investors will scrutinize are the non-farm payrolls (NFPs), which serve as an indicator of the rate of new job creation during the month. This data point, along with inflation, holds significant sway over the Federal Reserve’s decision-making process on interest rates. Investors are anticipating a decline in NFPs from 187,000 in August to 170,000 in September. Such a figure would represent a softening from the prevailing trend of monthly new job additions, which has averaged 194,000 over the past six months and 257,000 over the course of the past year. In addition to the NFPs, investors will be closely monitoring the unemployment rate, which is expected to decrease from 3.8% to 3.7%, and the year-on-year increase in hourly wages, forecasted to remain stable at 4.3%. Read Also: How The ‘January Effect’ Could Spark Tech Stock Renaissance In October, Q4 How The Jobs Report Influences Markets The employment market report holds the power to exert a profound influence on markets. Should the NFPs surpass expectations and hourly wages demonstrate a stable or higher-than-expected uptick, concerns about further interest rate hikes may escalate. Conversely, a more pronounced cooling in the labor market could lead market participants to anticipate that the Federal Reserve will maintain its current stance, at least until the upcoming meeting. As it stands, market-implied probabilities assign an 80% likelihood to the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates unchanged at the Nov. 1 meeting, according to CME Group Inc.‘s (NYSE:CME) FedWatch Tool. Following the release of the September NFPs data, the following five ETFs could experience pronounced volatility: Invesco DB USD Index Bullish Fund (NYSE:UUP): The U.S. dollar is highly sensitive to jobs data. A stronger-than-expected monthly employment growth is bullish for the dollar, as it solidifies the Federal Reserve’s commitment to higher interest rates, leaving room for potential rate increases. Conversely, a weaker jobs report is negative for the dollar, as it may suggest no further rate hikes. In the wake of the last stronger-than-expected jobs report, the dollar rose by 0.7% for the day. iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond (NASDAQ:TLT): TLT is one of the most closely watched ETFs due to its high volatility in response to the recent ascent in Treasury yields. If the NFPs exceed expectations, it could exert additional upward pressure on Treasury yields, thus generating further headwinds for TLT. The last higher-than-expected NFP report in August (187,000 vs. 170,000) saw the TLT ETF drop by 1.9% in a single session. Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ): Technology stocks are highly sensitive to Federal Reserve rate expectations, and as witnessed recently, rising Treasury yields have had a detrimental impact on the performance of the Nasdaq 100. Bulls of QQQ are hoping for a weaker-than-expected NFPs report. Invesco Solar ETF (NYSE:TAN): The solar sector has experienced a significant selloff over the past month, suffering losses exceeding 20%. This slump has been driven by a stagnant real estate market, with 30-year mortgage rates exceeding 7.3%, and the adverse effects of rising Treasury yields. A softer-than-expected September jobs report would be a boon for the solar industry, while a strong NFPs reading could exacerbate the downturn. VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX): Another sector that has been severely impacted by rising Treasury yields is that of gold miners. Over the past two weeks, GDX has experienced a 12% decline, as gold prices dipped to $1,810 per ounce due to the robust U.S. dollar and 10-year yields exceeding 4.70%. If the NFPs fail to meet expectations, gold could benefit, potentially leading to a decline in Treasury yields. The last stronger-than-expected NFP reading resulted in a 0.6% decline in the GDX ETF on the same day.

2023-10-17,Peter Schiff Foresees A 'Trifecta Of Doom' — Gold Bug Warns Of Entrenched Inflation And Loss Of Confidence In The US Economy,"Acclaimed economist Peter Schiff warned Tuesday about the potential impact of a rise in bond yields, oil, and gold. He referred to this as a “trifecta of doom,” indicating an entrenched inflation and dwindling confidence in the Federal Reserve and the U.S.’s fiscal solvency. #Bond yields, #oil, and #gold all look poised to rip higher. This trifecta of doom is a warning to investors of entrenched #inflation and a loss of confidence in the #Fed and fiscal solvency of the U.S. The next shoe to drop should be the dollar. The #StockMarket may be the last.— Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 17, 2023 What Happened: “This trifecta of doom is a warning to investors of entrenched #inflation and a loss of confidence in the #Fed and fiscal solvency of the U.S.,” Schiff tweeted. He further cautioned that the dollar could be the next to fall and that the stock market might be the last to react. On the same day, Schiff noted that Gold had shrugged off the day’s spike in bond yields to close nearly $3 higher. He noted that Gold mining stocks performed well on Tuesday with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) rising over 1.8%. “Maybe [gold traders] are finally realizing that while higher [inflation] is bearish for bonds, it’s very bullish for gold.” Gold shrugged off today's spike in #bond yields, to close about $3 higher on the day. Gold mining stocks were even stronger, with the $GDX rising over 1.8%. Maybe #gold traders are finally realizing that while higher #inflation is bearish for bonds, it's very bullish for gold.— Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) October 17, 2023 See Also: September Retail Sales Top Expectations As Consumers Defy High Inflation, Interest Rates Why It Matters: It should be noted that Spot Gold rose 0.1% to $1,921.86 per ounce as traders watched the ongoing Israe-Hamas conflict and looked out for the upcoming rate hikes. Gold COMEX December 2023 futures were up 0.27% at $1,940.90. The precious metal is typically considered a safe haven investment. Schiff’s comments echo his previous warnings about the state of the U.S. economy. In early October, Schiff criticized interpretations of core CPI data, claiming it misrepresented the real concept of inflation. He linked inflation to excessive demand caused by an increase in money and credit supply and feared that rising public and private debts could exacerbate inflation. In a previous tweet Schiff, Schiff expressed his doubts about the effectiveness of the Inflation Reduction Act and the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes in stabilizing price levels.

2023-10-18,Gold Miners Positioned For Upswing: Keep An Eye On This Leading Economic Indicator,"A fundamental gauge in the world of finance and economics has just provided a signal not to be underestimated. We are talking about the gold-to-copper ratio, which can offer valuable insights into the overall health of the global economy and financial markets. This ratio represents the strength of a safe-haven asset, such as gold, which tends to rise during periods of market and economic turmoil, in comparison to copper, often considered a barometer for industrial production and seen as the driving force behind global economic growth. In practice, it indicates how many pounds of copper one ounce of gold can purchase. As highlighted by SentimenTrader on social media platform X, the “copper-to-gold ratio has recently crossed a crucial threshold, signaling positive prospects for metals and mining.” When examining the chart, this indicator surpassed the value of 544 on Wednesday, reaching its highest level since the end of May 2023. The ratio is now approaching a significant resistance zone, marked by a triple-top pattern that occurred in December 2020, July 2022, and May 2023. Why Is Gold Rising? The conflict in the Middle East has so far benefited two commodities: gold and oil. While the increase in oil prices is primarily due to rising geopolitical and supply risks in the region, what has garnered more attention in recent weeks is the surge in gold prices. This is because not only has the price of gold risen by 6% since Hamas carried out terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, but it has also done so while Treasury yields and the dollar were on the rise, breaking its usual negative correlation with these variables. According to Otavio Costa, a partner and macro strategist at Crescat Capital, gold appears to be on a path toward reaching $2,000 per ounce again, indicating the potential for a significant breakout that could mark the beginning of another long-term cycle. Costa referenced a statement made by Ray Dalio: “If you don’t own gold, you know neither history nor economics.” Gold approaching $2,000/oz again, now poised for a historical break out that could mark the beginning of another long-term cycle.Ray Dalio put it succinctly:If you don't own gold, you know neither history nor economics pic.twitter.com/FZSBCo7FZm— Otavio (Tavi) Costa (@TaviCosta) October 18, 2023 Gold Miners Outperformed Gold miners have emerged as the top-performing industry in October.

Harmony Gold Mining Company Ltd (NYSE:HMY) has been the top performer among junior gold miners, up 29% this month.
