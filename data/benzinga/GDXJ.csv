2010-03-18,Is The SPDR Gold ETF The Reason Behind The Massive Rally In Gold?,"“Clusterstock’s Chart of the Day makes the case that gold ETFs like the massive SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) have helped push prices higher in recent years by letting speculators bet on the precious metal. This “trigger-finger investor base” could exacerbate a crash when the momentum fades, the argument goes,” John Spence Reports From MarketWatch. Spence goes on to say, “With more than $40 billion in assets, GLD is the second-largest U.S.-listed ETF behind SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Huge inflows and the rise in gold prices have resulted in the fund’s assets more than doubling from $18 billion in September 2008, according to J.P. Morgan. The ETF holds more gold than many sovereign nations have stashed in their reserves.” “ETFs have allowed speculative buyers to rapidly move in and out of the asset, which has changed the nature of the investor base driving the metal’s marginal price,” Business Insider writes. “See, the gold buyers of the past didn’t have the hair-trigger trading capability of the present ETF group, and there was a time when gold was considered simply a store of value rather than a vehicle for making huge upside,” it adds. “Which is why some research firms have voiced concern about gold’s suspected dependency on fund flows for price support.” We have listed some options for investing in gold through ETFs below: LONG: The investment (GLD) seeks to replicate the performance, net of expenses, of the price of gold bullion. The trust holds gold, and is expected to issue baskets in exchange for deposits of gold, and to distribute gold in connection with redemption of baskets. The gold held by the trust will only be sold on an as-needed basis to pay trust expenses, in the event the trust terminates and liquidates its assets, or as otherwise required by law or regulation. The investment (GDX) seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the AMEX Gold Miners index. The fund generally normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in common stocks and American depositary receipts (ADRs) of companies involved in the gold mining industry. The fund is nondiversified. The Funds (GDXJ) investment objective is to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners Index (the “Junior Gold Miners Index”). For a further description of the Junior Gold Miners Index, see “Junior Gold Miners Index.” The objective of (SGOL) the newly listed shares is to reflect the performance of the price of Gold bullion, less the Trust’s operating expenses. The Trust is open ended and is designed for investors who want a cost-effective(1) and convenient(2) way to invest in Gold as well as diversify their Gold holdings. The investment (UGL) will seek to replicate, net of expenses, twice the performance of gold bullion as measured by the U.S. Dollar p.m. fixing price for delivery in London. The fund normally invests assets in financial instruments with economic characteristics twice the return of the index. It may employ leveraged investment techniques in seeking its investment objective. The investment (DGL) seeks to track the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is a rules-based index composed of futures contracts on gold and is intended to reflect the performance of gold. The investment (DGP) seeks to replicate, net of expenses, twice the daily performance of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is intended to reflect changes in the market value of certain gold futures contracts and is comprised of a single unfunded gold futures contract. The objective (IAU) of the trust is for the value of its shares to reflect, at any given time, the price of gold owned by the trust at that time, less the trust’s expenses and liabilities. The trust is not actively managed. It receives gold deposited with it in exchange for the creation of baskets of iShares, sells gold as necessary to cover the trust’s liabilities, and delivers gold in exchange for baskets of iShares surrendered to it for redemption. The trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. SHORT: The investment (DZZ) seeks to replicate, net of expenses, twice the inverse of the daily performance of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is intended to reflect changes in the market value of certain gold futures contracts and is comprised of a single unfunded gold futures contract.

2010-03-19,PLTM and CU: New First Trust ETFs Not Physically Backed,"First Trust launched two new ETFs on March 12: First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (PLTM) and First Trust ISE Global Copper Index Fund (CU). Their names sound like they are commodity ETFs, and perhaps even physically-backed commodity ETFs. However, they are equity funds that invest in stocks. First Trust probably should have added “producers,” “miners,” or “equity” to the names to avoid confusion. First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (PLTM) is based on an equity index called the ISE Global Platinum Index, which is designed to track public companies active in platinum-group metals mining based on revenue analysis. Platinum group metals include platinum, palladium, osmium, iridium, ruthenium, and rhodium. PLTM holds 25 stocks. The largest are MMC Norilsk Nickel JSC ADR 7.9%, Johnson Matthey Plc 6.9%, Eastern Platinum Ltd. 6.8%, Aquarius Platinum Ltd. 6.8%, Lonmin Plc 6.6%, Impala Platinum Holdings Limited 6.5%, Anglo Platinum Limited 6.1%, and Stillwater Mining Company 6.0%. Top country exposure includes Canada 24.4%, South Africa 22.2%, United Kingdom 17.2%, Australia 15.6%, Russia 7.8%, and United States 6.1%. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.70%. Additional information can be found in the PLTM summary and other resources in the PLTM documentation list. First Trust ISE Global Copper Index Fund (CU) is based on an equity index called the ISE Global Copper Index, which is designed to track public companies active in the copper mining industry based on revenue derived from the sale of copper. CU holds 27 stocks, the largest being BHP Billiton Ltd 6.8%, Xstrata Plc 6.8%, Antofagasta Plc 6.7%, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc. (Class B) 6.5%, Southern Copper Corporation 6.2%, and MMC Norilsk Nickel JSC ADR 5.0%. Top country exposure includes Canada 42.3%, United Kingdom 27.1%, United States 13.0%, Australia 6.8%, Russia 5.0%, and Peru 3.0%. Although Chile produces about a third of the world’s copper, its major players are not publicly traded. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.70%, and additional information can be found in the CU summary and other resources in the CU documentation list. With the introduction of PLTM and CU, investors now have the ability to invest in platinum and copper producers in much the way that Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) provide access to gold producers. Whether or not there is investor demand for indexed products covering non-gold metal-specific mining companies remains to be seen.

2010-03-22,Increased Global Demand Will Support The Price Of Gold ETFs,"“Gold prices over the past week have been teetering in positive, negative and somewhat uncertain territory. But there is confidence that the price of bullion will increase this year. One factor that is likely to support the price of the precious metal is the fact that central banks around the world have been hoarding the commodity and are reluctant to sell it. In fact, some bullion analysts expect the central banks of China, Russia and India to continue to gobble up gold as they move away from sovereign bonds and seek safer investments,” Kevin Grewal Reports From The Street. Grewal goes on to say, “A second factor likely to support the price of the yellow metal is the expected increase in global demand for base metals. There is an indirect correlation between the two types of metals, and in general as the prices of base metals increase so do those of gold. Thirdly, investor appetite for safe-haven tools is expected to continue to rise as sovereign debt issues in Europe, particularly Greece, continue to make headlines and remain a concern.” “Lastly, the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates at or near zero is likely to result in a loss of purchasing power, which could result in the U.S. dollar declining and make gold appealing to foreign investors and painting a macroeconomic backdrop which may support gold’s price,” Grewal Reports. We put together a list of some Gold ETFs to play if you believe in Golds increased global demand below: LONG: The investment (GLD) seeks to replicate the performance, net of expenses, of the price of gold bullion.

2010-03-25,Does Investing In The Platinum ETF Make More Sense Than A Gold ETF?,"“Gold might have history on its side, but when it comes to investing in precious metals platinum arguably makes more sense. Platinum is rarer, dearer and just as pretty. What’s more, unlike gold, it has an important industrial use in automotive catalytic converters and LCD TV screens. If that weren’t enough to recommend the white metal, the launch of new exchange-traded funds makes platinum easier than ever to buy and sell,” Christopher Helman Reports From Forbes. Helman goes on to say, “How does platinum compare to gold as an investment? It tends to trail its yellow sister when times are bad but outperform when industrial demand recovers. That’s been the case in the past three months, as platinum prices have outpaced gold’s by roughly 10 percentage points. These days, an ounce of platinum at $1,600 buys roughly 1.4 ounces of gold. That’s more than the average of 1.2 ounces last year, according to Bloomberg. Back in May 2008, an ounce of platinum bought 2.4 ounces of gold” “The ETF Securities Physical Platinum Shares (PPLT) fund is similar to the popular gold bullion SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) in that it buys and holds raw bullion (safeguarded by JP Morgan Chase (JPM)). Its shares track platinum’s spot price. You’ll incur lower transaction and storage fees in holding the ETF (annual expenses: 0.6%) than in holding and storing your own bullion bars,” Helman Reports. See more details to Helman’s story: HERE Platinum does have some appeal to it for different reasons but, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF is the second biggest ETF in the world for a reason.

2010-03-26,Further Political Disruptions Around The World Will Push Gold ETF Prices Higher,"“One of my favorite areas to invest in to protect my profits and reduce my portfolio risk is an ETF that invests in gold. SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) has advanced 150% during the past five years compared to an advance of just 1% for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. And during the ugly bear market from October 9, 2007, until March 9, 2009, GLD was up 23.9% compared to the -56.8% drubbing that the S&P 500 took,” Roy Ward Reports From The Iconoclast Investor. Ward goes on to say, “Gold Shares provide investors with a convenient way to invest in gold. The shares trade on the NYSE and may be bought and sold like any other securities. I believe further political disruptions around the world will push gold prices higher in 2010 and 2011. Also, inflation will likely begin to rise within the next 12 months, which will also push gold prices higher. If the economy falters once again, investors will sell common stocks and invest in gold.” “Gold bullion increased from a low of 800 to almost 1,200 per ounce during 2009, but has now declined to 1,107 per ounce. The resulting lower price of GLD shares presents an outstanding investment opportunity. The purchase of (GLD) will counteract the volatility of common stocks and will guard against a possible fall in bond prices,” Ward Reports.

2010-03-28,"ETF Investors Will Look To Buy Gold And Tech As The Next Market Correction Nears (GLD, QQQQ, SPY, GDX)","I’m going to start off with a few breadth charts. The NYSE new highs – new lows chart is now on a sell signal as both the slow and fast average have rolled over and are accelerating downward. Everything continues to point to an impending correction. The change in character the last two days is also suggestive that something is different. Instead of opening lower and rising through the day, the market has been gapping up but closing lower. This is a complete about face from what has been happening over the last two months. I will be monitoring sentiment as the market moves down into the correction. If investors get scared and panic quickly then this should be a short correction. If we were to get a sharp selloff this is what I would expect to happen. I’m talking 50+ S&P 500 points in 3 or 4 days. If, however, investors have gotten locked into a buy the dip mentality it could slow the rate of decline and we might be looking at something lasting closer to 10 or more days. I will say that what usually happens after one of these extreme momentum moves is that everyone heads for the door at the same time. The correction tends to be scary but over quickly as everyone panics all at once. That’s what happened in February 2007 during the mini crash following the runaway move. The market gave back four months of gains in 8 days. Now I don’t think we are going to give back 4 months of gains (this is only a daily cycle low not an intermediate cycle low), but I do think we could quickly fill the March 5th gap, which would be a 60 point loss. If that happened in 5 or 6 days it should be enough to swing the bullish sentiment all the way back to the extreme negative side of the boat. The market desperately needs to reset sentiment by going through another mini profit taking period and the sharper the correction, the better. I’ve warned many times that the intermediate correction separating the second and third leg of the bull was only going to be a profit taking correction that would soon be recovered. However, and as expected, while we were going through the last correction I had multiple traders inform me that this was the onset of another deflationary collapse. Heck, I’m still seeing articles on the internet predicting another deflationary collapse any day now. Often these predictions of disaster are associated with some imaginary trend line dating back to the 1970’s or 1980’s. I’ve even seen one site that based their predictions of an impending bear market on a trend line originating in the 30’s. I have to ask, how many people from the 1930’s are still trading stocks and are there enough of them to really effect the markets? I have no earthly idea why a trend line starting back in the depression should have any significance at all to today’s market. Geez, some of the crazy stuff one sees in this business. It’s enough to make you wonder if common sense is dead. I must say after watching both the tech and real estate bubbles expand and listening to the irrational reasons analysts gave at the time for why they weren’t bubbles, I have to think common sense is becoming a rare commodity in this day and age. I’m going to let you in on a secret. Bull markets don’t end because of lines on a chart or Fibonacci retracements or anything technical related for that matter. Bull markets end when a fundamental shift occurs. They end when something breaks. In a secular bear market like we have been in since 2000 that fundamental shift almost invariably leads to a severe bear leg down in stocks and the onset of a recession…or worse. We saw the first leg of the secular bear begin in 2000 as the world realized tech stocks were ridiculously overpriced, along with Greenspan’s monetary policies spiking the price of oil. The end result was a severe bear market and a recession. We saw this again more recently as the credit and real estate bubbles burst. This was then exacerbated by Bernanke’s insane monetary response which, of course, did nothing to stop either one of those bubbles from bursting. All Bernanke’s monetary response did was spike the price of oil to $150 and made sure we would have a very severe recession. This is still a cyclical bull though and until we have a catalyst in place to kill it there is one game plan that should be followed. That game plan is one that everyone who has the slightest experience in the market should already know. In bull markets you BUY DIPs. And you continue buying dips until you see a fundamental change occur that is going to send us down into the next recession. So once we enter the correction (it may have started with last Thursday’s key reversal) we want to be buyers of that dip. (I’m going to outline a game plan in a minute). First off, let me state again that I seriously doubt the next leg down in the secular bear is going to come from a deflationary front. We’ve already gone down that road. Bernanke proved he can defeat deflation with his printing press. Heck, he proved he could abort a left translated four year cycle with the power of the printing press. I’m constantly getting into debates with traders pushing the deflation scenario. The fact remains that we had the worst deflationary period in 80 years and Bernanke halted it in 9 months. Bernanke halted deflation the same way Roosevelt halted deflation in the 30’s by debasing the currency. I can assure you that if the slightest hint of deflation reappears, Ben will crank up the presses again. So I just don’t see deflation as the catalyst for the end of this cyclical bull. The catalyst for the death of any bull market almost always comes from the area that is experiencing excesses. In 2000 the catalyst emerged when the tech sector cracked. Everyone had become convinced these companies were eventually going to make unimaginable amounts of money, while amazingly enough overlooking the fact that most of them were making no money and never really had any reasonable shot at ever making any money. They were just burning through capital and at an incredible rate. Once the world woke up and realized the emperor had no clothes, down we went. This collapse was exacerbated by Greenspan’s printing efforts to ward of the imagined 2000 contagion and had the unintended consequence of spiking the price of oil. The latest catalyst as I mentioned above came when the overheated real estate and credit markets imploded. So we have to ask ourselves, where is the excess this time? It certainly isn’t tech. The companies that are left are making money. It’s not the real estate markets. That bubble has already popped. And I don’t believe it is going to pop again. I doubt it’s going to come from the credit markets again, as people and banks are deleveraging now, and for years to come. Besides central banks have already figured out they can fix those problems by changing the accounting laws and by pumping liquidity. So where is the dam going to spring a leak from this time? What is the area that is experiencing massive excesses that will eventually come back to haunt us? I would say there are two. One of them is government debt. But I’m not sure that will cause problems though because governments control the printing presses. No matter how much debt they rack up they can always print enough additional money to pay it. That leads us to the heart of where I think the next catalyst is going to emerge. The one area of incredible excess is the currency markets. Let’s face it, every country in the world has been running the presses on overdrive since early 2008. This has created an ocean of liquidity covering the globe like no other time in history. It halted the deflationary spiral we were in last year. And it is certainly giving the illusion that good times are returning (heavy emphasis on illusion). But just like the credit bubble felt real nice while it was growing, there are going to be consequences for this excessive liquidity. The piper will eventually have to be paid. I expect it will start when a small or maybe even a medium sized country’s currency gets into trouble. Then, just as subprime infected the rest of the mortgage market, it will spread into other currencies. I strongly suspect the bull market will end when something breaks in the currency markets. So until we see that happen investors should continue to buy dips and ignore all the Chicken Little’s predicting the sky is falling because we are approaching a trend line from 1932 or because this is the third of a third wave or whatever hokey nonsense they imagine will start the next bear phase. As I have said, bear markets begin when the fundamentals break down, not when the technicals do. The Game Plan: Now with that in mind, and allowing that nothing in the currency markets has broken …yet, we need to plan for how we should proceed. At the moment traders should be mostly in cash as we await the correction into the daily cycle low. Once we get the inevitable correction we have a couple of options. One, we can invest heavily back into the miners on the assumption that gold’s A-wave has started. That will certainly be an option, but one with a very big condition attached to it. Gold must break below the February low. If gold doesn’t break below the February low of $1044 I think that option will come off the table. The reason being that the intermediate gold cycle is going to be short as we go into this stock market correction. Usually this cycle will last about 20-25 weeks. If the cycle bottoms next week or the week after that it would put the intermediate cycle at 14/15 weeks. Now it’s not unusual for gold to have a short cycle from time to time but if gold hasn’t made a lower low then we will be facing the distinct possibility that we are going to get another bounce that fails to make a higher high followed by a final move to lower lows that bottoms in the normal timing band. The other possibility would be that February did mark the D-wave bottom and gold is now in a very tricky A-wave advance. This is a possibility but one that is going to be very difficult to game as we won’t really have confirmation unless gold breaks above $1161. And by that time the rally will probably be mostly over as A-waves rarely make new highs. So while I know gold bugs will jump on a higher low as proof gold has bottomed, cyclically it would be much better if gold makes a lower low as that would have much higher odds of marking a true intermediate cycle low and probably the end of the D-wave. It would also be a huge plus if the COT report shows a 90+ Blees rating. (The Blees rating is simply a measure of how bullish or bearish commercial traders are compared to the last 18 months and available to subscribers in the weekend reports). That’s not going to happen with gold above $1050. The next thing I want to call attention to is Bernanke’s goal. It has always been his intent to inflate asset prices. And he’s certainly succeeded so far. Now let me state clearly that I’m not a believer in the whole gold manipulation conspiracy theory nonsense. If gold were really being manipulated successfully then explain to me how in the world it’s managed to rise from $250 to over $1200 an ounce. What I will concede is that the powers that be would probably prefer that gold didn’t rise. $1200 gold kind of makes a mockery of their phony CPI and PPI numbers. Now that doesn’t mean they can do anything about rising gold. A secular bull market is a secular bull market and nothing anyone does is going to stop that from running its course. What it does mean is that they are certainly not going to do anything to expedite the process. What the powers that be do want is for the stock market to rise. So I think we have to admit that if there is anything the government can do to help that process along they will, or at the very minimum they will certainly not do anything to hinder that from occurring. So the second investment option when we get close to the bottom of the impending daily cycle would be to just buy the market (probably tech as it’s been outperforming and will likely continue to do so). If the government wants the market going up then the lowest risk play would be to just take them at their word and go along for the ride. Buying the QQQQ’s (QQQQ) or the SPYDER’s (SPY) would be, by far, the safest play if gold has not made a lower low and even if gold has made a new low it would still be the safest bet, although probably not the most profitable as an A-wave advance in gold should send mining stocks rocketing higher and would likely double the percentage gains possible in the CUBE’s or SPYDER’s. So I will be watching gold as we move down into the stock market cycle low. If gold does not make a lower low like we want, then I think we are going to have to assume that we are going to see another failed rally that is unable to break the pattern of lower highs and that will roll over again. Any positions taken in miners or metals at that point will have to be short term positions. That doesn’t mean those positions won’t rally. Many could rally 15 -20% which would probably be bigger than the stock market but we would have to go into those positions knowing we will be exiting again soon and that the odds are that this is just another deceptive bounce in an ongoing D-wave and not the explosive move of an A-wave rally. If gold does fail to make a lower low I think the safer bet would be just to buy the market. -Written By Toby Connor From Gold Scents Gold Scents is focused primarily on the secular gold bull market. Investors have turned to gold ETFs since the economy has been in uncertain times. They offer a great way to protect you against risk in your portfolio during uncertain times. We have put together some other ETF options for your viewing below: LONG: The investment ETF (GLD) seeks to replicate the performance, net of expenses, of the price of gold bullion. The trust holds gold, and is expected to issue baskets in exchange for deposits of gold, and to distribute gold in connection with redemption of baskets. The gold held by the trust will only be sold on an as-needed basis to pay trust expenses, in the event the trust terminates and liquidates its assets, or as otherwise required by law or regulation. The investment ETF (GDX) seeks to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the AMEX Gold Miners index. The fund generally normally invests at least 80% of its total assets in common stocks and American depositary receipts (ADRs) of companies involved in the gold mining industry. The fund is nondiversified. The Funds ETF (GDXJ) investment objective is to replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners Index (the “Junior Gold Miners Index”). For a further description of the Junior Gold Miners Index, see “Junior Gold Miners Index.” The objective of ETF (SGOL) the newly listed shares is to reflect the performance of the price of Gold bullion, less the Trust’s operating expenses. The Trust is open ended and is designed for investors who want a cost-effective(1) and convenient(2) way to invest in Gold as well as diversify their Gold holdings. The investment ETF (UGL) will seek to replicate, net of expenses, twice the performance of gold bullion as measured by the U.S. Dollar p.m. fixing price for delivery in London. The fund normally invests assets in financial instruments with economic characteristics twice the return of the index. It may employ leveraged investment techniques in seeking its investment objective. The investment ETF (DGL) seeks to track the price and yield performance, before fees and expenses, of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity Index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is a rules-based index composed of futures contracts on gold and is intended to reflect the performance of gold. The investment ETF (DGP) seeks to replicate, net of expenses, twice the daily performance of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is intended to reflect changes in the market value of certain gold futures contracts and is comprised of a single unfunded gold futures contract. The objective ETF (IAU) of the trust is for the value of its shares to reflect, at any given time, the price of gold owned by the trust at that time, less the trust’s expenses and liabilities. The trust is not actively managed. It receives gold deposited with it in exchange for the creation of baskets of iShares, sells gold as necessary to cover the trust’s liabilities, and delivers gold in exchange for baskets of iShares surrendered to it for redemption. The trust is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or a commodity pool for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act. SHORT: The investment ETF (DZZ) seeks to replicate, net of expenses, twice the inverse of the daily performance of the Deutsche Bank Liquid Commodity index – Optimum Yield Gold Excess Return. The index is intended to reflect changes in the market value of certain gold futures contracts and is comprised of a single unfunded gold futures contract. The investment ETF (GLL) will seek to replicate, net of expenses, twice the inverse daily performance of gold bullion as measured by the U.S. Dollar p.m. fixing price for delivery in London. The fund normally invests assets in financial instruments with economic characteristics inverse to the index. It may employ leveraged investment techniques in seeking its investment objective.

2010-03-29,Continued Bullishness in Gold,"Friday I highlighted bullishness within the gold market and a few trades that would take advantage of continued movement sideways and/or to the upside. Today I am seeing what looks to be a bullish play in the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) as well. I am detecting 10,000 each of the May $26 and $23 puts traded a short while ago within a minute of each other. Both options traded between the bid and ask so it is difficult to say for certain whether it was bought or sold. In addition to that there was a pickup in the volume of the underlying at that time. The action in the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF is more than likely someone getting long the ETF and buying the put spread as a protective hedge. This would allow them to be covered down to $23, where they would once again become long the ETF. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF is currently trading $25.78, up 1.10% on the session."
2010-04-05,"Gold ETF News: After 30% Gain in Past Year, Where Next for Gold?","Jeffrey Nichols, Senior Economic Advisor to Rosland Capital, had the following commentary based on today’s market activity and the week ahead.From its recent low under $1,090 an ounce, gold has recovered lost ground, trading above $1,120 in past days. And while gold prices have appreciated nearly 30 percent from a year ago, gold remains below its all-time high of $1,227 reached in early December. The question of “Where next?” may rest in the following factors: The Euro: Will the Euro regain its lost favor, or will sovereign risk considerations push the European currency still lower against the U.S. dollar? In the recent past, capital flight and currency speculation gave the dollar a boost, and the “appearance” of a stronger dollar has been gold’s chief nemesis ever since Europe’s sovereign risk crisis moved to center stage. Greece’s announced “bail-out” plan in March eased sovereign-risk fears and gave gold some room to recover. But Europe’s currency crisis is far from over. Credit default markets are again signaling rising anxiety, not only over Greek debt but also over the sovereign debt of Portugal, Spain and Italy. In the near term, another run on the Euro could send gold lower. Federal debt: Rising anxiety over America’s huge federal debt (as evidenced by the mixed reception by foreign central banks and institutional investors to U.S. Treasury debt offerings in the past couple of months) is undermining faith in the U.S. dollar and calling into question its future purchasing power. As concerns about the dollar mount, as central banks and foreign investors demand a rising risk premium on U.S. Treasury debt offerings, the effect of Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and uncertainty about the future viability of the continent’s common currency will have a diminishing effect on the dollar – and gold will be free to reflect its inherent value. Global demand: Will strong physical demand from China, India, and other important Asian gold markets continue to underpin the price, set an effective floor beneath the market, and limit downside risks? Physical demand from this region, particularly India and the Middle East, tends to be extremely price sensitive. In recent weeks, however, particularly as gold dipped toward $1,090 an ounce, increased buying from the region (China, India, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Arabian Gulf states), provided strong support and helped push the price back above $1,100. Significant and substantial growth in gold demand from this region pushed by a range of factors will have a very positive effect on the dollar price of gold – something Western investors have come to anticipate. Western investment: Investors are returning to gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after several months of lackluster interest. Bullion held on behalf of the 12 gold ETFs we monitor, rose by 929,373 ounces in March, recording the first monthly gain since last November. In contrast, gold ETFs saw net sales of 825,501 ounces in the first two months of this year. In addition, demand for gold bullion coins has also picked up in recent weeks, indicating that interest in gold from individual “retail” investors is also perking up. As all of these developments coalesce positively for gold, we are still confident in our forecast of $1,500 gold by the end of 2010.

China is doing everything it can to make life tough for investors in Chinese stocks, making the ProShares UltraShort FTSE/Xinhua China ETF (NYSE: FXP) worth watching. The iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) was up nearly 5% on Tuesday. If emerging markets are weak, try a leveraged play in the Direxion Daily Emerging Markets 3x Shares (NYSE: EDZ). The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) surged on Wednesday, gaining almost 7%. Its junior cousin, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) was also up almost 7%.

2010-05-12,Another Way To Play Gold's Ascent,"Fueled by Europe's sovereign debt woes and plunging oil prices, gold has been making fresh 2010 highs, but you probably knew that already. And you probably already knew that popular ETFs like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the ETFS Physical Swiss Gold Shares (NYSE: SGOL) have been making new highs as well. GLD and SGOL are backed by physical gold and that means each of their shares represent ownership in an ounce gold, usually each share equals roughly a tenth of an ounce. That means these ETFs trade with triple digit price tags and those prices can intimidate plenty of investors. Don't worry, there is another way to play rising gold prices and that is the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the small-cap cousin of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). GDXJ made its debut just seven months ago, but has accumulated almost $116 million in assets in that time. The allure of GDXJ lies in the fact every now and then, a small-cap gold mining firm really does make it big. The problem is picking the right one from the herd of small-cap miners that are here today and gone tomorrow. GDXJ focuses on companies with a median market cap of $850 million, so the ETF stays aways from the speculative names without eschewing growth potential. Actually, almost 44% of GDXJ's constituents qualify as mid-cap stocks, but what should be noted is that there the intimate correlation between GDXJ and GLD or GDX that one might expect. GDX is up about 7% in the past six months, while GLD is up 10%. GDXJ trumps both, as it is up 20% since its debut. If $30 emerges as support for GDXJ that may confirm the ETF's breakout and $35 may not be far off.

2010-05-20,A Small-Cap ETF – A Big Idea for Gold Bugs (GDXJ),"The fallout from plunging oil prices and Europe’s sovereign debt crisis has given investors few places to hide. Two asset classes are on the upswing lately: the U.S. Dollar and Gold. Both are seen as safe havens. Yes, they’re bouncing around a lot and are due for a correction. The current pullback could be a good buying opportunity. Today we’ll focus on gold-related investments. Thanks to ETFs, you can participate in gold’s rally without actually owning gold. You’ve probably heard of the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). GLD is backed by physical gold holdings and has become the world’s second-largest ETF by assets, thanks to rising gold prices and huge cash inflows. Several smaller ETFs are also backed by physical gold. There are other ETFs to help investors play positive gold trends that are not reliant on actual gold holdings. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) is the small-cap cousin to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX). The latter focuses on large-cap names. GDXJ is a small-cap ETF that has proven popular with investors since its debut in November 2009, accumulating almost $116 million in assets. That’s an impressive haul in such short time. Some investors still view small-cap gold names in a negative light. This is probably due to those promotional pieces we get by email from unscrupulous hucksters extolling a small-cap miner with no chance of survival, let alone turning a profit. Those are NOT the stocks GDXJ owns. While not huge, New Gold (NGD), Gammon Gold (GRS), Coeur d’Alene Mines (CDE), and other holdings are real companies that are in the business to stay. About 54% of GDXJ’s holdings are considered “small-cap” using the metric of a market cap of $200 million to $1 billion. The ETF balances this with 44% in mid-cap names (stocks with market caps of $1 billion to $5 billion). In addition, GDXJ’s country exposure should give investors some comfort. Nearly two-thirds of the assets are in Canadian companies. Australia and the U.S. also have double-digit allocations. To be sure, many of GDXJ’s holdings could be considered speculative. That’s what makes this ETF a good idea. Select small-cap gold miners can offer big-time rewards. The trick is to own the right names. GDXJ isn’t actively managed, but its index methodology seems to result in a pretty good selection. GDXJ has performed admirably so far in 2010, gaining about 10%, in line with GDX and GLD. GDXJ has outperformed its larger rivals since its debut last November. Of course, any gold-related ETF is sensitive to the daily price swings in the underlying commodity. Bear that in mind if you buy. Nevertheless, GDXJ may be a good alternative for some gold exposure. To go long small-cap and mid-gap gold producers, buy GDXJ. Disclosure covering writer, editor, publisher, and affiliates: Long GLD. No positions in any of the companies or ETF sponsors mentioned. No income, revenue, or other compensation (either directly or indirectly) received from, or on behalf of, any of the companies or ETF sponsors mentioned."
2010-06-02,"Brian Kelly Is Bullish On Gold (GLD, GDXJ)","Brian Kelly commented on CNBC's Fast Money Final Call Iranian decision to convert 45 billion euros in dollars and gold. Brian Kelly believes that Iran's decision to buy gold could be politically and economically motivated. U.S. and other Western countries may start to buy gold as a strategic asset, if Iran and other countries that are hostile to U.S. start to accumulate gold. Iran can't do much alone, but if this becomes a part of some bigger strategy we will see a bubble like elements in gold. If gold becomes the currency of choice than the one who owns the most of it will be the winner. Brian Kelly thinks that it would be wise to have some exposure to gold at this point. He has a long position in SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ).

2010-06-28,Last Week In Review,"Equity markets drifted downward all week and the Congress enacted sweeping financial regulatory reform. Major U.S. markets closed lower for the week. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) closed down by 3.46% and the PowerShares QQQ (Nasdaq: QQQQ), which tracks the NASDAQ 100 Index, fell for the week by 3.68%. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE: DIA) dropped 2.65%. The United States Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) edged lower for the week. Oil was trading around $79.01 a barrel on Friday afternoon. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) was relatively flat on the week. The price of gold was trading at $1,255 an ounce on Friday afternoon. The Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) outperformed other ETFs this week, up about 2.7%. Components of that ETF showing particular strength this week include shares of Tan Range Exploration (AMEX: TRE), up about 7% and shares of Golden Star Resources Limited (AMEX: GSS), up about 7% on the week according to ETFChannel.com. And underperforming other ETFs this week is the Solar Energy ETF (NYSE: KWT), down about 7% this week. Among components of that ETF with the weakest showing for the week were shares of Evergreen Solar (Nasdaq: ESLR), lower by about 13.1%, and shares of Canadian Solar (Nasdaq: CSIQ), lower by about 11.1% on the week. Other ETF standouts this week include the Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), outperforming this week with a 2.7% gain. And the First Trust ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index Fund (NYSE: FCG) was an underperformer, falling about 6.8% this week. FINANCIAL REGULATION AGREEMENT The House and Senate agreed on a financial regulation reform bill on Friday. The bill curbs risk-taking, provides limits on leverage for banks, and offers new consumer protections. Also included was the Volcker rule, named after former Fed chief Paul Volcker, limiting speculative proprietary trading activities. Banks have seven years to comply with many of the new provisions. ECONOMIC NEWS On the economic front, existing home sales for May were released on Tuesday. The National Association of Realtors said May sales dropped to an annual rate of 5.66 million, far below consensus expectations of 6.1 million. Home sales were down 22 percent from the September 2005 peak of 7.25 million. New home sales plunged 33 percent in May from April to the lowest level ever recorded, an annual rate of 300,000 according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Sales fell 18.3 percent compared to a year ago. Observers were expecting a 400,000 annualized sales forecast for May. On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor released initial jobless claims. The result surprised analysts, falling 19,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 457,000 level. This was the lowest level in six weeks, beating expectations of 465,000 initial jobless claims. Also on Thursday, the U.S. Commerce Department said orders for durable goods dropped in May, sinking 1.1 percent on weaker demand for airplanes, steel and communications equipment. This was viewed as mildly positive with consensus expectations for a 1.4 percent decline. EARNINGS On the earnings front, Adobe Systems (Nasdaq: ADBE) reported first quarter profits of 44 cents per share against a consensus estimate of 33 cents. Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) earned 60 cents per share, topping analyst estimates of 54 cents. KB Homes (NYSE: KBH) had disappointing news on Friday, posting a loss of 40 cents per share. The consensus forecast was a loss of 30 cents. Research in Motion (Nasdaq: RIMM) reported earnings per share of $1.38 per share, beating analyst estimates of $1.33. Contributed by: ETFChannel.com"
2010-06-28,"Low Yields, Consumer Confidence, Income Impact 06-28-2010","Cusick’s Corner Volume stayed light and the market stayed range bound into the After Hours. What was interesting to watch is the precipitous fall of bond yields, the 10 yr pulling back to 3.02%, signaling a stronger case for potential deflation. This move into the fixed income arena could be a potential reaction to the G20 spend and deficit reduction efforts that were disclosed after the meeting. This reduction in spend could be a signal of a larger and deeper global economic slowdown. Watch the Case Schiller and the Consumer Confidence numbers due out tomorrow. Consumer Confidence could give us a better idea of incomes, which in turn could give a better picture of potential spending habits. See you Midday. The major averages bounced around a bit, but finished the day little changed Monday. The table was set for modest gains at the opening bell after the G-20 met over the weekend and pledged to reduce deficits and cut debt. European markets finished with modest gains on the news. In the US, the early focus was also on May Personal Incomes and Spending data. The data showed incomes up a less than expected .4 percent, but spending increasing by .2 percent. Economists were looking for a .5 percent gain in incomes and .1 percent increase in spending. With not much else to guide the morning action, the major averages wavered at the open and were showing modest gains into midday. However, with a busy economic calendar ahead, including key jobs data Friday, the tone of trading turned more cautious late. At the closing bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5 points and the NASDAQ had lost 2.8. Bullish Flow Plains Exploration (PXP) was the subject of a bullish “smart money” trade Monday. Shares of the Houston-based oil and gas company lost 73 cents to $20.95 and an investor apparently sold 10,000 November 17.5 puts at $1.30 per contract to buy 10,000 November 22.5 – 28 call spreads at $1.75. The bearish three-way spread, at a 45-cent net debit, is a bullish play because it makes its best profits if shares rally beyond $28 through the November expiration. By selling naked puts, the strategist is also saying that they’re willing to buy the stock at $17.5, even if shares fall below that level through mid-November. Bullish order flow was also seen in Aflac (AFL), Home Depot (HD), and Expedia (EXPE). Bearish Flow GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) sees increasing put volume late Monday. Shares of the British pharmaceutical company lost 31 cents to $34.30 and options volume hit 12.5X the recent average daily, with 13,000 puts and 345 call options traded in the name. July 32.5 puts were the most actives. 5,440 changed hands and 82 percent hit at the asking price, which indicates buying interest. 4130 July 35 puts traded (92 percent Ask) and another 1380 August 32.5 puts (97 percent Ask). Implied volatility rose 7.5 percent to 29 and, while there’s no company specific news to explain the action, it looks like bearish trading or hedging on concerns about the short-term outlook for GSK. Bearish flow also picked up in Dell Computer (DELL), Starbucks (SBUX), and Alkermes (ALKS). Index Trading Options action remains rather slow in the index market and so there’s not much to report. About 260,000 calls and 237,000 puts traded across the S&P 500 Index and other cash indexes, which is only 44 percent of the recent average daily volume for the index market. The top trade of the day was in the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX), which finished up .47 to 29. A block of 4000 VIX October 37.5 calls traded for $3.50 and appeared to be part of a VIX 32.5 – 37.5 call spread, or a bullish bet in anticipation of increasing levels of market volatility during the historically volatile months of September and October. ETF Trading Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) saw more action than usual. This fund holds shares in smaller and medium-sized companies that derive at least 50 percent of their revenues from gold and or silver mining. Shares lost 43 cents to $29.19 and the focus was on the August 36 – November 40 call diagonal spread, with one investor paying 33 cents and 32 cents, a total of 2500X. This spread appears to be a bullish play, or a bet that shares will hold below $36 through the August expiration and then rally from that point forward."
2010-06-29,"Dennis Gartman Explains The Action In Gold (GLD, GDX, GDXJ)","Dennis Gartman said on CNBC's Fast Money that he is bullish on gold. He explained that when stocks decline like they did today, investors start to look for liquidity. This is the reason why gold struggled to make significant gains today. Dennis Gartman added that it is possible for gold to trade higher in the deflationary environment. Gold traded higher in 1930s, and back then U.S. was facing deflation too. Mr. Gartman added that he is not a gold bug, but money has to go somewhere, and gold is a logical choice. He also said that the stock market can't go up when the government is raising tax and making spending cuts. Gold mining stocks are not the best way to own gold, because you don't want to worry about strikes and other troubles that could happen. That is why Dennis Gartman does not recommend Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). The best way to play gold is with SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), thinks Dennis Gartman. GDX and GDXJ fell 2.66% and 4.42% today, while GLD gained 0.15%. See Some of the Top Moving Indexes Here."

2010-09-20,Treasuries Breaks Long Term Trend As Precious Metals Continue To Move Higher,"Since the emergence of the European Debt crisis in April 2010, treasuries have been in a strong uptrend as investors have been seeking protection from risky assets.April to August 2010 was a deflationary period, similar to the fourth quarter of 2008 when treasuries soared higher before the massive government stimulus. Stocks have been in a five month correction. Now, in September 2010, long term treasuries are suffering a correction and break of long term trend support. Long term treasuries are unable to find support at the 50 day moving average. I highlighted a few weeks ago that treasuries appear to be making a top as the Chinese cut back on U.S. debt. The massive efforts from Washington to prevent a double dip appear to be putting a respite in the decline in equity markets. It also appears that The Fed will continue to easy monetarily during this crisis as they meet tomorrow and is expected to accommodate further. The Fed has already stated that they will keep interest rates low well into 2011. This is very bullish for silver and gold. Efforts to deflate the currency have succeeded and now the dollar is challenging new lows and breaking through support. Treasuries have corrected considerably along with the dollar. Although the policy makers in Washington have revived the equity markets, the long term effect on the dollar and long term debt will be detrimental. The markets are at resistance now and are very overbought. I would consider being careful on this rally as a deteriorating currency and high unemployment will put pressure on the consumer. The precious metals long term uptrend is in fact the best place to be during this ongoing debt crisis. Now there is a massive flow to silver and gold. I would not go chasing it now with the masses. There will always be corrections and sales on gold and silver in a bull market as I highlighted to my readers four weeks ago right before the rally. Silver is especially overextended and could have a healthy pullback. There will be sales in the future as profit taking is imminent as it is overextended over its 50 and 200 day moving averages. Subscribe to my free newsletter for trading signals and strategies at http://goldstocktrades.com. It appears that the strategies from the central bank are now reflating the economy as gold, silver and base metals have reached new highs, while the dollar and U.S. treasuries are correcting considerably. I believe the trend of sovereign debt defaults will continue and central banks raising their positions in precious metals. This is the beginning of a major rush into gold and silver We are currently seeing a huge transfer of capital into gold, silver and mining stocks. I believe the best way to invest in emerging markets is to buy gold, silver and base metals that these countries are now importing rather than exporting. I also see the possibility of the equity market, dollar and treasuries decoupling from silver and gold as they have made extremely upside breakouts since our bullish call on precious metals at the end of July. It has made an explosive move and is extended way above support and moving averages so a pullback is inevitable. I am a long term silver bull but at this point would wait for a healthy pullback and secondary buypoints will be alerted to my readers first at http://goldstocktrades.com."
2010-09-27,Protection Purchased on the Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ),"Shares of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are lower on the session by 0.12%, currently trading at $33.72. The ETF has been moving largely higher over the past three months, off of a recent low near $25.00. While the ETF does seem overbought, there are multiple support levels below. Options traders are buying a bit of protection on the ETF today. A short while ago the October $34.00 put was purchased 4,000 times on open interest of 6,277 contracts. Call volume is running at 2.52x the daily average. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF seeks replicating as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners Index.

2010-10-05,"Gold Settles At New Nominal High…Again. (GLD, GDX, UUP)","Gold futures skyrocketed once again today, ending the regular session at $1,340.60 per ounce. The SDPR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), which tracks the price of Gold futures, ended the session higher by 1.97%, trading at $130.99. Much of this movement was due to falling of the U.S. Dollar Index, which fell once again today. The Powershares DB US Dollar Bull Index (NYSE: UUP), which tracks the Dixie, ended the session lower by 0.84%, at $22.56. Interesting to note is that the Gold miners continue to outperform to price of gold futures; the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) ended the session higher by 3.08%, trading at $57.26 and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) ended the session higher by 3.96%, trading at $34.66.

2010-10-12,Goldman's Golden Gold Forecast Should Benefit These ETFs,"Gold and its seemingly never-ending run to new heights got another boost on Monday with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) saying the yellow metal could be trading as high as $1,650 an ounce in a year. Goldman added that gold could see $1,400 an ounce in three months and $1,525 an ounce in six months and recommended buying Comex December 2011 gold futures and January 2011 Nymex platinum. For those that opt not to play the futures market, the platinum play is the ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT). Backed by physical platinum, PPLT and its cousin, the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) have become trendy picks to play a rebound in global auto demand. As for gold, if you're looking beyond the usual suspects like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares COMEX Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), the ProShares Ultra Gold ETF (NYSE: UGL) is a fine way to leverage your returns on gold's ascent. For whatever reason, the PowerShares DB Gold ETF (NYSE: DGL) rarely makes it into the gold ETF conversation, but don't ignore this fund. DGL tracks a rules-based index composed of futures contracts on gold and is intended to reflect the performance of gold. It goes without saying gold miners benefit from high gold prices, so be sure to be involved with either the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) or the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Silver is the derivative play of choice, though it wasn't mentioned in the Goldman report. The Market Vectors Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) is the way to go on that front."

2010-11-02,Eyes on Election Tonight Then Tomorrow's Fed  11-02-2010,"Cusick's Corner The election results will be watched overnight, but all eyes will be on the FOMC statement tomorrow, due out at 2:15 ET. The focus will be on the size of the Fed's highly anticipated Quantitative Easing. At this point, expectations are that the Republicans will take the House and that's already priced into the market. Republicans picking up some seats in the Senate, but not a majority is also believed to be priced in. $500 Billion or more QE seems to be mostly priced in -- so what is not priced into the market? On the political front, if the Republicans take majority in Senate, this would potentially add challenge to upside resistance. From the Fed's actions, if the size and extent of QE is smaller than expected, that would be potentially negative. Either way, volatility looks to be potentially on the horizon. Enthusiasm for any potential political or economic outcome could be met with some short-term skepticism, so stay on your toes, be prudent and do not use your emotions to make your trading and investment decisions. See you Midday. Major averages opened higher and then traded in a tight range Tuesday, as market action took a wait-and-see tone ahead of the mid-term election results and a Federal Reserve rate announcement Wednesday. With no economic data or earnings of importance to guide the early action, the focus was on a weaker dollar and strength across the commodities markets. However, after the initial run higher on Wall Street, trading stalled and the major averages stayed in a tight range throughout most of the session. Investors are not only waiting for mid-term election results to trickle in, but also for the Federal Reserve to clarify future policy action at the conclusion of its meeting Wednesday afternoon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in a 95-point range ahead of the news and finished up 64 points. The NASDAQ added 28.7. Bullish Flow Legg Mason (LM), the Baltimore, MD asset management firm, added 93 cents to $32.27 and LM options saw a noticeable uptick in activity Tuesday. Total volume rose to 6X the recent average daily, with 6,145 calls and only 49 puts traded on the session. Much of the activity was focused in the January 2012 calls at the 30 strike. 5178 traded, including a block of 1500 at the $6.70 asking price. It appears to be an opening buyer. December 31 and 35 calls saw interest as well. No news on the name, but the stock was added to Citigroup's top list pick Monday morning. Shares are in the midst of a three-day 5.6 percent run higher and today's call buyers might be looking for the rally to continue through 2011, into early 2012. Bullish options action was also seen in Lennar (LEN), Campbell's (CPB), and ADP. Bearish Flow A bearish spread trader surfaced in EOG Resources (EOG) ahead of its earnings. Shares finished the regular session up $1.67 to $97.74 and one strategist apparently initiated a bearish November 90 – 95 put spread at $1.35, 1500X. That is, they bought 1,500 November 95 puts at $2.21 and sold 1,500 November 90 puts at 85 cents. This spread is bearish because it offers a max pay-off of $3.65 (excluding commissions) if shares fall to $90 or less by the November expiration in two and half weeks. Time will tell if the spread was a smart move. EOG's earnings results have not yet been posted at the time of this writing. Bearish flow also picked up in Kohl's (KSS), Sara Lee (SLE), and Red Robin Gourmet Burgers (RRGB). Index Trading Overall action in the index market seems to reflect little concern about this week's remaining event risk. Volume was light and evenly divided between put and call options. According to Trade Alert data, 428,000 calls and 429,000 puts traded across the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) and other cash indexes Tuesday, which is about 79 percent the average daily volume for the index market. Meanwhile, the CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) broke a six-day winning streak. As the S&P 500 added 9.19 points to 1,193.57, VIX edged down .26 to 21.57. Rising stock prices, low index put volume and an easing VIX seem to reflect underlying optimism, even as results from the mid-term elections, Wednesday's Fed rating meeting, and Friday jobs data are looming on the horizon. ETF Trading Put volume picked up in the Market Vectors Juniors Gold Miner ETF (GDXJ) Tuesday. Shares of the fund, which holds a basket of mining names like Newmont (NEM) and Barrick Gold (ABX), notched a new 52-week high and finished up 48 cents to $36.76 after gold added $6.5 to $1,357.10 an ounce. Some contrarian-minded investors seem to be bracing for a pullback in the ETF, however, as the GDXJ December 36 puts saw increasing interest Tuesday. 10,245 changed hands. The top trade was a block of 7,252 contracts at the $1.60 asking price, which appeared to be a buyer opening a new position. If so, the put purchase has a breakeven of $34.60 at the December expiration, or 5.9 percent below current levels."
2010-11-04,Junior Gold Miners ETF Soaring (GDXJ),Shares of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are skyrocketing today on the back of a $44 move in the price of spot gold. The GDXJ has surged 6.59% to $39.45 during the trading session. Volume has been heavy with around 3.21 million shares trading hands compared to a daily average volume of 2.09 million. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (the Fund) seeks to replicate as closely as possible the price and yield performance of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners Index (the Index).

At last check, shares of GDXJ were up 79 cents this afternoon to $41.30, a gain of nearly 2%."
2010-11-08,Focus on US-Dollar  11-08-2010,"Cusick's Corner The rally lost its momentum today and the markets had a small sell-off. However, because of the slow news day and lack of any market data, most market participants focused on the action in the US Dollar that maintained its morning advance into the afternoon. Some upcoming data later this week -- several retailers will announce earnings which will help gauge consumer spending this holiday season. See you Midday. It was a day of sluggish and uninspired market action Monday. With no economic data or major earnings releases to guide the morning trading, stock market averages drifted lower in cautious action after big gains scored the week before. Some of the focus remains on the gyrations in the currency markets after the dollar edged modestly higher against some of the other majors. However, not much volatility was seen in the dollar or across global financial markets Monday and, at the end of the day, Wall Street finished mixed. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 37 points. The NASDAQ added 1.00. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) edged up .01 to 18.27. Trading in the options market was running about the typical levels and with clearly more call than put volume. About 10.3 million calls and 5.6 million puts changed hands. Bullish Flow Silver Wheaton (SLW) shares rallied and options volume hit 3X its normal levels ahead of earnings. Shares of the Vancouver-based silver company added $2.12 to $35.07. Meanwhile, 51,000 calls and 31,000 puts traded in the name. November 34 and 35s were the most active call options. December 32 and 35 puts saw interest as well. Implied volatility jumped 8 percent, as it appears that some investors were bracing for a big move in SLW. The company is due to report after the close of trading today, but as of this writing, has not yet posted the results. Bullish options action was also seen in Commscope (CTV), MGM, and Western Refining (WFR). Bearish Flow Las Vegas Sands (LVS), which has been ripping higher in recent days, added 82 cents to $52.80 and is now up 28.6 percent since the casino-operator reported earnings on 10/27. One strategist seems to be bracing for a pullback or perhaps looking to lock in gains, as a massive put spread traded in LVS. In this trade, the strategist bought 20,000 January 52.5 puts at $5.50 and sold 40,000 January 45 puts at $2.21. This ratio spread, at a net debit of $1.08, looks like a defensive play, as it makes its best profits if shares fall to $45 by the January expiration. By selling twice as many puts (compared to puts purchased), they are also stating that they're willing to buy the stock if shares trade below $45 between now and then. Bearish flow also picked up in Jo Ann Stores (JAS), Aeropostale (ARO), and International Game Technology (IGT). Index Trading The KBW/PHLX Bank Sector Index (.BKX) saw another big trade Monday. We noted in the previous market wrap that 70,000 March 52 calls traded on the index Friday, including a buyer of 40,000 at $2.25. The index edged down .39 to 48.38 today and another 40,000 March 52 calls traded. According to a source on the floor, this massive block of calls was sold at $2.25. So, this strategist might have had a sudden change of heart. That is, after buying to open the position Friday, they offset it through a liquidating trade Monday. ETF Trading Market Vectors Junior Gold Mining ETF (GDXJ) shares touched a new 52-week high and finished up $1.31 to $41.82 after gold (December) rose $10 to $1047.70 an ounce. Meanwhile, options volume in the ETF hit 4X the recent average daily, with 34,000 calls and 7,060 puts traded on the exchange-traded fund. Trading was brisk in the February 40 calls. One strategist sold 10,000 contracts. They also bought 8,000 of the February 46 calls and 4,500 December 43 call options. This looks like a roll. That is, the investor was liquidating a position in the in-the-money $40 calls and taking new positions in the out-of-the-money $43 and $46 call options. If so, they might have been bullish on the fund and are banking profits, but also opening new positions in anticipation of additional gains."

2010-11-16,November Rain: Nothing But Pain For These ETFs This Month,"Good grief. Wasn't this supposed to be a good month for stocks and ETFs? The Republicans dominated on Election Day. We got another round of quantitative easing. That good news has been countered by Ireland's fiscal mess and fears of an interest rate hike in China. Add in dollar strength and the past few days have been no time to be long. As such, recent ETF studs have turned into duds since last week. Let's look at a few. 1) iShares MSCI Thailand Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: THD): A Professor favorite, THD ran up almost in a straight line for six months and touched an all-time high at $68.70 earlier this month. THD has retreated 9% from that all-time high and is doing so on strong volume. The 20-day moving average didn't act as support and if the 50-day line fails as well, THD could fall below $60. 2) iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ): Any time investors get skittish about China, Brazil ETFs suffer. EWZ has also retreated almost 9% off its 52-week high at $81.77. The losing streak for EWZ is now pushing two trading weeks and if support around $74.50 doesn't hold, EWZ could retreat to $70. 3) Any mining ETF. Take a look at the performance of the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSE: COPX), the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) in the past week. All down about 8%. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has offered little respite, down more than 4% over the same time."

2010-12-07,Copper ETF: What's The Big Deal?,"News of the impending debuts of ETFs backed by physical copper sure has gotten a lot of attention. Copper-backed ETFs have become such a big deal that one might think the issuers fighting to enter the space have found a cure for cancer or solved cold fusion. There was the recent bit about JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) massive $1.5 billion copper trade on the London Mercantile Exchange. RBS has said a copper-backd ETF could boost prices to $4.50 a pound and one analyst quoted in a Financial Times piece said a successful copper ETF could be the difference between copper priced at $8,500 per ton and $10,000 per ton. Remember, the red industrial metal has never traded above $9,000 per ton. So as JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB), iShares and ETF Securities race to bring the first ballyhooed physical copper ETF to market investors may do well to, gasp, pay this even minimal attention. The reason is simple: In the ETF world, there are already exceptional ways to play copper. Meaning the miners. This is a trend that has already made itself clear with gold and silver. Gold mining ETFs, such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) have outperformed funds like the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD). Sure, the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) has been on fire, but the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) has been even better. When it comes to copper, the iPath DJ-UBS Copper TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: JJC) hasn't disappointed. On the other hand, the First Trust ISE Global Copper Index (NYSE: CU) and the Global X Copper Miners ETF (NYSE: COPX) have left JJC in the dust. So when it comes to a physical copper ETF, it might be fair to say No big deal. *Performance data is for the last three months."
2010-12-09,Volatility To Rise on the Junior Gold Miners? (GDXJ),"Shares of The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are higher on the session by 0.75%, currently trading at $41.82. The ETF has been moving largely higher over the past six months and is currently trading well above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. There has been quite a bit of put action on the GDXJ today. The action has been coming swift and heavy in January 2011, where every single put strike from $57.00 all the way down to $36.00 is active. Overall put volume is now running at 3.37x the daily average with 77% of all puts traded being purchases on the offer. Interestingly, the February $38/41 strangle also traded 5,000 times for $5.06. This went off in the middle of the bid/ask, but given the action in puts today, it seems likely that this was purchased as a volatility play. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF seeks replicating as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the price and yield performance of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners Index. The fund normally invests at least 80% of total assets in securities that comprise the index. The index tracks the overall performance of foreign and domestic publicly traded companies of small- and medium-capitalization that are involved primarily in the mining for gold and/or silver. The fund is non-diversified."
2010-12-16,Mining Stocks Face Short Term Pressure ,"Recently the gold mining stocks have been under pressure after making a new high in December 7th, 2010. The popular Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDX) traded as high as $64.62 on December 7th and is trading around $60.27 this morning. Normally after a stock or ETF makes a new high it will need to pause or consolidate the gains before trading higher. However, this time around the GDX has sold off and traded below the November 9th, 2010 top. When price action fails to hold the prior top or high it is usually an indication that a further correction is likely to take place. The GDX will have short term daily chart support around the $59.00 level which is the daily chart 50 moving average. The next important support level and likely bounce area for the GDX will be around the $57.50 area. The highly popular Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF(NYSE: GDXJ) is following a similar pattern to the GDX. This highly popular ETF will have some daily chart support around the $38.50 which is the daily chart 50 moving average. However, should the momentum push the ETF below this level the GDXJ will have strong support around the $37.25 area. Yamana Gold Inc.(NYSE: AUY) is a leading gold mining stock that made new highs for the year on December 7th, 2010 at $13.13. Since that time Yamana Gold Inc. has pulled back to $12.16. This stock is still trading above daily 20, and 50 moving averages which tell us that the stock is still in a strong technical position. Yamana Gold will have minor short term support around the $12.00. The $11.50 area is the daily 50 moving average and this should be fairly strong and a possible bounce level.

2010-12-20,This Popular Gold Investment Is a Snow Job ,"Folks looking to make a fortune in small gold stocks need to be careful: There's a right way to do it... and there are a lot of wrong ways to do it. One of the wrong ways to do it is by owning one of the world's most popular ETFs right now. The symbol is (NYSE: GDXJ). It goes by the name Market Vectors Junior Mining Fund. And that name is a snow job. Junior miners are the bloodhounds of the mining world. They are tiny companies that scour the world looking for the next big gold or silver discovery. And when I say tiny companies, I mean it. Junior miners are microscopic compared to the popular mining companies you might now. Many junior miners are around $30 million in market value. Compare this to mega-gold miner Barrick, with a market value of around $52 billion. That's more than 1,700 times the size of a $30 million company. Continue reading the article."
2010-12-27,Market Moving ETF Update,"The theme to this Weekly Market Report will be Exchange Traded Funds or ETF's as they are often called by most traders and investors. An exchange traded fund is a security that trades just like a stock. The ETF will usually track an index or specific sector in the market by holding a basket of individual securities. The PowerShares QQQ Trust, Series 1 (ETF) (NASDAQ: QQQQ) ended the week slightly higher ahead of the Christmas holiday. Since late August the technology heavy QQQQ's has rallied higher by over 20.0 percent. While the QQQQ's remain in a strong weekly uptrend there will be important daily chart price resistance levels approaching soon. Traders and investors should watch the $55.50 area for the next major daily resistance area. The weekly resistance levels will be at $60.00, and next at the $63.30 level. This week is the period between the Christmas and New Years holiday. This is usually a very light volume time in the markets which normally trade sideways to slightly higher. Therefore, unless a major geopolitical event occurs we would not expect much downside action. The top five holding in the QQQQ is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) 19.74%, Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) 4.73%, Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) 4.50%, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) 4.09%, and Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ: ORCL) 3.17%. The Oil Service HOLDRs (ETF) (NYSE: OIH) is a basket of the leading oil services companies. This index has soared higher by 40.0 percent since the announcement of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve Bank in late August. The OIH remains in a strong uptrend, however, it has stalled out around the $139.00 daily chart resistance level. Should the OIH trade above this current resistance area the $145.00, and $151.00 levels will be the next major resistance levels. Traders should watch for pullbacks around these important price points. The top five holdings for the OIH are Schlumberger Limited. (NYSE: SLB) 20.12%, Baker Hughes Incorporated (NYSE: BHI) 13.07%, Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) 12.60%, Transocean LTD. (NYSE: RIG)11.42%, and National-Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE: NOV) 8.62%. The Market Vectors Junior Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) remains in a correction after staging a 4.00 point sell off last week. The daily chart does have support around the $37.50 level which was tagged on Friday. Should this support area fail to hold the next important weekly support levels will be $35.25, and $32.50. Due to the light holiday volume it would be prudent to expect a small bounce off the current $37.50 area. The top five holdings in GDXJ are Semafo Inc. 5.16%, Allied Nevada Gold Corp. (AMEX: ANV) 4.29%, Alamos Gold Inc. 3.94%, Detour Gold Corporation 3.64%, and Coeur D'Alene Mines Corp. (NYSE: CDE) 3.61%. As long as central banks continue to print money at alarming rates gold, and gold miners will be a buy again at important support levels. InTheMoneyStocks"

2011-02-24,A Forgotten ETF For Gold's Rebound,"When it comes to gold ETFs, it seems like all the opinions, comments and buy and sell calls revolve around the usual suspects. ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) or another comparable fund backed by physical gold or the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and its small-cap cousin, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) command most of the headlines. Quiet as it may be kept, there are leveraged ways to play the gold miners, both from the long side and the short side and they come courtesy of who else but Direxion. With gold getting a boost thanks to Middle East tensions, let's have a look at the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 2x Shares (NYSE: NUGT). Credit to Direxion for a cute ticker, but NUGT really may be a hidden nugget when it comes to gold ETFs. To make things simple, consider NUGT the double leveraged cousin of GDX as both track the NYSE Arca GoldMiners Index. Just 2.5 months old, NUGT has stuggled on the volume and due to a sell-off in gold to start 2011, but gold's bull market of 2010 illustrated the power of mining ETFs, so why don't double up occassionally for a short-term trade with NUGT? NUGT's volume has started to increase a bit and the fund has done exactly what is supposed to do over short-term holding periods, returning GDX by almost 2x over the last five days. NUGT's inverse equivalent is the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 2x Shares (NYSE: DUST) in case you're feeling bearish on the miners."

2011-03-17,Global X Distills A Pure Gold Miners ETF,"Global X on Tuesday (3/15/11) rolled out a new ETF designed to target companies producing gold and only gold. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (GGGG) seeks to track an index that limits inclusion to companies that generate the vast majority of their business from gold mining. The underlying Solactive Global Pure Gold Miners Index restricts new index components to those with at least 95% of the company's revenues generated from gold mining. To remain in the index, that proportion must remain above 90%. Additionally, constituents are weighted proportionally on free float market capitalization with the largest positions capped at 4.75% each. The resulting country breakdown for the fund currently has Canada at 41.3%, South Africa 15.4%, U.S. 11.2%, Australia 9.1%, U.K. 6.4%, Jersey 4.8%, Russia 4.8%, China 4.1%, and Turkey 3.0%. GGGG has an expense ratio of 0.59%, and the fund has 30 holdings in all. The nine stocks capped at 4.75% during the last index rebalancing were Kinross Gold Corp (KGC), Anglogold Ashanti ADR (AU), Gold Fields Ltd ADR (GFI), Polyus Gold ADR (OPYGY), Eldorado Gold Corp (EGO), Randgold Resources Ltd-ADR (GOLD), Osisko Mining Corp (OSKFF), Petropavlovsk Plc, and Centerra Gold Inc. GGGG will be in competition with both Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ), as GGGG's holdings are found in both. However, due to its “pure” play philosophy, GGGG excludes many familiar names that don't meet that description including Barrick Gold (ABX), Newmont Mining (NEM), Buenaventura Mining Company (BVN), and Yamana Gold (AUY). Additional information is located on the summary page, in the fact sheet (pdf), and in the prospectus (pdf). Disclosure covering writer, editor, and publisher: No positions in any of the securities mentioned. No positions in any of the companies or ETF sponsors mentioned. No income, revenue, or other compensation (either directly or indirectly) received from, or on behalf of, any of the companies or ETF sponsors mentioned."
2011-04-02,ETF Showdown: This One's For Goldfinger,"Since the series debuted in 1962, 22 official James Bond movies have been produced. Did you know that three of the titles mention gold? Of those three, Goldfinger is probably still the most-well known and that film, the third in the 007 series, is still widely regarded as one of the best in the series. Basically, the villain, Auric Goldfinger, wants to loot Fort Knox for its gold. Fast-forward almost 50 years since the movie was made and plenty of conspiracy theorists openly say there isn't even any gold in Fort Knox. Maybe Auric Goldfinger would need to consider some ETFs if he was around today. So with that, this week's ETF Showdown compares two equity-based gold ETFs that might just appeal to Goldfinger himself. When discussing gold ETFs that track equities rather than featuring physical holdings of the commodity itself, that means we have to talk about gold miners and that leads us to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the big kahuna of equity ETFs with gold exposure. GDX is almost five years-old and has accumulated almost $660 million in assets under management, highlighting its dominance in this genre. But competition may be here in the form of the newly minted Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE: GLDX). GLDX is five months old, but has garnered $25.4 million in AUM since its debut. Gold explorers and gold miners, what's the difference? Well, the important difference to note with GDX and GLDX is the holdings. GDX has 31 holdings and GLDX has 31, but GLDX offers exposure to the more speculative side of gold stocks. Anyone that has invested in gold equities probably knows about Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), all of which can be found among GDX's top-10 holdings. On the other hand, companies like NovaGold Resources (AMEX: NG), Rubicon Minerals (AMEX: RBY) and other less heralded fare make up the bulk of GLDX's holdings. Since GLDX is more a junior miner play, it is more than 83% allocated to Canada at the country level compared to about 65% for GDX. GDX trumps its newer rival when it comes to expenses with an expense ratio of 0.53% compared to 0.65% for GLDX. Even the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) features lower fees than GLDX. The bottom line is that for investors that are simply gold crazy, GDX and GLDX combined could be a potent idea because that scenario covers large caps and more speculative issues. Still, it's usually a more sound idea to keep risk to a minimum with gold stocks, so GDX is probably the better bet for the conservative trader or investor."

2011-04-15,A Look Ahead: Next Week's ETFs To Watch,"A week of substantial headline risk be it at the hands of Japan, bearish views on oil or disappointing earnings results has drawn to a close and perhaps the best thing that can be said is Hey, at least stocks closed higher on Friday. Still, Friday's effort will do little to put a dent in weekly losses for the major U.S. indexes. With the earnings spigot wide open next week, we've got a great assortment of ETFs that should be in play so let's have a look at next week's ETFs to watch. 1) Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL): Two of KOL's to-be-acquired constituents, Bucyrus (Nasdaq: BUCY) and Massey Energy (NYSE: MEE) report on Monday. Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU), the largest U.S. coal producer, follows on Tuesday so next week promises to be busy for KOL. 2) ProShares Short Dow30 (NYSE: DOG) or the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE: DIA): Pick your poison here. Eight Dow stocks report next week. 3) SPDR KBW Regional Banking (NYSE: KRE) and the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF): Again, have it your way. There isn't a day next week when at least one marquee national or super-regional banking name doesn't step into the earnings confessional. 4) Oil Services HOLDRs (AMEX: OIH): Yes, this is an earnings play with Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) reporting on Monday and Diamond Offshore (NYSE: DO), Weatherford International (NYSE: WFT) and Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) reporting on Thursday, but OIH is also worth watching because options traders have been making some bearish bets on the fund in recent days and momentum could be waning here. 5) Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ): With gold jumping to another record on Friday, GDXJ's finish to the week was disappointing. We don't want to sound any alarms here, but this ETF really needs to break through $42 or risk forming an ominous double top."

2011-04-18,"Market Decline Equals A Chance To Add Gold Miners (GDX, GDXJ, GLDX, PSAU)","Even though physical gold prices have risen in the face of the today's S&P U.S. outlook, the companies that mine the metal have fallen hard. This gives investors a perfect opportunity to add the sector. Due to the miners' production cost structure (which comes with fixed expenses), these companies can act as a leveraged plays on gold prices. Essentially, a 1% increase in the price of gold will often equal a greater than 1% increase in a miners' operating income. This gives the gold miners a unique risk/return profile relative to physical gold. While the sector isn't known for its huge dividends, ever-increasing gold prices could change that. With gold hitting record highs, many firms are seeing operating margins surge for each ounce of gold produced. Many of the top producers have cash cost in the range of $400 to $600 per ounce. As the sector continues its trend of increased profitability, investors can expect more dividend increases. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NASDAQ: GDXJ) and Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NASDAQ: GLDX) all focus on different areas of the gold mining spectrum and could be used as plays for adding exposure. Investors may also want to consider the PowerShares Global Gold & Precious Metals (NASDAQ: PSAU) as well. Disclosure: Author is Long GDXJ and IAU"

2011-05-06,Take Advantage Of Dips In Precious Metals and Miners,"Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will continue devaluing the dollar (UUP) by keeping interest rates at all-time lows and continue quantitative easing as we have not seen a major improvement in unemployment and housing. We are also entering an election year in which central banks do not want to rile the equity markets. Just because the S&P (SPY) has been soaring does not mean the economy is improving. Easy money policies will continue for an extended period of time to fight against current economic weakness. This is an environment in which gold (UGL) and silver (AGQ) will benefit. We are currently seeing a massive inflationary environment globally that has caused political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East, and rising costs in key emerging economies such as China and South Korea. We must be prepared for these current short-term corrections in precious metals because it will provide additional buying opportunities in gold (GLD), silver (SLV) bullion and mining stocks (GDX). The market will try to make you be complacent when you should be fearful, and make you scared when you should be enthusiastic. I have mentioned that silver was 70% above the 200-day moving average, surpassing overhead resistance, reaching record levels on the oscillators and surpassing my late January technical targets. Silver has moved much faster and higher than I originally projected. I initially thought the move would last through May, but the speculative buying and short covering has caused silver to reach my target a few weeks ahead of schedule. Whenever these conditions occur, caution is merited as the odds of a shakeout have significantly increased. A healthy correction is necessary to maintain the long-term steady uptrend and provide secondary buypoints. Major institutions raises cash and began selling into a rising market as the speculative fever reached a climax the last two weeks of April. When the consensus gets greedy, I get fearful. Since late January when my indicators turned bullish on precious metals and mining stocks, we have seen record investment demand in silver and gold bullion combined with short covering. Tremendous record volume in the silver market indicated a short-term buying hysteria. These frenzies in the precious metals markets are often followed by quick and violent corrections which we are currently witnessing to shakeout the Johnny Come Lately traders who get overaggressive in these rising markets. Investors were building up very aggressive and speculative positions. The conditions in silver have been setting up for a painful pullback. A healthy correction is currently necessary to sustain the long-term steady uptrend in hard assets. Most investors do not realize that precious metals are in a long-term secular uptrend but there will be volatility with ebbs and flows. Silver is an extremely turbulent market which exceeds technical targets and momentum oscillators regularly. Silver blows very hot and very cold exceeding to the upside and the downside. This is a chart I sent my readers April 22, 2011. I needed to be careful about this move in silver in late April surpassing my late January target of $40 and the US dollar bearish sentiment which was reaching an extreme in late April. Silver exceeded upper trend channels and saw record volume, showing signs of a shakeout. I was very concerned that silver was overheating as the herd tried to force its way into this trade. Whenever I have seen these parabolic moves, they have not ended well as the profit-taking begins and the investors who have overleveraged themselves get margin calls. I am not surprised at all about this painful shakeout. Precious metals investors may be repositioning from bullion into mining stocks. This consolidation may be the catalyst to help the miners catch up with the performance of gold and silver bullion. Mining stocks have not yet seen the speculative levels that bullion has seen. The general public is now realizing that inflation and precious metal prices will be high for some time to come as Bernanke has no plans of exiting, but are reluctant to enter bullion at these pricey levels. Miners, especially junior explorers (GDXJ) are providing a discount to bullion. Inflation will continue for years to come yet this correction in the junior miners (GDXJ) indicates the public is still unaware of the basic fundamental and growth potential of this sector over then next decade especially when gold and silver find support. This has been no surprise to my readers. I have said that there is no exit plan from the Fed. There is a concerted effort to devalue the US currency to pay back soaring debts. The US is broke and it can't afford raising interest rates. Savers are getting swindled by leaders in Washington, which has used public taxpayer money to bail out corporations and banks. Americans are getting squeezed by soaring prices of basic goods, while their hard-earned savings are depreciating. I have urged caution around initiating positions in gold or silver bullion as the trade was very crowded and at the end stages of its short-term move from late January through May. Remember, gold has a historic cycle to provide a sale every six months. As gold and silver sell off, don't forget the long-term uptrend will stay intact. Will you be ready for the next turning point in precious metals as the herd sells out during the panic? I believe junior mining stocks (GDXJ) will catch up. Some people are concerned that some of the mining stocks that haven't moved yet should be sold while they're reaching long-term support and basing. I don't believe so as they all provide leverage to falling currencies and rising demand from emerging economies. As these mining stocks sell off, I begin to look at the long-term fundamentals which have not changed. Perceptions from the herd change but the fundamentals in gold miners (GDX) do not. One must take advantage of sell-offs in gold and silver miners; they are opportunities to get on board the secular bull market in precious metals. I believe it is the best way to protect one's assets during these times of growing record deficits and currency devaluations."
2011-05-10,Market Vectors Indonesia ETF Reaches $500M AUM,"The Market Vectors Indonesia ETF (NYSE: IDX), the first Indonesia-specific ETF listed in the U.S., has reached the lofty $500 million in assets under management level, according to Van Eck, the parent company of Market Vectors. IDX made its debut in January 2009 and in that time has established itself as the leader among Indonesia-specific ETFs listed in the U.S. iShares, the largest U.S. ETF issuer, introduced the iShares MSCI Indonesia Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: EIDO) a year ago, and while that fund has done admirably in attracting assets, its $184.4 million in AUM is still dwarfed by IDX. As of March 31, the index IDX tracks contained 35 stocks covering an array of sectors, including banks with a weight of 26.6%, consumer discretionary with a weight of 13.7%, energy with an allocation of 15.5% and materials with a weight of 12.7%. Bank Central Asia, Astra International and Telekomunik Indonesia are the ETF's top three holdings. Earlier this year, Van Eck cut the expense ratio on IDX to 0.6% from 0.68% and the shares were later split three-for-one. In addition to IDX, there are six other Market Vectors ETFs with over $500 million in AUM. Those funds are the following: The Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO), the Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL), the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX) and the Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: BRF).

2011-05-18,Dollars of Future Passed...,"There is so much talk these days regarding the end of the FED’s QE2 or quantitative Easing part 2 that has resulted in both professional and amateur investor confusion. Add to the mix the constant MOPE (Management of Perceived Expectations) from “B52 Ben’s” minions and throw in to the mix the bloviating statements put forth by everyone’s favorite Treasury Secretary “Turbo Timmy” Geihtner all contradicting themselves also has set the stage for the investment community to be off kilter. Of course keeping investors off balance and guessing is exactly what the FED and other players want as each has their own agenda and is basically playing for time. In my mind there is no question that QE3 is coming of course I cannot tell you at what point she will dock. It is also doubtful that QE3 would be called by that moniker but “a rose by any other name would still be a rose”. I highly doubt that QE3 would sail on in right after the end of QE2, instead we will see games played with the FED’s bloated and highly over valued balance sheet. I believe it was James Rickards who coined the QE Lite term and that is what I believe the FED will engage in. The FED will use maturing debt and interest earned to reinvest in treasuries essentially keeping the music from stopping. The amount the FED will be reinvesting will be sufficient to avert the catastrophe of full detox shakes required to actually right the economy but not enough to stave off the withdrawal pains. Instead I believe the FED is playing for time and actions have been taken to essentially create the façade of credibility so that they can jam QE3 down our throats when the economy is looking like the music is stopping again. I have noted in the past that the FED is taking a page from the French Assignat playbook of the late 1700’s that ultimately lead to worthlessness of that currency. The French economy was in the doldrums and the government printed a bunch of Assingats and the economy would act much better for a while. Going forward each time the economy of France slowed sufficiently the government would print more Assingats and things would get temporarily better, until they just didn’t as the Assignat was toast. Today we have fancy names and methods for hiding money printing and devaluation but semantics aside the end destination is the same. No different than a wife making excuses for her alcoholic husband we hear from all levels of government, economists and media that the Dollar cannot be replaced, or will not lose its reserve currency status. I want you to think dear reader about what has transpired in the last decade, no better yet even the last couple years. Would you have believed that GM could become Government Motors, or that Wall Street would be bailed out or the mortgage mess could have occurred? Would you have envisioned the changes going on throughout the world from natural disasters to political upheaval? As humans we have a tendency to extrapolate the future by looking to the past, however, this is not a correct assumption. As the 18thCentury Scottish Philosopher, David Hume posited, there is no real reason to believe that future has to resemble the past in fact it could be argued that it is an irrational expectation to believe so. In other words humans tend to be guilty of linear thinking that just because it was so before so shall it be forever. Of course the idea that the past dictates how things will be in the future is a silly notion, just look in your own life for proof on smaller scale. Take the internet for example, many of us had newspaper subscriptions and had the paper delivered to the house. If I had to guess today judging by circulation numbers that most of you reading this missive get your news through an alternative to actual newsprint, probably online as I do. By thinking in a linear fashion it would have been assumed that everyone would continue to get their news via printed materials delivered to their home, but clearly something has changed. Even the financial industry gets this concept as they constantly proclaim past performance is not indicative of future results. Yet the economists and media pundits continue to utilize linear thinking applying it to things like the Dollar, real estate, reserve currencies, US Government debt and infinite number of other things. The changes we are discussing take time and some even move at a glacial pace, but they do move. To me the move away from the Dollar as a store of value let alone the world’s reserve currency has been moving at that glacial pace. It is more akin to the shifting of tectonic plates on the earth’s crust. The plates that make up the continents are in continual motion that is imperceptible to us building pressure as the plates move and when the tension achieves its maximum it results in an earthquake. The continual drama we are living through with our economy is building pressure on the tectonic plates that hold the Dollar and US Government debt. At some point the plates will shift and all the economists, politicians and banksters who currently say that it is impossible for the paradigm to change will be wrong. I do not know when, but I do know that the paradigm will shift. There will be some event that will cause governments and people around the world to shift away from Dollar assets and or demand higher rates of interest and payment regardless of what today’s experts say. If you could travel back in time and go to a pub in England in the early 1900’s and tell the patrons that the US Dollar would supplant the Pound and that England would become but a player in the US’s shadow they would have thought you a lunatic. Flash forward to today and we have and establishment dealing with the problem of our debt and spending, and unfortunately at all levels these people think in a linear fashion and look to the remedies of the past to fix the future. If one throws in to the mix the notion that all sides have an agenda which do not necessarily lend themselves to the best interests of solving the country’s problems. Instead we have two ideological points of view both out of touch with reality that promotes each side’s unyielding view of what they want the US to be like. I can remember growing up watching what used to take place in Washington seeing the politicians sparing with each other over issues but eventually coming to a compromise and then going out for drinks after session. Today the object of the game is to block your opponent at every step and vilify them in the media not exactly an atmosphere conducive to problem solving. It could be that the rest of the world has sensed that not only are we at a crossroads fiscally and economically but they also are voting by not automatically running to the Dollar. Avoidance of the Dollar was best exemplified when the crisis erupted in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) and instead of running to the safe haven of the Dollar people around the world moved in the Swiss Franc, gold and silver. Before Silver did its now famous swan dive as a result of the 5 CME margin hikes in 8 days all I kept hearing about was how there were something like 99% Dollar bears and that the dollar was to embark on a multi month rally as a result. I did not buy the premise then and I don’t buy it now that the dollar is going to run up to the 80’s on the DXY. The latest evidence I have shows that while the trade may have been crowded the supposed rally is not nearly robust as one was lead to believe. The open interest in the Dollar has remained rather flat all the time that it has been rising. Additionally, the commercial players who are right the vast majority of the time have reduced their position during this rise while the large longs have somewhat increased their position. Conversely, if you look at the chart below you can plainly see that throughout this supposed rally in the dollar that the small speculator open interest has gone parabolic. To me the fact that the small spec is fueling this rise and the strong downtrend is in place says this is nothing more than a short term bounce. There are those that argue that because the Dollar on the DXY exceeded its 50 day moving average that it is in rally mode, but just as we have seen in gold, silver and equities moving above an average particularly in a down trending bear market is no guarantee that the rally will continue. I believe instead that the current Dollar uptick is in the process of exhausting itself either at this level or by the time it gets to 77.5 near the major downtrend line (assuming that it can continue to climb) and then will resume its trek down toward the 64 level as my initial target. Dollar Chart 5/18/2011 including sentiment data and Commitment of Traders information: Sentiment indicators from Forexpros.com for 5/18/2011 and last week. Assuming that the Dollar does continue its decline then that would be bullish for the equity markets and in particular for the energy stocks and precious metals group. The sentiment in the precious metals group is at a level where the issues could rally, while if history holds true the energy sector still has some work to do. There are a couple charts posted below showing the bullish percentage for the energy sector and the precious metals. In the energy sector there are lots of names to choose from like the large caps Conoco (NYSE: COP), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Total (NYSE: TOT) or smaller plays like Occidental (NYSE: OXY) and Satoil (NYSE: STO). I personally like Statoil and Occidental as I believe that provide excellent value and potential as the oil shares turn around. Statoil is a Norwegian oil producer which like many of its brethren had gotten beaten down as a result of the current dollar rally and the oil futures margin recently implemented by CME Group. Statoil is a solid company that is currently trading at about 7.5x future earnings and is currently oversold. Statoil is very attractive at today’s price level. Occidental Petroleum is an independent Oil and Gas producer that has been a great performer in the past and is currently completing a pull back and bounce off of its long term uptrend line. OXY is currently oversold and should rally nicely with the rest of the oil and gas sector. Oxy is projected to grow earnings on the order of 52% for 2011 and looking forward to 2012 earnings are supposed to grow 16% as well. I have owned OXY in the past and it is a very good company and has delivered well in the past. OXY sports a forward PE of 10.6 and a PEG ratio of 1.14 so it is not overly expensive; and as a bonus you collect a 1.8% dividend to boot. I believe that OXY is very attractive at the current level. The precious metals are actually in very good shape from a sentiment perspective and this suggests that the shares are close to if not already mmaking a bottom. As for the precious metals there are many to choose from but I prefer to buy intermediate producers and a couple of the majors. The miners I favor once the sector gets some legs are GoldCorp (NYSE: GG), First Majestic (NYSE: AG) , SilverCorp (NYSE: SVM), Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), Silver Wheaton (NYSE: SLW), Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) , US Gold (NYSE: UXG) just to name a few. If you want a diversified basket of larger and mid cap miners then save yourself the aggravation and just buy the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). On the other hand, if you are looking to invest in juniors my best advice is to either use the ETF Market Vectors Junior gold (NYSE: GDXJ) or look in to the Tocqueville Gold Fund (Mutual Fund : TGLDX) run by long time gold mining portfolio manager John Hathaway. I suggest the two options above for investing in juniors because it is much more complex to assess the juniors that will be successful versus those that will always be just a hole in the ground. Investing in juniors requires knowledge and research that most investors do not have so the funds mentioned are a better alternative. Well that is it for today and I know that this missive kind of ran the gambit and I apologize for that, but I hope you still enjoyed the piece. Until next week stay healthy and good investing.

2011-06-10,"Slower China, Cheaper Gold","Gold and silver declined on Friday morning, following data released about Chinese imports. Chinese copper imports declined 3% in May, and oil imports stayed flat at 5 million barrels a month, as reported by Bloomberg. Those investors who have suspected that a global economic slowdown was eminent may have had their beliefs justified. Why would gold and silver decline on the news? Silver has limited industrial uses, and therefore may be following copper downward, on expectations of reduced demand for the metal in the future. Gold, on the other hand, has limited industrial uses and has a tendency to move on an inflationary vector, inversely corresponding to the movements in the values of fiat currencies. With China slowing, and hence the global economy, expectations for inflation may be dwindling as well. However, on the other hand, if the global economy is slowing, investors might suspect that central banks around the world—particularly the Federal Reserve—will initiate another round of monetary stimulus. That could be bullish for the metals in the long-run. Thus, today's price pullback may be an opportune time for investors to jump into the market. Action Items Bullish: Traders who believe that gold will rally from here as economic growth resumes or banks flood the world with liquidity, might want to consider the following trades:Buy SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD). GLD is a pure play on the price of gold.Buy Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE: GDXJ). A potentially riskier play than GLD, but with a possibly higher return. The smaller gold mining companies might have the potential for higher upside growth than the metal itself. Bearish: Traders who believe that the economy is due for a slowdown and monetary stimulus has come to an end, may consider taking positions in the following:PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish Index (NYSE: UUP) is a pure play on the value of the U.S. dollar. If investors flee to cash, UUP may do well if the dollar appreciates.iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSE: AGG) is a play on U.S. bonds.

2011-06-10,Gold and Silver Dealer Kitco Under Investigation,"On Thursday, Canadian based precious metals dealer Kitco was raided by Montreal police on charges of tax fraud. According to authorities, the company was engaged in a system of repetitive false billing and tax evasion. According to CBCNews, Kitco has denied any wrong doing. Since its inception in the late 1970s, Kitco has become a major dealer in precious metals in North America. It has offices in the United States and Canada, and runs one of the most popular precious metal websites on the internet. The raid comes at an interesting time. While gold has technically been in a bull-run for over a decade, the metal has most strongly appreciated in price since 2008, and has increased in price most significantly within the past year. The rising prices may mean more transactions, and more potential for fraud. Could the Kitco scandal foreshadow what's to come? Action Items Bullish: Traders who believe that Kitco's scandal foreshadows future weakness in the gold market might want to consider the following trades:Short SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD). GLD attempts to return a value corresponding to the general price of gold. If gold tanks, GLD may as well.Buy PowerShares DB US Dollar Bullish Index (NYSE: UUP). Investors running from gold may flee to the U.S. dollar which could be bullish for UUP. Bearish: Traders who believe that the bull-run in precious metals will continue may consider taking positions in the following:Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE: GDXJ). GDXJ is a play on junior gold miners, and may have more upside potential than just playing the metal.Global X Silver Miners (NYSE: SIL) is a play on silver mining companies.

2011-06-13,Liquidity Crisis Intensifies Mining Stock Sell-off,"Any thoughts of a bubble in precious metals is not pertinent at this time. As long as mining stocks are not in favor then any thoughts of a bubble are not applicable in the current situation. Mining stocks should be soaring in tandem with their brothers in bullion. Such is not the case. Miners are trading far below general market valuation. In past history during a bubble, mining stocks soared to hundreds of dollars a share at the same time as bullion. Wealth in the ground represents an open ended warrant on mining potential. Mines can grow, new ore bodies can be found, while bullion has no such potential open ended expansibility. Gold mining stocks(GDX) are incredibly cheap at $1500 gold(GLD). Before the credit crisis in March of 2008 as gold hit $1000 an ounce, miners (GDX) hit its all time high of $55. Now three years later gold is 50% higher, yet the miners have barely been able to breakout of the $55 range. Yamana (AUY) and Kinross (KGC) Gold are two majors that have been significantly underperforming gold over the past three years and are not near their pre credit price levels in 2008. These stocks have not provided any leverage to the price of gold to their shareholders. Investors are sticking to the bullion etf's and are disinterested in the miners. This lack of interest in this sector signals we still have some way to go in this precious metals bull market. The gold miners should be trading higher if they kept pace with the rise in the bullion. The standard deviation between miners and gold bullion has never been so great. It is at times such as these that investors can benefit from this apparent discrepancy. Currently mining stocks have corrected because of apprehension regarding the possible exit from QE2 and growing difficulties for miners worldwide. Investors who were burned during the 2008 credit crisis are concerned about a repetition of such an occurrence and its effect on a potential counter trend rally in the U.S. dollar (UUP) and long term treasuries (TLT). Small mining companies (GDXJ) depend on a readily available line of credit. Investors fear if the flow of capital were to be shut off as had been their experience in the past, their ability to operate might be impaired. This may represent a buying opportunity for investors in small miners(GDXJ). Miners represent assets in the ground whereas etf's such as GLD and SLV may have a built in weakness in the actual physical gold and silver they are holding. If called upon to produce the actual bullion, they might not be able to do so. This would favor mining stocks which represent actual wealth in the ground. There may be an implicit weakness in the very nature of a strictly bullion etf. Simply put a large quantity of bullion may not be able to be produced on demand. Do not be surprised if the bullion etf's find themselves unable to meet the demands of the marketplace. In such cases, the miners would once again come into favor as the investment vehicle of choice. At present there is a deviation between bullion and assets in the ground. Investors may be reluctant to hold paper in such a climate of fear and uncertainty. There are presently astute wealthy investors who have sold some of their bullion to purchase mining stocks. Again note that many miners are presently languishing while bullion etf's struts across the financial stage. This anomaly may not last much longer. Presently mining stocks are going through a major firesale, while bullion commands center stage. In the markets, it is prudent to expect the unexpected. That is why we should seize the opportunity to buy straw hats in winter. Such an opportunity may be upon us now as bullion etf's may stumble in the future. The gold mining etf (GDX) may be making a critical turn in the low 50's as it has broken through trend support. The technical conditions are even more oversold than the reversal lows in January 2011, July 2010 and February of 2010. A move above the trendline and moving averages may turn out to be a very powerful buy signal and signal the current correction is over. Careful monitoring of the uptrend is required.

2011-06-14,Bernanke Wants More Debt to Get Less Debt,"The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, gave a speech on Tuesday, in which he urged congressional leaders to tackle the long-term fiscal imbalances of the United States without failing to raise the debt ceiling. Bernanke argued that the deficit should decrease naturally as the economy expands and employment returns to normal levels. Yet, he stated that the long-term problems of the U.S.'s present fiscal imbalances would be severe if not acted upon. Bernanke stated that as debt levels increased the economy would become more susceptible to fiscal shocks, and a crowding-out effect—wherein invested capital goes to the government rather than the private sector—would stifle economic growth. Interest rates could rise rapidly, as the economic troubles in Europe have demonstrated, Bernanke explained. It is impossible to accurately predict the moment when the bond market would decide to abandon a country's debt, but Bernanke stated that each day the U.S. does not get its fiscal house in order is one day closer to that scenario playing out. Bernanke bluntly stated that the status quo was impossible to maintain. The U.S. should, as quickly as possible, create a long-term plan to reduce fiscal imbalances. Further, any plan created must be a credible one. Bernanke suggested implementing a legal GDP-to-debt ratio and working to reduce that ratio over time. Still, Bernanke was emphatic in his displeasure with those using the debt ceiling to push for fiscal cuts. Bernanke stated that if the debt ceiling is not reached before the August deadline, there would be severe financial consequences. Interest rates could immediately spike, which would make it more difficult for the U.S. to make interest payments, further slowing recovery. Some have suggested a solution wherein the debt ceiling would not be raised, but government payments would be appropriated to bond holders while other payments would be delayed. Bernanke dismissed this argument, stating that it would decrease overall confidence in U.S. debt. Action Items Bullish: Traders who believe that Congress will follow Bernanke's advice and raise the debt ceiling while reducing long-term fiscal budget deficits might want to consider the following trades:Buy Power Shares DB US Dollar Bullish Index (NYSE: UUP) in a long dollar play. The dollar has been under selling pressure, but might rally if the U.S. is able to constrain its long-term budget.Buy iShares Lehman Aggregate Bond (NYSE: AGG) in a long play on U.S. bonds. If the U.S debt situation becomes more attractive, the U.S. bond market might rally. Bearish: Traders who believe that the U.S. will default, or otherwise fail to reduce its long-term budget deficits may consider taking positions in the following:SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) is a long play on the precious metal gold. Gold has appreciated in price significantly over the past several months, and may head higher if the U.S. is unable to get its deficits under control, as investors seek to dump their paper currency for the safe-haven of gold.Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE: GDXJ) is a more aggressive play on gold.

2011-07-06,How To Play The Chinese Rate Hike,"This morning, the People's Bank of China announced it would be raising its key interest rate by 25 basis points, effective tomorrow to combat price stability and curb inflation. The move had been expected, but what was not expected was the timing. Foreign exchange strategists had been expecting the central bank to raise rates this weekend, not in the middle of the week. The move will be effective tomorrow, and will bring the benchmark one-year lending rate to 6.56% and the one-year deposit rate to 3.5%. The interest rate announcement is having a negative impact on commodities and equities this morning, with stocks around the world modestly lower. The interest rate hike will be affective tomorrow, but the market is discounting the move today, as the announcement was made today. This can be seen as bearish for commodities, as China is the world's largest importer of commodities, from iron ore, to copper, to steel, and so on. ACTION ITEMS:Bearish:Traders who believe that commodities will continue to fall might want to consider the following trades:Shorting names such as Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX) could be profitable if copper continues to fall. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) is another name to short, as gold is likely to see an outflow, as China raises interest rates. iPath DJ-UBS Copper TR Sub-Idx ETN (NYSE: JJC) is an ETF that is likely to be under pressure today due to the Chinese interest rate hikeBullish:Traders who believe that that this is just a temporary blip in the road may consider an alternate positions:Traders may want to consider looking at junior gold miners, and can capture all of them with the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ).Traders can also add or initiate positions in oil names, as oil is being hit this morning.

2011-07-08,Check Out The Chart: Signs Of Life For This Mining ETF,"One theme that has been beaten like a dead horse this year has been the slack performance of gold and silver mining stocks and ETFs relative to the underlying metals. Even before the infamous margin hikes on silver that led to a plunge in spot silver prices, silver miners and the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) hadn't delivered returns worth writing home about in 2011. While the S&P 500 is up over 6% year-to-date, SIL is down 8.6% while the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down 7.44%. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), today's “Check Out The Chart” subject, is even worse, having plunged 9.2% year-to-date. In fact, GDXJ's June slide was so violent that the ETF actually made a new low for 2011 in the $32 area before finding support and bouncing higher. Since late June, the ETF has been in rally mode and even with a small loss on Friday (as of this writing), GDXJ is still up nearly 7.5% in the past five trading days. Now, it might just be fair to say the ETF has an interesting chart. Not necessarily really strong, but certainly not as weak as was seen in June. GDXJ is doing battle with some resistance at the 200-day moving average at $36.55 and a move above that area gives the ETF plenty of real estate to run back to $42-43 area, the upper end of which represents the 2011 high. GDXJ's stochastics show the ETF may a be a tad overbought in the near-term, but the relative strength indicator is far from signaling overbought conditions, perhaps indicating that as investors embrace riskier assets such as small-caps again, GDXJ is poised to benefit. Of course, it is dangerous to assume that gold miners are simply overdue to rally in unison with spot prices for the yellow metal. That argument could have been made several months ago and would have proven quite unprofitable. That said, gold miners have suffered some nasty technical blows this year, indicating the worst may be behind the group. With seasonal trends favoring higher gold prices right now, mining stocks and ETFs, GDXJ included, may be poised to rally in the back half of 2011. If nothing else, GDXJ has a favorable risk/reward scenario here. Check out the chart."
2011-07-13,"Check Out The Chart: Silver Miners, Too?","Last week in our “Check Out The Chart” feature, we highlighted the vexing issue of rising precious metals prices, but the underperformance of gold and silver mining stocks and ETFs relative to the metals. The ETF we focused on was the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), which has jumped about 4% in the past five trading days, a move no doubt helped by gold's move to a record high earlier today. We also mentioned the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) in passing and that is the ETF we will drill down on today and the timing is right as silver futures are putting in their best one-day performance since March 2009. That's powering SIL to a 6% gain on volume that is already about 10% above the daily average and providing beleaguered investors in the ETF some reason to cheer after wicked slide that saw SIL tumble from above $31 in April to around $22 last month. That is the area where SIL started to form a base and support there looks firm in the event of another pullback. Of course, it should be noted that the ETF is now trading above $26, something it hasn't done in over a month. Does that mean buyers here are late to the party? Probably not. Looking at SIL's chart and assuming a purchase price in the area of $26.50 and a stop-loss at $22, the risk/reward on SIL is favorable because there is an open runway in front of SIL as we speak with no material resistance until the $32 area. Interestingly enough, investors can use the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) as a proxy for SIL because the two ETFs have moved in lock-step with each other over the past three months. So if some forecasts are right and silver futures return to $45 or higher, that means SLV should rise another $7 or so. Carry that over to SIL and $33 appears to be a reasonable price target meaning an entry even at $27 could still be profitable. Check out the chart."

You already know the usual suspects such as the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL). As is always the case, popularity is not a guarantee of returns and the mining sector is definitely an area where it pays to look off the beaten. Even better is that this approach can be extended to miners of both base and precious metals. With the latter finally showing some signs of life, let's have a look at five mining ETFs your broker probably forget to mention. First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ): Don't let the names deceive you. FXZ really isn't a kissing cousin to an ETF like XME. In fact, FXZ may just be the closest thing to a chemicals industry ETF out there because that sector accounts for over 43% of the ETF's weight. And by chemicals, we don't mean Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) or DuPont (NYSE: DD). This ETF offers exposure to a different, more obscure group of names. FXZ has been trapped in a narrow range between $23.50 and $26 this year, so buy above $26 on a breakout. Rydex S&P 500 Equal Weight Materials ETF (NYSE: RTM): Sick of excessive weights to Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX), DuPont and the like in your materials ETF? Try RTM on for size. Home to 30 familiar materials with no single constituent getting weight larger than 3.72% or less than 3.41%. Equal-weight ETFs do work, but in a taste test between XME and RTM, XME's wins by a wide margin regarding performance. iShares S&P Global Materials ETF (NYSE: MXI): There have been times when we've felt like we were the only ones singing the praises of this ETF, so it may surprise some to learn MXI has soared over 30% in the past year. View MXI this way: Iron demand is forecast to continue rising, especially in the emerging markets. The three largest iron ore makers in the world are Vale (NYSE: VALE), Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP). Those stocks account for 20% of MXI's weight. First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (Nasdaq: PLTM): As good as it when it comes to a platinum mining ETF, PLTM has suffered a similar fate to other precious metal mining ETFs this year. That is a shellacking. Gold and silver mining ETFs have started to show some signs of life recently, but the same cannot be said of PLTM. Not yet anyway. If platinum and palladium prices bounce, maybe the miners will finally join the party. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG): The newest member of the lists, GGGG is just five months old. Home to 30 stocks, the ETF is a legitimate competitor and alternative to GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) as it mixes well-known gold miners with more obscure names. GGGG's anonymous days may be drawing to a close as gold miners have started to rally and the ETF has surged 10% in the past month."

2011-07-19,"How To Play $2,500 Gold","Yesterday, gold crossed the $1,600 level and it looks as if there is no stopping the precious metal, considering the debt concerns we have at home and abroad. Many are convinces that $1,600 is the next stop on the way to $2,000 an ounce, and perhaps even $2,500 if things really get out of hand. Yesterday we saw fears that Greece may be allowed to default, and the consistent and persistent worries that the U.S. could actually default. Over the weekend, Egan-Jones downgraded U.S. debt, but no one cared because it is not Fitch, Moody's or S&P. If and when one of the three major rating agencies does downgrade U.S. debt (which seems more likely by the day due to the ineptitude of Congress), there are two outcomes for precious metals: either soaring to heights unseen before, or plunging as investors try to raise cash from anything and everything. The more likely scenario is that gold and other precious metals will soar should a U.S. default become reality. Given the fact that S&P has asked for $4 trillion in cuts over the next decade, even if a deal were to get done, there is still a strong chance a downgrade could happen. Besides a potential downgrade of U.S. debt, there are other factors happening at home that could cause gold to blow past yesterday's intraday high was $1,607.90 an ounce, before settling at $1,602.40 per ounce. The economy is weakening, no doubt, due in large part to the devastation that happened in Japan. Automakers had a tough time getting parts, semiconductor companies had supply constraints and there were numerous other factors that have caused recent economic numbers to show a weakening in the U.S. As such, we could see further easing in the United States, as hinted at in the minutes from the Federal Reserve June policy meeting. The minutes were released on July 12, and ever since then, gold, as well as silver have been jumping. If the Fed and Chairmen Ben Bernanke do decide to do additional easing, the U.S. dollar would continue to depreciate, triggering a flight to precious metals. This could potentially pave the way for $2,000 gold. Talk about a yellow brick road paved with profits. I think people are coming to realize that the economy is weakening again and the government might see a need to try to stimulate the economy further, said Joe Foster, portfolio manager for the Van Eck Global International Investors Gold Fund to CNN Money. There are still worries about Europe and Greece in particular, according to Foster. Greece is sort of on the verge of default and they're still trying to figure out how to engineer a recovery for Greece without inflicting a default on the country [and] the markets are sensing that's almost impossible, he said to CNN Money. Until the situation is resolved in these peripheral countries, it's going to drive gold. We may not see $2,500 gold tomorrow or next year, but if we see more easing and continued worries about defaults, the streets are not going to be paved with asphalt anymore. The streets will be paved with gold. Just don't have Ron Paul ask Ben Bernanke if gold is money again. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that gold is likely to continue to climb might want to consider the following trades:Buying gold miners such as Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Hecla Mining (NYSE: HL) or Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) could prove to be profitable as gold soars to new highs. If traders do not want single equity exposure, they may want to consider ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD), which tracks the price of gold. Other ETFs to consider are Market Vectors Gold Etf Trust (NYSE: GDX) or Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Bearish:Traders who believe that gold is likely to fall sharply from these levels as issues are resolved may consider alternate positions:Go long PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP), which should rise in face of problems being solved.

2011-07-20,Buy Gold Dips Because U.S. Politicians Are Ugly Actors,"FRANKFURT - Buy as much gold on any pullbacks as the made-for-TV miniseries drags on and on. The theatrics in the Senate, the House, and the Oval Office, wouldn't cut it on a high school stage, but when you got enough corporate sponsors it gets play on every idiot box around the world. It's The Debt Ceiling, starring Dr No, Mitch Earmarks McConnell, Harry I'm-Not-Gay Reid, The Big O, the insane tea baggers, and a supporting cast of hundreds of others who need to emote before the cameras. The climax will be when the uglies figuratively throw grandma under the bus and steal her social security. And there's sure to be great applause when one of the ugly actors helps grandma up, but the camera will miss it when the ugly actor kicks her back down again. The little voice in my head is screaming at me, Ramon, pedal your bike to that dealer near Zeil and get a few coins for your pocket! Maybe you've got more cash and can back up your gas-guzzling truck. I probably would if I could. Even Mr. Gold, Jim Sinclair, says the new magnet to watch is $1,764. If you somehow still trust paper you can pick up SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD). You can also look at the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). For leverage, there is the PowerShares DB Gold Double Long ETN (NYSE: DGP) and the ProShares Ultra Gold (NYSE: UGL). If you think gold has topped out, that The Debt Ceiling isn't half bad. To make serious coin on gold's decline try the PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) or the ProShares UltraShort Gold (NYSE: GLL). As far as Eric Cantor betting on a U.S. default: if he were my older brother I'd whack him upside his head with a two-by-four. As Gerald Calente says, Politics is show business for ugly people. Sadly, he's right. Maybe I better jump on my bike. If you have any new tips for me or want to send me gold, contact me at ramon.lewis.benzinga@gmail.com."
2011-07-20,A Gold Plated Yacht? Yup,"Seriously folks, it really exists. History Supreme is the world's most expensive yacht, coming in at $4.8 billion The yacht is made of 100,000 kilograms of solid gold and platinum, and has been in the making for three years. One Malaysian businessman is purchasing the yacht, despite the fact that when the gold hits the seawater, it will not look too pretty. As such, Stuart Hughes is creating the yacht, which will have a deck, dining area, rails, anchor, all crafted from precious metals. The base of the yacht is wrapped in a thin layer of gold, with the main sleeping quarter having platinum accents with walls set in meteoric stone, that has genuine T-Rex bone shavings on it. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:This is incredibly bullish for precious metals, as someone with enough disposable income has decided to spend nearly $5 billion to build something that is probably going to get destroyed due to the seawater. Buy gold ETFs, such as SPDR GOLd ETF (NYSE: GLD), Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) if you believe that gold is likely to go much higher. Another way to play it is due to the large amount of platinum in the yacht, platinum prices are sharply higher. Consider buying ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) if you believe that platinum will continue to move higher. Bearish:This is an incredibly stupid purchase, and this mysterious Malayasian business man needs to have his head examined. Despite concerns over the debt ceiling, European debt woes and the general health of the global economy, spending $4.8 billion on a gold plated yacht seems pretty dumb.

2011-07-21,How To Play A 20% Rise In Gold In 3 Months,"FX Concepts' John Taylor was on Bloomberg TV yesterday and he said that he sees gold at $1,900 at October, which is a 20% rise in just three months. Here is a link courtesy of ZeroHedge that has the interview with Taylor on Bloomberg talking about what he foresees happening later this year. After that sharp run up, Taylor said he sees gold plunging to $1,100 an ounce as another recession hits the globe, which Taylor believes will be worse than 2008. Talk about being optimistic. Taylor said that he sees the Euro going as low as $1.15 this year, and may hit parity with the U.S. dollar, although Taylor has made that call before. Taylor has been notoriously bearish on the economic policies of the U.S. and Europe, and is generally regarded as one of the best forex traders on the planet. Interestingly enough, he runs the largest FX hedge fund in the world. Taylor has been incredibly bearish for some time, and predicted a lot of the problems that Europe is currently experiencing in a Bloomberg conference at the end of last year. He has been worried about the problems of the PIIGS, and we saw today that Greece essentially has to have a Marshall plan to help save it, and even this plan may not save it. Taylor believes that the U.S. is running out of time and options to prevent a slowdown, and Europe is likely to fall with it in the coming months. Gold has long been a safe haven currency, despite what federal reserve Chairmen Ben Bernanke thinks. With a looming debt crisis of our own, gold has crossed the $1,600 mark, and if Taylor is right, could see another run to $1,900 an ounce before too long. If S&P actually does downgrade U.S. debt to AA next month should a deal on the deficit and debt ceiling not be done, then mass chaos would happen in the global asset markets, and gold and silver probably would see record inflows, inline with Taylor's thinking. Despite his considerable bearishness, Taylor has been wrong before, as he has said before the Euro would go to $1.20, and it has not hit that level yet. He is probably right to continue to be bearish on the U.S. dollar, as Bernanke and the rest of the FOMC are hellbent on doing whatever they can to destroy the purchasing power of the dollar in an effort to stimulate the economy. QE1 and QE2 have done little but raise equity prices, cause inflation, and perhaps make add a few jobs, although no one can really quantify how many jobs have been saved or added thanks to the Federal Reserve's policies. So how should you play Taylor's theory that gold will run 20% in the next few months? ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that gold is likely to soar as Taylor suggests might want to consider the following trades:Go long junior gold miners, such as Hecla Mining (NYSE: HL), Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) or the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). If gold jumps, these names are likely to do better than larger gold miners. If you do not want the volatility that comes with owning smaller miners, consider owning the Market Vectors Gold Etf Trust (NYSE: GDX), which owns larger miners, and is less volatile. Silver should also do well in this scenario, and names like First Majestic Silver Corp. (NYSE: AG) will do well. Bearish:Traders who believe that the U.S. dollar is likely to continue to fall may consider alternate positions:Shorting the U.S. dollar, either by shorting PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP), or going long PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bearish (NYSE: UDN).

2011-07-29,Moody's Thinking About Screwing With Spain Next,"Moody's Investors Service said Friday it might cut Spain's credit rating soon, and few in Madrid are going to be happy with that thought. Then again, it's unclear whether the idea to cut Spain's rating can really qualify as a thought, given the logic behind it. Moody's has said the downgrade would come because Moody's is concerned about the rising cost of borrowing money to pay down Spanish debt. Of course, downgrading the credit rating has exactly one outcome: it raises the cost of borrowing money to pay down debt. If this is not an epic facepalm moment (ask your kids) then I do not know what would qualify as one. Spain's current long-term rating sits at Aa2, and the decrease would only bump it down one notch. Still, why cut the debt rating now, particularly when Spain has met its 2010 targets and is otherwise recovering? Cutting the debt rating would only serve to make it more likely that Spain has trouble in 2011 and beyond. What is Moody's argument? “Funding costs have been rising for some time for the Spanish government and for many closely related debt issuers, such as domestic banks and regional governments,” Moody's said. “Pressures are likely to increase still further following the announcement of the official package for Greece, which has signaled a clear shift in risk for bondholders of countries with high debt burdens or large budget deficits.” Moody's continued, “Challenges to long-term budget balance remain due to Spain's subdued economic growth and fiscal slippage within parts of its regional and local government sector.” Spain is also, officially, on the right path. Wages have been cut. Subsidies have been cut, and voila! It's still not good enough for the banking cartel. (I sincerely hope the austerity hawks here in America are paying attention to the fact that Spain cut back on social spending and drove the country further into recession, shrinking the economy...which is what will happen here if they get their way.) Either way, Moody's isn't looking to make a move for at least three months. They just figured now was a good time to remind Spain that even doing everything you've agreed to do isn't enough to keep the vultures from your still-living-torso. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish: The continued debt saga in Europe is pushing gold prices through the roof along with other macroeconomic headwinds. There is absolutely no obvious reason why this cannot continue. Investors should have precious metals exposure through ETFs such as SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), and and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE: GDXJ). Bearish: Traders wishing to bet against Spain, could buy ProShares UltraShort MSCI Europe (NYSE: EPV), short iShares MSCI Spain Index (NYSE: EWP), or short Spanish bank Banco Santander, (NYSE: STD)."
2011-07-29,"Hello Darkness, My Old Friend","Hello darkness, my old friend-Simon & Garfunkel This morning we saw second quarter GDP come in much weaker than expected, as the economy grew 1.3% annualized in the second quarter. Expectations were for a reading of 1.7%. The real kick in the pants was the revision to first quarter GDP which was revised to 0.4% from an initial reading of 1.9%. We saw revisions to previous quarters that were so sharp it made your heard turn. The Commerce Department said the economy contracted 5.1% between the fourth quarter of 2007 and the second quarter of 2009. It was initially estimated that the contract was 4.1%. If you really want to take some Pepto Bismol this morning, the economy fell 8.9% annually in the fourth quarter of 2008, the worst in 50 years. That was not a recession folks, that was a Great Depression of a magnitude of the likes most of us have never seen in our lifetimes. The economy actually decline 0.3% in 2008, as opposed to being flat. All of the revisions included retail sales from the Census Bureau, which were not in the original numbers. In 2009, the economy fell 3.5%, much worse than the original 2.6% decline that was previously estimated. On the bright side, the economy grew faster than expected, growing at a rate of 3%, compared to the 2.9% previously reported. Despite this better than expected news, we are awash in a sea of negativity, as nothing seems to be going right this morning. It is nothing more than a harrowed mess that appears to be a rolling stone. Speaker of the House John Boehner's (R-OH) planned vote was cancelled last night because he could not get the required 218 votes needed to pass his plan. His own party is against him, and there are deep structural problems within the Republican party. The Tea Party subset is really making things difficult for the Republicans. The Democratic led Senate is trying to get something done, and Harry Reid (D-NV) said this morning, We have hours to act before a default happens. We are less than 100 hours away from defaulting, and it does not look like anything is going to get resolved today. Perhaps there will be a last minute compromise between both parties, but it does not look like it, at least as of right now. The Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury are making contingency plans for a potential U.S. default, and they are meeting with primary dealers today at the New York Fed to discuss the plans. We will see details leak out as the day happens, but it may do more harm than good, as the devil is always in the details. With a weak Q2 GDP, the potential for a U.S. default and a potential double dip recession, Simon & Garfunkel's song has never been more appropriate. At least since 2008. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that the Federal Reserve will enact a QE3 to try to save the day might want to consider the following trades:With a weak Q2 GDP, and the potential for a weaker than expected July jobs report, the odds on a QE3 appear to be increasing. Agricultural stocks, like Potash Corp. (NYSE: POT), CF Industries (NYSE: CF) should do well. Consider agricultural ETFs like PowerShares DB Agriculture Fund (NYSE: DBA) and Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO) as well. Other commodity related names should do well, such as Gold ETFs, like Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) and Market Vectors Gold Etf Trust (NYSE: GDX).Bearish:Traders who believe that QE3 will happen may consider alternate positions:The middle class will be crushed, as will the U.S. dollar, and both will be on the precipice of ceasing to exist as we know them. QE3 will kill the middle class, with gasoline prices soaring, and food costs spiraling out of control. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results.

2011-08-01,Manufacturing Growth Hits 2-Year Low,"Manufacturing data fell again in July, giving ammunition to the thesis that the economy is turning back toward recession. The Institute for Supply Management, a purchasing executives trade group, said Monday that its index of manufacturing activity fell to 50.9 percent in July, barely registering as growth. Any number above 50 percent works out to growth; the higher the number, the more the sector is growing. Overall, the manufacturing sector did reports its 23rd straight month of growth — the exact amount of time that the economy has been officially out of recession. Despite the growth, new sales orders were down sharply, and other numbers from the survey suggest that the current quarter may yield bad results. The ISM manufacturing report for July is a shocker and strongly suggests that the disappointing performance of the economy in the first half of the year was not just temporary, said Paul Dales, a senior U.S. economist for Capital Economics. Overall, it has been a rough few months for manufacturing. The Japanese earthquake/tsunami/nuclear holocaust led to a parts shortage, disrupting automakers' supply chains, cutting into the output of new cars. High gas prices left Americans stranded with few dollars to spend on discretionary items. Employers have responded to the downturn predictably, pulling back on hiring. The economy added just 18,000 net jobs in June, the fewest number of jobs in nearly nine months. Unemployment rose to 9.2 percent. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish: It is hard to see how this is bullish for much of anything, except probably gold. Investors could consider gold-based ETFs such as (NYSE: GLD), (NYSE: GDX), and (NYSE: GDXJ). Bearish: The stock market is starting to signal that the economy is facing serious headwinds. Traders looking for more downside could buy inverse ETFs such as ProShares UltraShort S&P (NYSE: SDS), ProShares UltraShort Russell2000 (NYSE: TWM) and ProShares UltraShort QQQ (NYSE: QID)."
2011-08-02,"Short USD, Short EUR, But Buy Gold, Equities, Cigs, and Whiskey","FRANKFURT - I've proven that even a fool can make a lot of money in the market. I've also proven that a foole and his money is soone parted. This morning, I was sitting outside of a café on Berger Straße, sipping on a latte and pretending my pen was a cigarette. I watched high-end branded mothers push past with homunculi in thousand euro baby carriages; I saw hipsters and bald men, summer-kissed girls and women, and everybody appeared to have a sunny disposition save I. I was thinking, Who was going to save me and my money? Wasn't anyone else worried about Greek Bailout Part I, Part II, ad infinitum? Didn't any of them see that Portugal, Ireland, Italy, and Spain were already standing in line? That there was a contest between the ECB and the Fed to see which could pump out the most paper? Perhaps I wasn't enjoying the sunshine because I made the mistake of viewing a few hours of C-SPAN's coverage of The Debt Ceiling the day before. It was as if reverse-evolution was at work: congresspersons have near the same intelligence as an amoeba. And their grip on reality is equal to that of a teenager who has swallowed a tab of acid. The Debt Ceiling was a farce because everybody knew what the outcome was going to be. The only solution to the economic problems in the US and Europe is to keep printing. It is a race to the bottom between the US dollar and the euro, and we may see a short-term bounce in the US dollar because, as The Renewable Man says, When you print, your currency invariable goes up short term. I am not interested in playing the US dollar, but an investors wishing to go long the U.S. dollar can buy PowerShares DB USD Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP). To short the euro, investors can buy the 2x leveraged Market Vectors Double Short Euro ETN (NYSE: DRR) or the 2x leveraged ProShares UltraShort Euro (NYSE: EUO). I believe I will use a strengthening US dollar to buy some real assets with my FRNs, such as gold, cigarettes, and whiskey. If TSHTF, I'm sure I can trade a cig or a shot for a meal. It might seem odd that I am contemplating going into equities after this current downturn, but it is not, if you consider that unlimited paper has to go somewhere. Don't forget, Helicopter Ben's QE3 is also coming this month. There is nothing to be gained in government bonds (miniscule interest and then, of a sudden, they will die), so paper will move to equities to keep pace with inflation. This strategy works if TS does not HTF and the gains, in real terms, will likely not amount to much, but after buying one ton of gold, there is only so much tobacco and whiskey a man can store. Trusting paper holds for a few more years, you can play gold by picking up SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD). You might also want to look at the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Investors who want to bet the market will rise, can buy SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) or Rydex 2x S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: RSU) which seeks to correspond to twice (200%) the inverse of the daily performance of the S&P 500 Index. Another bullish play could be ProShares Ultra QQQ (NYSE: QLD), which seeks to return twice the daily performance of the NASDAQ-100 Index. I will never look at C-SPAN again. That is more depressing than a depression. If you have any tips for me or want to send me gold, contact me at ramon.lewis.benzinga@gmail.com."
2011-08-02,"Hey Ben, Gold Is Money Whether You Like It Or Not","Despite claims from the all mighty Bernank that gold is not money, gold has been rising at an accelerated rate in recent trading session on concerns over any number of different reasons. Weaker than expected economic growth. The debt ceiling potentially not being raised. The possibility of default. Europe sovereign debt crisis du jour. All of this has led to $1,600+ an ounce gold that looks like a run away freight train. “Increasing the debt ceiling is not going to make the debt go away, while the debt problems in Europe aren't going to be resolved overnight, and we're seeing all these getting reflected in the weaker economic numbers,” said Zhang Yingying, an analyst at brokerage Galaxy Futures Co. to Bloomberg. Gold has climbed to levels not seen ever in both New York and London trading, and if we continue to see weak economic data from the U.S., as well as abroad, there could be no stopping the gold train. Yesterday, the July ISM data was released, and it came in well below expectations, at a reading of just above 50, 50.9. Expectations were for a reading over 54. Over 50 indicates economic expansion, but just barely. “All the ongoing economic uncertainty and fears of a downgrade of the U.S. AAA sovereign rating are gold supportive,” Andrey Kryuchenkov, an analyst at VTB Capital in London, wrote in a report. “Weak macro numbers would also delay the tightening cycle in the U.S.” Gold actually dipped yesterday after the House of Representatives passed a bill raise the U.S. debt limit and cut federal spending, with the Senate voting on the bill today. That was no matter, and gold is zooming again this morning, up another $19 an ounce this morning. So far, gold is up 15% this year, up eleven years in a row. We have seen calls for $2,000 an ounce by the end of the year. Jim Rogers, noted investor and U.S. dollar bear, has said that gold will continue to soar on the policies of the U.S. government. Gary Halverson, regional Australia-Pacific president at Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE: ABX), said that prices are “well-supported at current levels”. We continue to see strong demand, from both foreign central banks, retail investors, and speculators. In fact, The Bank of Korea bought 25 tons over a one-month period from June to July for the first time since 1998. We are also moving into the Indian gold buying season, and there is no reason to think that India, with its population of nearly 1 billion, will slow down its demand. Despite what Federal Reserve Chairmen Ben Bernanke thinks, gold is money. Just ask Ron Paul what he thinks. There are serious inflows going into the precious metal and it does not look like it is going to stop anytime soon. As such, traders need to be prepared for the precious metal to hit $2,000 an ounce, and perhaps beyond. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that the U.S. economy will fall apart might want to consider the following trades:Go long everything gold you can get your hands on. Gold coins. Bars. ETFs such as SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD), Market Vectors Etf Trust (NYSE: GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). If everything comes crashing down at once, there is no telling where gold will go. Bearish:Traders who believe that the U.S. economy is likely to recover faster than anyone expects may consider alternate positions:Since gold is well above previous highs, it may correct sharply, especially if economic data gets better now that Washington has their act together (for the moment, anyway). Shorting the aforementioned names could prove to be profitable. High beta names such as Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), Green Mountain (NASDAQ: GMCR) and others could move higher if the economy gets better.

2011-08-02,"Auto, Truck Sales Data Due Out at 3 pm Eastern","Two key economic figures are due out at 3:00 EST Tuesday, and traders are eagerly awaiting both to see how the market might react in late-day trading. The Monthly Auto and Truck Sales figures are each scheduled to be released this afternoon, providing a glimpse into how well auto and truck manufacturers did in July. The expectations are 4.1 million sales for autos and 5.2 million sales for trucks. Last month, autos came in at 3.86 million while trucks were in at 4.98 million. Clearly, the markets are expecting an uptick from last month. But will they get it? And what will happen if they miss? The Dow is already down huge today, so perhaps good data will show up as a late-day reversal. Conversely, will bad data lead to a continuation of its slump downward today? Early reports are not very positive. General Motors missed their mark, coming in at a 6% increase rather than 7%. That could well hold the overall numbers down, considering how they are calculated. Each auto maker reports sales individually. The reports are typically released over the course of the first three business days of the month. Using the individual reports, a total annual sales pace can be calculated after applying Commerce Department seasonal factors. It is this annual sales pace that the market refers to when discussing auto and truck sales for the month. Auto and Truck Sales measure the monthly sales of all domestically produced vehicles. They are considered an important indicator of consumer demand, accounting for roughly 25% of total retail sales. Demand for big ticket items such as autos and trucks tends to be interest rate sensitive, making the motor vehicle sector a leading indicator of business cycles. In other words, if the data come in short of expectations, we may see more panic selling. However, even if they hit their mark, there is no guarantee that stocks will rise. Why? Because, as I mentioned, the market is down big...and no one can really explain why. Look at the greater political movement. Wall Street got a big win today, as the debt ceiling debacle passed. The manufactured crisis was averted. Wall Street avoided tax increases, which were on the table, and spending cuts, which mostly went to programs that help poor people. By all political measures, today should have been a coke-fueled bonanza on Wall Street. And yet, the market is down 150 points right now. Economic data from earlier in the day certainly doesn't indicate that level of sell off is warranted. Construction spending exceeded expectations, and personal income met expectations. Personal spending was underwater, but given the income data it suggests that perhaps people are socking a little more cash away for a late-summer trip. Either that, or perhaps we're due for a dip in consumer confidence and perhaps another recession. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that auto sales numbers are on the rise might want to consider the following trades: Any of the automaker stocks, including General Motors (NYSE: GM) and Ford (NYSE: F) Rising auto sales indicate a good economy, which could point you in the direction of market ETFs like the S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) or the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE: DIA). Bearish:Traders who believe that auto sales are down and the economy is headed down with them may consider an alternate positions:Short any of the bullish positions.It may seem risky, considering the boost the commodity has taken in the last year, but perhaps buying gold in any form would be a good idea. Look to gold ETFs like (NYSE: GLD), (NYSE: GDX), and (NYSE: GDXJ), which offer varying levels of risk and reward. Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-08-08,"Gold Takes Out $1,700 and Keeps Going Up in Asia","FRANKFURT - Gold burst through $1,700 an ounce in Asia on Monday as investors dropped riskier assets and ran to the safety of the ancient currency. Markets were sharply down in Asia in the first day of trading after Standard & Poor's downgraded the sovereign debt rating of the US to AA+ from AAA. Jim Sinclair, known as Mr. Gold, wrote on his blog that the next target for gold is $1,764 with $1,784 being the gate to an entirely new phase. Looking at a one year chart, gold has climbed from $1,197 an ounce to the new high reached today in Asia of over $1,715, a jump of approximately 43%. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Sunday, Considering the momentum in which the market went down over the last week, it is very unlikely, if history is any guide, that this isn't going to take a while to bottom out, on NBC's Meet The Press program. If there is a further selloff in equities in Europe and the US later in the day, investors should expect gold to move even higher. It might be time to batten down the hatches and buy gold, cigs and whiskey. Depending on how you see it, there are a few ways to play gold and the dollar on Monday. ACTION ITEMS: Bullish: Traders who believe that gold will go higher might want to consider the following trades: Play gold by picking up SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which seeks to replicate the price and yield performance of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), which seeks to replicate the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners index Bearish: Traders who believe that gold will drop sharply after this spike may consider these alternate positions: PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) ProShares UltraShort Gold (NYSE: GLL) Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-08-08,Are Shares Of Gold Miners A Steal At These Levels?,"FRANKFURT - Gold has hit a fresh record high today of over $1,719 an ounce, its 11th record high in the last 19 trading sessions. Shares of most unhedged gold miners, however, are far from their all-time highs and well below their 52-week highs. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), for example, though up nearly 5% today, would still have to rise over 15% to approach its 52-week high. Barrick, the biggest gold miner in the world, is actually down approximately 10% year-to-date. This is at odds with SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD), the gold trust that seeks to replicate the price of gold, which is up nearly 20% year-to-date. The Amex Gold BUGS Index, also known as the HUI Index and listed on the American Stock exchange, is well off its 52-week high as well. The HUI index tracks 15 of the largest and most widely held unhedged public gold miners. Barrick is the largest component of the index, and a close second in the index is Goldcorp (NYSE: GG), another unhedged miner that has risen over 5% today but again, is also well off its highs. Another favorite unhedged miner, Agnico-Eagle Mines (NYSE: AEM), is off by nearly 23% year-to-date, and once more, that is after rising over 5% today. An investor could do very well buying unhedged miners if they believe gold will continue setting records. As Reuters has reported, Dominic Schneider, an analyst at UBS Wealth Management, said today that UBS had increased its price target to $1,800, adding, but I would say the way things evolve right now I really could even imagine $2,000 being in the cards. The chances have increased that we'll reach $2,000--the forecast remains 12-month $1,800, but the risk is that we will actually hit towards $2,000. If miners play catch up, they could easily outperform gold in the months ahead. Traders who believe that gold and unhedged gold miners will go higher might want to consider the following trades: Play gold by picking up SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which seeks to replicate the price and yield performance of the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), which seeks to replicate the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners index Buy shares of Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Agnico-Eagle Mines (NYSE: AEM) Bearish: Traders who believe that gold will drop sharply after this spike may consider these alternate positions: PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ) ProShares UltraShort Gold (NYSE: GLL) Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-08-08,"1,700 Ways To Say I Love You","If you loved gold at $1,600 an ounce, you have to love it at $1,700 an ounce. This morning, gold crossed the $1,700 level and it looks as if there is no stopping the precious metal, after S&P downgraded U.S. debt amongst fiscal problems, and continued problems in Europe. Gold is a run away freight train at this point, and there is the potential that we could see $2,000 an ounce, and perhaps even $2,500 if Europe really blows up. This morning, Goldman Sachs raised its price target for gold to $1,860 an ounce by the end of the year, and J.P. Morgan said it could potentially hit $2,500 an ounce if a catastrophe happens. On Friday, S&P announced it had downgraded U.S. debt to AA+, from AAA. This is the first time in the country's history that our debt has been downgrade, and it does not look like we will be able to get it back anytime soon. The average country takes nine to eighteen years for it to be up upgraded, if it is upgraded at all. With the downgrade of U.S. debt, we are seeing money flow into gold and silver like never before. S&P asked for $4 trillion in cuts, it got $2.1 trillion and more fighting in Congress than any of us ever imagined. It was embarrassing to watch, and even more embarrassing to be an American. Gold is up over $40 an ounce as of the time of this writing, and it looks like this is a week for gold to explode to the upside if there ever was one. The economy is weakening, no doubt, due in large part to the devastation that happened in Japan. Automakers, semiconductor companies, and a host of other tech companies have all said they experienced a sharp slowdown as a result of the world's third largest economy contracting due to the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. As a result, we have seen economic numbers slow to a halt in the U.S., although the July jobs report was a bright spot in a sea full of red. This week we could see even more gains in gold, if the Federal Reserve announces or even mentions a third round of quantitative easing. Ever since the minutes from the June Federal Reserve meeting were released on July 12, gold, as well as silver have been jumping. If the Fed and Chairmen Ben Bernanke do decide to do additional easing, the U.S. dollar would continue to depreciate, triggering a flight to precious metals. This could potentially pave the way for $2,000 gold. There are still worries about Europe and Italy in particular. Italy is almost too big to save, and with over $2 trillion in debt, it could bring down the European Union as know it. Last night, the European Central Bank announced it would be buying Spanish and Italian debt, but that did nothing to assuage fears. We may not see $2,500 gold tomorrow or next year, but if we see more easing and continued worries about defaults, the streets are not going to be paved with asphalt anymore. The streets will be paved with gold. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that gold is likely to continue to climb might want to consider the following trades:If traders do not want single equity exposure, they may want to consider ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD), which tracks the price of gold. Other ETFs to consider are Market Vectors Gold Etf Trust (NYSE: GDX [FREE Stock Trend Analysis]) or Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ).Bearish:Traders who believe that there will be a pullback and equities will move higher may consider alternate positions:Go long high beta equities, like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), ARM Holdings (NASDAQ: ARMH), and others.

2011-08-08,Thanks S&P  08-08-2011,"Cusick's Corner Standard & Poor's has done what they said they were going to do -- downgrade the US and Government home lending agencies. After looking at the EU's efforts that will hold up Spain and Italy, it is hard to imagine that with the Fed meeting this week and the fact that our politicians now see their butts on the line, that they will not come to the table to quell the fear that is in the market. This may be the buying opportunity that my kids or those who are 20 years away from retirement may not see for a while, so how can anyone play this way oversold move? Bulls may want to consider selling puts in names that they would love to own in their long-term portfolio, I heavily stress the concept of underlyings they want to actually own. Short-term bounce bulls could buy out-of-the-money call butterflies; use August options if you are anticipating a bounce into expiration or September options if you want time. Cooler heads will prevail. See you Midday. Global equity markets are back under pressure after Standard & Poor's downgraded the US triple-A credit rating late-Friday. In their first chance to react to the downgrade, markets traded lower across Asia and Europe before the opening bell on Wall Street Monday. Then, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled at the open on concerns about the potential longer-term implications for the US and the economy from the downgrade. The ratings cut has completely overshadowed any other news of the day. Crude oil is also under pressure and has given up another $3.59 to $83.29 per barrel. However, gold has surged to record highs and was recently up $61.8 to $1712 an ounce. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 322 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 96.5. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) hit a morning high of 40.96 and was recently up 6.78 to 38.78. Trading in the options market remains very active, with 7.11 million calls and 9.9 million puts traded so far. Bullish Flow Human Genome Sciences (HGSI) is down 63 cents to $15.18 and today's options volume of 33,000 calls and 1,500 puts is more than 3X the average daily volume for the biotech. The top trades of the day are part of a spread, in which the investor was apparently buying January 16 calls on HGSI for $2.25 and $2.30 per contract and selling January 24 calls at 54 and 57 cents. The spread, for a net debit of about $1.70, has traded 12,000X and appears to be opening activity. If so, this strategist is probably looking for HGSI to erase some of its recent losses and move into the mid-20s through January 2012. The stock is down almost 40 percent during the past month. It was trading at $24.50 one month ago. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners Fund (GDXJ) is up 81 cents to $33.54 amid relative strength in the gold mining sector after yellow metal surged to new record highs. Gold gained $61.8 to $1712 an ounce after nervous investors flocked to the metals market Monday. Silver jumped $1.19 to $39.40. Meanwhile, options action in GDXJ is brisk today. 19,000 calls and 4,540 puts traded in the ETF so far. September 38 calls, which are 13.3 percent out-of-the-money and expiring in 39 days, are the most actives. 7,400 traded. Aug 29, Aug 34 and Sep 30 calls are seeing brisk trading as well. Bearish Flow Research In Motion (RIMM) is falling to new 52-week lows today amid active trading in the options on the Blackberry-maker. 111,000 puts and 29,000 puts traded in the name so far. The top trades are part of a spread, in which the investor sold more than 36,000 January 24 puts at $4.825 per contract and bought more than 49,000 January 21puts at $3.25. Shares are down $1.49 to $21.90 and the spread is probably a roll - or closing out a winning position in in-the-money RIMM Jan 24 puts to buy a new larger position in out-of-the-money Jan 21 puts. A shareholder might have initiated the trade to adjust a hedge. Quicksilver Resources (KWK) is reeling today, even after the Fort Worth, TX oil and gas company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenues. The company reported a 7-cent per share quarterly profit on $248 million in revenues. Analysts were looking for 5 cents on $218 million. Still, shares are down $1.98 to $9.77. Options volume is 5X the average daily. 7,150 calls and 360 puts traded in the name. September $10 puts are the most actives. 6,430 have changed hands, and with 74 percent trading at the ask and open interest of just 46 contracts, it looks like some investors are taking new bearish positions and bracing for additional losses in KWK in the weeks ahead. Unusual Volume SPDR Retail Trust (XRT) options volume is running 2X the (22-day) average, with 79,000contracts traded and put activity accounting for 90 percent of the volume. SPDR Financials (XLF) options volume is 2.5X the average daily, with 793,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 84 percent of the activity. CREE options volume is running 3X the average daily, with 69,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 69 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Genworth (GNW), Weatherford (WFT), and Human Genome Sciences (HGSI). Implied Volatility Mover CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) rallied early to seize the 40 handle for the first time since May of 2010. VIX surged at the open after the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) faltered on news that Standard & Poor's had downgraded US debt. The S&P, which lost 7.1 percent the week before, is down another 44.94 to 1,154.44. Meanwhile, VIX, which tracks the expected volatility priced into SPX options, surged to 40.96. The volatility index is now up 6.88 to 38.88 amid high volume in the VIX options pit. 286,000 calls and 106,000 puts traded in the product so far. Aug 40 calls, which expire in just 8 days, are the most actives. 42,180 traded."

2011-08-10,"Why Gold Is Going To $2,000 An Ounce By The End Of August","This morning, gold crossed the $1,800 level and it looks as if there is no stopping the precious metal, and we could see $2,000 by the end of the month at this rate. There is a crisis of confidence around the world, and when there is a crisis of confidence, people freak out. When people freak out, everything is sold, whether it deserves to be sold or not. Rock solid names like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and others are being sold with companies that will not be around in three years. No one knows for sure what the earnings will be on these companies, whereas just a few short weeks ago, confidence was not fleeting. As such, when you get a crisis of confidence, money all piles into one place: precious metals, particularly, gold. Gold has soared over $300 in almost a months time. That used to be a year's move, and not all in one direction either. After S&P downgraded U.S. debt, the fear level was set to Extreme, and panic started around the world. For those who are saying this is not like 2008, you are right and wrong. You are right in the sense that corporations are in much better places than they were just three short years ago. Corporate balance sheets are spectacular. However, consumer, investor, and business confidence is where it was in 2008. You need confidence for markets to function properly. Good news, bad news, or no news, markets can handle that and function properly, most of the time. When you sap confidence, it is a very different story. Nobody believes the government anymore, and no one believes the banks. Just this morning, rumor mongers were saying that Societe Generale could be on the verge of bankruptcy. Obviously this did not happen, but we are seeing this happen in Italy, starting to see it in France, and every so often, we hear German banks being caught up in the rumor mill. With S&P downgrading the U.S. debt, it sapped confidence across the world, and markets across the world fell sharply. Besides this, we have a weakening economy, Congress has shown no inclination to act and provide fiscal stimulus, and Japan is still rebounding from the devastation saw in March. There are still worries about Europe and Greece in particular, according to said Joe Foster, portfolio manager for the Van Eck Global International Investors Gold Fund to CNN back in July. Greece is sort of on the verge of default and they're still trying to figure out how to engineer a recovery for Greece without inflicting a default on the country [and] the markets are sensing that's almost impossible, he said to CNN Money. Until the situation is resolved in these peripheral countries, it's going to drive gold. Italy, with its over $2 trillion in debt is going to be a problem for a very long time. It will be until either the European Financial Stability Fund is operational, or it is allowed to restructure its debt, and bond holders take a hair cut. There is no magic solution for a country as large as Italy, whether you want to believe it or not. When you have a crisis of confidence, everyone heads for the exit. The only door that is open? Gold. Just do not be surprised when you get to the door, and Ron Paul is the one opening it for you. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that confidence will continue to be fleeting in the short term might want to consider the following trades: Buying gold miners such as Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Hecla Mining (NYSE: HL) or Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY) could prove to be profitable as gold soars to new highs. If traders do not want single equity exposure, they may want to consider ETFs, such as SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD), which tracks the price of gold. Other ETFs to consider are Market Vectors Gold ETF Trust (NYSE: GDX) or Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Bearish:Traders who believe that investor confidence will come back sooner rather than later may consider alternate positions:If confidence comes back from some outside force, equities could soar. Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) etc. all could soar from these levels. Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2011-08-22,Don't Forget About This Gold Miners ETF,"In case you didn't get the memo, after months of underperformance relative to spot gold prices, ETFs that track gold miners are finally starting to act right. In recent weeks, perhaps the worst thing that can be said of these ETFs is that they are performing “less bad” than the broader market and in a display of their underlying strength, some of these ETFs even rise slightly on wicked down days for the broader market. And as we are seeing today, gold miner ETFs also outperform on up days. That's only part of the good news. The other part is the discussion on gold miner ETFs does not begin and end with the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Simply put, now is not the time to be ignoring the Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG). “Quad G” flies under the radar because GDX has almost $8.7 billion in assets under management, dominating the large-cap mining ETF space. GDXJ is no slouch with almost $2.5 billion in AUM, but there is room in this niche for GGGG to thrive. GGGG, which made its debut in March and is home to 30 stocks with nearly $3.9 million in AUM, is just starting to perk up. Up nearly 5% in the past week, GGGG's gains have been made on above average volume, perhaps indicating investors are finally starting to take a look at this unheralded mining ETF. While GGGG isn't the most well-known mining ETF that doesn't mean it's speculative. Canada, South Africa, the U.S. and Australia account for roughly 72% of the new ETF's country weights and that diversity actually trumps its more popular rivals while offering the same conservative geographic posture. In other words, it's a good idea to embrace mining ETFs with North America and Australia exposure and GGGG offers plenty of that. Investors can also rest easy knowing major gold miners such as El Dorado (NYSE: EG), Kinross (NYSE: KGC) and Gold Fields (NYSE: GFI) are found among GGGG's top-10 holdings. With no signs that gold's run is going to end in the near-term, GGGG is offering some value here as it remains a fair bit off its all-time high. A move above $17 puts the ETF in breakout mode, a move that cannot be ruled as spot gold's rising tide lifts the sails of mining ETFs."

Traders can watch for intra-day support around the $36.85 level. Should the GDXJ rally or trade higher on the session the next important intra-day resistance level is around the $38.00 area. The daily chart for the GDXJ remains in good technical shape by trading above the daily chart 50 and 200 moving averages.

2011-09-08,Check Out The Chart: Junior Gold Miners Looking Bullish,"In this special edition of “Check Out The Chart,” we're going back to the well (or the mine) with an ETF that we touted several weeks ago, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). As we previously noted, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF and its larger cousin, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) spent plenty of time lagging spot gold prices earlier this year. Fortunately, the charts show us that scenario has changed. In fact, a look at the chart of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF shows the ETF has cleared some stiff resistance at $38. That's bullish sign Number One. Bullish sign Number Two would come in the form of that old resistance turning into new support in the event of a pullback. Should $38 turn into new support, that area becomes an ideal entry point or a place to do some dollar-cost averaging. The other scenario to consider with the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF is that gold will crack stiff resistance of its own around $1,900 an ounce, meaning a small position in GDXJ is advisable here and now. Looking at the chart, the ETF has a clear runway back to resistance at $42. If the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF can break that area on strong volume, the 52-week high at $42.97 will fall as well and the ETF could run another $3-$5 from there. There's something else to consider: In the past month, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), which is backed by physical gold, is up almost 6%. Impressive, but the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF is higher by 12.4% and that's NOT including Thursday's move higher. Check out the chart."
2011-09-12,Four ETFs With Surprisingly High Yields,"The dividend yield on the S&P 500? Hardly worth your time. The yield on 30-year Treasuries? Sitting near multi-decade lows. Sounds like a dire situation for yield-starved investors, but there's no need to fret because there's a fair amount of ETFs out there currently offering noteworthy yields and some of them are surprise candidates for the “high yield” classification. Heading into Monday's trading, over 70 ETFs sported dividend yields above 5%, according to Finviz data. Here are a few that investors may be overlooking as high yield plays. Market Vectors Junior Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ): With their high cost of doing business, even the largest gold miners usually aren't viewed as preferred dividend destinations. Usually, the same can be said of small-cap gold miners, too, but the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF looks like an exception to that rule. Monday's doldrums aside, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF has been solid as of late and with a current yield of 7.65%, the ETF offers an alluring mix of yield and potential capital appreciation. iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ): Yes, we've been bearish on Brazil and the ETF's that track the South American country for a while now and see no reason to change that view at the moment. However, the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund is offering a juicy 5.6% yield at the moment. Normally, the combination of that yield and the growth potential offered by Brazil would be an invitation to get involved here. Problem is, EWZ's yield could easily rise in the coming weeks. That means the ETF has more downside in it. Guggenheim Shipping ETF (NYSE: SEA): The appearance of the Guggenheim Shipping ETF on this list may not be a stunner for followers of the dry bulk shipping sector. It's pretty easy to explain. Rising fears regarding global economic growth have pressured day rates and demand for dry bulk shippers. On the surface, SEA's 7.2% yield looks inviting. The ETF's chart tells a different story as this is one of the worst-performing sector ETFs thus far in 2011. Guggenheim International Multi-Asset ETF (NYSE: HGI): With a current yield of almost 5.6%, the Guggenheim International Multi-Asset ETF would certainly be a more viable option in the near-term the Guggenheim Shipping ETF and maybe more so than the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund. HGI focuses on master limited partnerships, royalty trusts, REITs, foreign stocks and closed-end funds, so it's a legitimate dividend destination. Watch support at $16 before jumping in."
2011-10-14,Five ETFs That Can Reclaim Their Mendoza Lines,"Earlier this year, we took a look at five ETFs that were trading below their Mendoza Lines, or their 200-day moving averages. It's convenient that the Mendoza Line, a baseball term, denotes a batting average of .200. Fall below that and it's hard to justify keeping a batter in the majors no matter how flashy his defense is. When it comes to financial markets, a security that slips below its 200-day line is flashing some ominous signals. On the other hand, a stock or ETF that makes its way back above this important indicator is often believed to be showing some bullish signs. These days, there are no shortage of exchange-traded products residing below their 200-day moving averages. Just under 1,000 ETFs and ETNs out of a universe of just over 1,300 currently trade below the all-important 200-day line. With plenty to pick from, we decided to look for five ETFs that stand a reasonably good chance of reclaiming their 200-day lines in the near future. PowerShares Dynamic Food & Beverage Portfolio (NYSE: PBJ): As we noted in our look at next week's ETFs to watch, PBJ is just pennies away from its 200-day line. On a percentage basis, pennies is about 0.8%. With critical earnings reports looming next week, PBJ is a strong candidate to reclaim its 200-day line in the very near-term. Market Vectos Agribusiness ETF (NYSE: MOO): Several factors make the Market Vectors Agribusiness ETF a prime candidate to get back above its Mendoza Line. First, it's just 8.6% away from doing so. Second, this rally has been a boon for high-beta fare such as what is found in MOO. Third, MOO makes for an excellent long-term holding and investors may be starting to realize that below $50, MOO is attractive. iShares MSCI Chile Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: ECH): ECH resides 15.6% below its 200-day moving average as of Friday's close. That sounds like a lot and it is, but the risk/reward here is favorable. ECH can be had around $59 with a stop at $50. Once the 50-day line at $60 falls, there is a lot of room back to the 200-day line at $70. If that falls, we're looking at a return to the high-70s. While not probable, it's not impossible that all of this happens before Christmas. First Trust ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index Fund (NYSE: FCG): At 13.1% below its Mendoza Line, FCG has its work cut out for it. That much is true, but we like the ETF's prospects for capturing that 13% if can get at least of the following three factors to go in its favor: The broader market continues to rally, earnings season is stellar for energy names and energy sector M&A heats up in the current quarter. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ): Yes, 14.6% below the 200-day moving average is nothing to smile about. Then again, we like the historical trends that show miners have a tendency to sharply outperform gold bullion after both sell-off. The sell-off appears to be complete and a return to riskier assets will drive mining shares higher through year-end. GDXJ probably won't jump 14.6% in a week to get back to its 200-day moving average, but it could happen in two or three weeks."
2011-11-04,Direxion Files Plans For 8 New 3X Leveraged ETFs,"Direxion, the second-largest issuer of leveraged and inverse ETFs, has filed plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission for eight new triple-leveraged funds. Among the new funds that Direxion may list are the Direxion Daily Industrial Bull 3X Shares and the Direxion Daily Industrial Bear 3X Shares, which seek results that are 300% and 300% inverse of the Industrial Select Sector Index. That's the same index tracked by the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI). Both funds will carry expense ratios of 0.95%. Tickers were not disclosed in the filings. Direxion has also filed plans for the Direxion Daily Turkey Bull 3X Shares and the Direxion Daily Turkey Bear 3X Shares, the first country-specific leveraged ETFs on Turkey. Those ETFs will track the MSCI Turkey Investable Market Index, the same index followed by the iShares MSCI Turkey Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: TUR). TUR has proven popular with investors and has drawn in $456.3 million in assets under management since its March 2008 debut. The Direxion funds will both have expense ratios of 0.95%. No tickers were disclosed. And if the volatility in the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) isn't enough for you, then Direxion may have the prescription. That is if the Direxion Daily Silver Miners Bull 3X Shares and the Direxion Daily Silver Miners Bear 3X Shares come to market along with the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares and the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares. Those four funds will have fees of 0.95% as well. Direxion currently sponsors leveraged plays on large-cap gold miners, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 2X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 2X Shares (NYSE: DUST). At the end of October, Direxion had 50 ETFs with $7.5 billion in AUM, according to data from the National Stock Exchange."
2011-12-07,Twelve For '12: Sector ETFs to Watch In The New Year ,"It has been a wild ride for investors in 2011, but when all is said and done, the top performers in terms of sector ETFs this year aren't likely to surprise anyone. Well, one might be a surprise, but the others not so much. Using SPDRs as our reference point, we find the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU) is up about 12% year-to-date. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) is up nearly 9%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV) is up about 7% while the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY), the sort of surprise, is up about 5%. All this while the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) is flat year-to-date. With 2012 being an election year, it's possible investors will remain pensive, further boosting the returns of funds like XLP and XLU. Or maybe Europe will get its act together and the U.S. economy will improve to the point where risk on really comes back on. Either way, there are scores of sector funds that will be in the spotlight next year. Here are 12 that could have big things ahead of them in 2012. In no particular order. iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment Index Fund (NYSE: IEZ): The iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment Index Fund's 2011 performance thus far can be viewed in two lights. Impressive that the ETF is only down 1% or depressing that it's down at all considering oil prices remain high by historical standards. The impact of the North American shale boom is arguably priced into many oil services stocks, so IEZ's 2012 fortunes may be more levered to increased demand in international such as Latin America and Russia. One thing to consider: IEZ will not be left behind if oil prices keep climbing. At less than $56 with the potential to see $75 or higher, IEZ looks good here. Global X Uranium ETF (NYSE: URA): We recently argued that things probably can't get any worse for URA. Really, it's hard to imagine that happening. The fundamental out look for the nuclear energy space is strong enough that at less than $9, URA could have savvy investors laughing all the way to the bank next year. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ): There has been a lot of talk of gold miners not performing as well as the yellow metal itself this year. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF is certainly guilty of that. However, what makes GDXJ all the more vexing is that miners have started to get their act together, but in the past three months the ETF is down over 21% while the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is only down 10%. Simply stated, risk on needs to come back on in 2012 to lift GDXJ. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR We just mentioned XLP as one of the top performers among sector ETFs in 2011, but this run might not be in the late innings. Not if 2012 mirrors 2011 even slightly. XLP might be a good play for the first half of 2012 as that's when most of the ETF's large holdings that pay dividends raise those payouts. iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average (NYSE: IYT): With all the economic bellwethers found in this ETF, IYT's fortunes are arguably the market's fortunes. Plus, it's THE ETF for all the Dow theorists out there. Should IYT break support in the $82 area, it could be a bumpy ride for this fund to start 2012. iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (Nasdaq: IBB): We can say one thing for the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF: It has performed quite well this year, up over 9%. And we can say one thing for the biotech sector: There are always trades to be had. Home to 122 stocks, IBB has plenty of buyers and sellers for biotech consolidation, of which there should be some next year. The ETF is a buy if you can get it on a pullback to $95. iShares S&P Global Financials ETF (NYSE: IXG): We could have gone with an ETF that only tracks U.S. banks or one that only tracks non-U.S. banks, but since almost ALL large banks have been stinking up the joint for over a couple of years now, IXG and its 220 stocks make life easy for those that like to be involved with financials. Germany, France and Spain account for 9% of IXG's country weight and unless things change quickly, that will be a problem next year. First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index Fund (Nasdaq: SKYY): Much has been made of niche sector ETFs like the First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index Fund. Critics love to assail these ETFs, saying they're not necessary. Well, someone likes SKYY because it has accumulated over $65 million in assets under management since its July debut. The growth of cloud-computing and the potential for industry consolidation make SKYY an interesting sub-sector play in 2012. Global X Social Media ETF (Nasdaq: SOCL): Talk about a tech ETF that has been under fire, hating on the Global X Social Media ETF is like a sport for some pundits. We beg to differ. With the looming Facebook IPO, SOCL could be legitimized sooner than later. Frankly, this is a sound concept and there's no legitimate reason to bash this fund. If the alpha is there, investors will come. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP): There are lots of energy ETFs. Roughly 80 if we're trying to be somewhat precise. Few offer the combination of exposure to integrated oil stocks, independent producers and mid-cap M&A targets as XOP does. Plus, XOP is valid way of getting exposure to just about every shale play in the U.S. and the ETF's volatility is great for short-term traders. For those that handle the volatility, XOP could see the $70 area in a favorable market next year. First Trust NASDAQ ABA Community Bank ETF (Nasdaq: QABA): QABA isn't the newest ETF on our list, but it might be the most obscure. It only has $12.6 million in AUM and average daily trade of less than 2,600 shares. On the bright side, QABA has outperformed the ETFs tracking major bank stocks this year and most of its holdings have not been dividend offenders. If you're going to dance with devil, er financial sector ETFs, QABA merits consideration. Guggenheim Solar ETF (NYSE: TAN): We debated including an ETF that trades for less than $5 on this list, but after being one of the worst-performing ETFs in 2011, things have to get better for TAN next year, right? Not necessarily. If the things don't get sunny fast for solar stocks, TAN's race to $0 will only be prevented by a reverse split, an event that probably should have happened already."
2011-12-09,Van Eck Announces Index Changes For Market Vectors ETFs,"Van Eck, the sixth-largest U.S. ETF issuer, announced changes to the indexes used for several of its popular Market Vectors ETFs. The Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap Index used for the Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: BRF) will add three companies and remove two. The ETF is currently home to 73 constituents and has almost $604 million in assets under management. The index used for the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) will remove four components but add seven. There are currently 77 holdings in that ETF, which has $2.3 billion in assets under management. The index for the Market Vectors Rare Earths/Strategic Metals ETF (NYSE: REMX) will make one addition and no deletions while the index used for the Market Vectors Colombia ETF (NYSE: COLX) will make one deletion and no additions. Two components will be removed from the index tracking the Market Vectors Egypt ETF (NYSE: EGPT) while the index for the Market Vectors India Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: SCIF) will add seven components and delete 11. The indexes for the Market Vectors Indonesia ETF (NYSE: IDX) and the Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX) will not see changes. The Market Vectors LatAm Small-Cap Index ETF's (NYSE: LATM) will add 11 components and remove five. The index for the Market Vectors Vietnam ETF (NYSE: VNM) will remove one member."

2011-12-14,Safe Haven No More: ETFs For Gold's Decline,"Paradise has been lost. At least for the gold bugs. We're not saying the decade-long bull run in gold is over, but there are ominous signs to that affect. Take the case of the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) for example. The world's second-largest ETF by assets is below its 200-day moving average on its weekly chart for the first time since early 2009. The point and figure chart for the ETF indicates a decline to $136 is possible and, not surprisingly, the outlook is no better for GLD rivals such as the iShares Comex Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Maybe the yellow metal is taking a rest. Maybe it's about to reverse trend and enter a legitimate bear market. Time will tell and we'll tell you about some of the ETFs you need to know about for an extended gold slide. Potential Winners Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST): Apparently, we were ahead of the game by touting this ETF back in September. Back then, DUST was double leveraged, but it recently added some juice and moved to the triple leveraged neighborhood. Put it this way, if gold mining stocks and ETFs struggled to rise with gold going higher, they're not going to go up with gold going down. DUST has a lot of upside in it, perhaps even 10% over the next few days. PowerShares Dollar Bullish (NYSE: UUP): We're having a hard time believing it, too. Two endorsements for UUP in the same day. Well, if gold isn't a safe have right now, then what is? Obviously the U.S. dollar. ProShares UltraShort Silver (NYSE: ZSL): The experts say gold drags silver higher. Logically, that means it would drag the white metal lower. The bad news is the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) and the ETFS Physical Silver Shares (NYSE: SIVR) need no downside assistance as both are down more than 23% in the past three months. That means it's time to dial up ZSL, which can ring up gains of 5% or more in a single day. WisdomTree Managed Futures ETF (NYSE: WDTI): As we've been telling you lately, the WisdomTree Managed Futures ETF has short positions in gold and silver futures. Obviously, that makes this unheralded ETF worth a look here. Potential Losers Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ): Reference the part on DUST for information, but consider this as well: If GDXJ violates support at $24, its probably going to $20 for the first time since early 2010. By the way, this probably isn't the environment for small-caps of any stripe. CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust (NYSE: FXA): The Aussie dollar is a commodity currency and the commodity it has shown a historical correlation with is gold. Typically, gold moves first and the Aussie dollar responds. That could mean more declines for FXA are on the way, especially if support at $98 is violted. iShares MSCI South Africa Index Fund (NYSE: EZA): EZA did not make our list of emerging markets ETFs to watch next year. Now we might have a really good reason for that. South Africa is a major gold miner and EZA has been acting like a mining ETF, slumping as gold has gone up. In fact, EZA is down almost 21% year-to-date even as the SPDR Gold Shares is up more than 15%. That's not a good sign. Action Items: Traders that believe gold is going to continue falling should consider the following trades: Long DUST, long the PowerShares DB Gold Double Short ETN (NYSE: DZZ), long UUP. Traders that are willing to bet on a rebound for gold should consider the following trades: Long IAU, Short ZSL, long the ETFS Physical PM Basket Shares (NYSE: GLTR).

2012-01-05,5 Commodities ETFs That Could Disappoint In 2012,"Rising oil prices. Debased currencies. Central banks eager to print more money. If the past couple of years have taught investors anything it is that having some commodities exposure within a portfolio isn't such a bad thing. The other side of that coin is that selectivity is a must when picking commodities ETFs and ETNs. Simply put, not all commodities are sure bets from the long side. In fact, some commodities ETFs and ETNs are epic disappointments for any number of reasons. Whether it's the continuous rolling of futures contracts or just downright slack price action in the underlying commodity itself, some commodities exchange-traded products look poised to be better short trades than anything else in 2012. Here are five to consider avoiding. iPath DJ-UBS Livestock TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: COW) Holy cow, did you know that feeder cattle futures provided the best returns of all commodities when adjusted for volatility in the second half of last year? That factoid comes courtesy of Bloomberg, which notes feeder cattle even outperformed gold in the back half of 2011. COW tracks lean hogs and live cattle prices, so it's not a play on a feeder cattle. What COW is is a disappointment. The ETN underperformed the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) in the past six months and if the global economy slows, live cattle prices will fall, pressuring COW along the way. iPath DJ-UBS Coffee TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: JO) Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer, is expected to turnout robust coffee supplies this year and unless the weather there suddenly changes for the worse, it's clear the iPath DJ-UBS Coffee TR Sub-Index ETN could be caught on the wrong side of the supply/demand dynamic. The reality is global coffee demand is soaring and Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) has raised prices in select markets. Those factors would appear to work in JO's favor, but the ETN continues to tumble. It's a short below $52. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) In this case, we should emphasize GDXJ has the POTENTIAL to disappoint this year. That would mean a sequel to what investors had to contend with in 2011 when ETFs like GLD rose, but funds like GDXJ lagged in a big way. That said, if you're a believer in the January Effect, GDXJ might be a pleasant surprise in 2012. Since December 29, the ETF has surged almost 16% after finding support at $22. iPath DJ-UBS Cocoa TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: NIB) When an investor buys the iPath DJ-UBS Cocoa TR Sub-Index ETN, he or she is put in an interesting position. Beyond hoping for bad weather that could crimp cocoa supplies, cheering for political instability in major cocoa-producing nations is part of the deal as well. Well, that could easily happen since Ivory Coast and Ghana are the world's two largest cocoa producers, but it's not happening right now. In fact, cocoa shipments from those two countries are rising. Chocolate is sweet. NIB's performance is not. The ETN has been crushed in the past year. Teucrium WTI Crude Oil Fund (NYSE: CRUD) Let's clear up the inclusion of CRUD on this list. We are not extolling a bearish view on oil. In fact, CRUD is a useful fund for traders looking for a contango-fighting oil play. However, the potential disappointment comes in the form of CRUD's expense ratio of 1.58%. That's high, though not all that terrible by the standards of oil futures ETFs and ETNs. Then again, it's fees like that make equities-based ETFs more economical plays on rising oil prices. Bottom line: CRUD's expense ratio will eat away at your returns."
2012-01-11,Why Ron Paul's Proposed Military Cuts Could Ruin the Economy,"Perhaps the most intriguing development in the Republican US presidential nomination race has been the ascendancy of Ron Paul. Although it seems unlikely that he can win the nomination, he’s managed to carve out a dedicated support base of voters. The key to his appeal has been his back to basics approach. He wants to drastically cut taxes, balance the budget, and severely limit the powers of the government. Only through a free market, Paul believes, can America return to prosperity. One way he would achieve his goal of a balanced budget is by cutting government spending on the military. War is never economically beneficial except for those in position to profit from war expenditures, Paul said in the US House of Representatives back in 2004. Taken at face value, Paul’s arguments against military spending can be persuasive. Yet, it ignores certain, important realities. The US federal, state, and local governments now spend about $6 trillion - or 40% of the nation's GDP - annually. This spending is directly responsible for 20% of the production cited in the official US GDP number, which is currently at about $15 trillion according to the International Monetary Fund. The federal government spent roughly $1 trillion of its budget on national defense in 2011. That estimate includes the budget of the Department of Defense ($700 billion) and Department of Homeland Security, “international assistance” costs, interest payments on debts from past wars, and spending by other agencies like the Department of Energy or CIA on programs that can be considered part of the country’s national defense strategy. So, let’s say that Paul is elected president and manages to cut the national defense budget in half. Now, the US is only spending $500 billion. At first glance, that seems like a modest cut, especially considering Paul’s fierce anti-spending stance. He'd want to cut more than that. Still, the effects on the US economy would be immediate and painful. Assuming that the US GDP is still $15 trillion, such cuts would reduce the national GDP to about $14.7 trillion, a 2% loss. In 2010, the US GDP only grew by 3.03%, and much of that growth can be directly attributed government spending. In the two years before that, US GDP growth was negative. A 2% loss in GDP from spending cuts – which would be impossible to replace right away - would make posting positive quarterly GDP numbers that much more difficult. For example, half of GDP growth in 2Q 2010 was from government spending. Weak or negative GDP numbers would wreak havoc on the markets and could easily plunge the US into full-fledged recession. That would be bad news for most investors. The US economy has been slow to recover since 2008, and can’t afford many major setbacks. Maybe the only stocks that would truly benefit from such news would be gold and, to a lesser extent, silver stocks. Gold and silver have long been viewed as safe havens in times of crises. It should come as no surprise that 64% of Paul’s investment portfolio is in gold and silver mining stocks. If Paul was elected president, or if his budget ideas were ever adopted in full, it might be wise to join him and invest in Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) or Global X Silver Miners (NYSE: SIL). Of course, the traditional counter-argument to claims that government spending is necessary is that any loss in spending would be offset by the savings that could be passed onto Americans through tax cuts. It’s a position often championed by Paul. However, Americans are already paying the lowest share of their income in taxes since 1958. When they do have more spending money, they tend to quickly pass it on to the developing countries that produce the goods Americans covet most. Apple’s (NASDAQ: APPL) iPhone alone added about $2 billion to the US trade deficit in 2009. Furthermore, the gains in GDP from retail spending are often not as pronounced as the headlines would have the public believe. In fact, only about 44% of consumer spending is in retail. Though the official corporate tax rate seems high at 35% for corporations making over $18,333,333 a year, thanks to loopholes the federal government is actually collecting less in taxes as a percentage of GDP from major corporations than it used to. Would General Electric (NYSE: GE) - which paid zero US taxes in 2010 – invest more in the US if corporate tax rates were lowered? Or what about Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), which managed to pay nothing in US income taxes in 2009? The answer to both is probably not. Instead, major corporations would likely continue to invest abroad, where developing markets presently offer more attractive growth potential. Small businesses are often viewed as the main employers in the US, but recent tax breaks for small businesses have also done little to stimulate US hiring. Many small business owners maintained that they would only hire more if the economy recovered. Underemployment in the US remains rampant. If the US economy is going to recover to pre-2008 levels, government investment will have to be one of the main drivers. In an economy where corporations are heavily investing in foreign countries and one-fifth of the GDP depends on government spending, it’s too late for Paul to preach small government. Cutting the national defense budget at time like this would be shortsighted, and not just because of its direct effect on the GDP. CNN Money called weapons the hottest export in the US in early 2011, and Obama has identified weapon sales as one of the keys to increasing US exports over the next half-decade. Without the government’s national defense spending, the arms industry would quickly whither. Defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT), Boeing (NYSE: BA), Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC), and General Dynamics (NYSE: GD) would be hit hard. Those companies are expecting some downturns in the arms market even without Paul’s proposed cuts. Eventually, spending cuts have to happen. Standard & Poor’s downgrading of the US credit rating last summer proves that major federal budget deficits can’t go on forever. That being said, kneejerk reactions like Paul’s proposal to cut $1 trillion in spending and eliminate five cabinet departments in one year would be disastrous for the economy. Government spending will need to be reined in gradually over time. Otherwise, the US economy will quickly be in for a world of hurt."

2012-02-28,"Breakout: ETFs on the Verge of Big Things (HAO, FCG, KBE)","With stocks continuing to grind higher, latecomers to the party might be feeling as if they missed out on some good moves. They have, but hey, no one is perfect and the good news is there's a fair amount of non-leveraged ETFs that are worth a look right now. By worth a look, we mean those funds that are still a considerable distance away from their 52-week highs and that are on the verge of significant technical breakouts. There's more good news: The five ETFs we've selected that meet the aforementioned criteria would make for a diverse portfolio on their own as various sectors and countries are found in our group. Guggenheim China Small Cap ETF (NYSE: HAO) The Guggenheim China Small Cap ETF has surged almost 50% off its October bottom and that statistic might keeping new capital on the sidelines regarding this fund. That's understandable, but remember: Chinese ETFs have been strong this year, emerging markets in general have impressed and small-cap funds have been stout as well. HAO has that combination. It has the potential for significant upside if it can crack $24 on strong volume. Asking for the 52-week high of just over $30 in the near-term might be a little greedy, but a move to the high $20s in the next couple of months isn't out of the realm of possibility. First Trust ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index Fund (NYSE: FCG) FCG is useful for a surprising amount of sub-plots in the energy space, not the least of which is increased mergers and acquisitions activity and the move by many companies away from natural gas production to increased oil output. So on those two points alone, FCG has merit. The ETF has been a solid, but not yet jaw-dropping performer in 2012 and that's actually appealing. Should FCG clear $20, an area that proved to be serious resistance three times last year, seeing this ETF go to $22-$23 is plausible. SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE: KBE) Resurgent bank stocks have been a nice bonus for wary investors in 2012 and for those that just couldn't decide which one to settle on, ETFs have served their purpose. With KBE up almost 13% year-to-date and almost 33% since October, it would be wise to wait for the ETF to clear what is proving to be some stiff resistance around $22.60. KBE has been able to peak through a couple of times recently, but can't stick above an uptrend line. That's what needs to happen for a legitimate breakout to be confirmed here. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) Now this is one that run hard and fast should it clear its next major technical hurdle. After struggling to keep pace with bullion for almost all of 2011, mining ETFs have gotten their acts together in 2012. GDXJ recently emerged from a reverse head and shoulders formation and is now dealing with some resistance just pennies above current levels. That's not the only hurdle. The ETF also needs to reclaim its 200-day line just below $31 and $31 looks like horizontal resistance. In other words, if GDXJ can accomplish all of those feats, it would be an overtly bullish sign. Global X FTSE ASEAN 40 ETF (NYSE: ASEA) Another ETF that has a solid fundamental resume ASEA has been having a solid, but unspectacular 2012 by the standards of emerging markets ETFs. A strong volume move above $16.40 could lead to upside of 10% from there."
2012-02-28,Small Cap Gold Stocks Successfully Retest 2010 Breakout,"By Jordan Roy-Byrne, The Daily Gold When one speaks of gold stocks they should be more specific as the sector is diverse. The term Gold stocks usually refers to the large unhedged producers. Indices such as the HUI or GDX track these stocks and are a proxy for the gold stock universe. However, most companies in the sector are much smaller. We hear the term “juniors” so often and that is what makes it inconsistent. Juniors are typically micro-cap exploration companies. Yet, GDXJ the junior ETF is comprised of companies with market caps in the $500 Million to $1 Billion range. There is nothing junior about that. We notice there is a gap in terms of terminology. If Juniors are sub- $100 Million, and large caps are over $1 Billion, then what do you call those that fit the gap? We prefer to use the term “established juniors” or small cap. After all, small caps by definition are in market cap between $100 Million and $1 Billion. These terms are most appropriate for those in the middle of said range rather than the bottom or top. We prefer the established juniors as being established (which is open to interpretation) they have less risk than the true juniors and if successful can grow to $1 Billion or more in capitalization. In our opinion, small caps are the area to focus on as they have a much greater likelihood of growth and leverage to Gold than the large producers. Historically, the large producers do not outperform Gold on a consistent basis. The law of numbers combined with the difficulty of the mining business explains why. Our junior/small cap index consists of 20 stocks equally weighted with a median market cap of about 600 Million. In the second half of 2010 the market broke to new highs for the first time since 2007. With every breakout comes a retest. Heading into 2011 we predicted the retest would last into the summer. The retest lasted the entire year but appears to be successful. Our bet is that the small caps will work their way back to the high before the end of the summer. It will take the time to overcome resistance but the trend will remain higher. If and when the market makes a new all-time high it will be very bullish for several reasons. It would be the first sustained breakout to a new all-time high since 2005-2006. It would come at a time when the bull market is starting to transition out of the wall of worry phase. Finally, it would generate significant momentum when overhead resistance is basically nil. This is possible due to a combination of Gold rising and present low valuations improving. In the next chart we graph our index and the ratio of our index to Gold. Gold companies are generating record profits and the price of Gold is near its all-time high yet leveraged small caps are trading near a low relative to Gold. That, in our view is a function of market sentiment and evidence of the wall of worry stage. If the ratio would rise back to its 2007 and 2010 highs at 0.065 and Gold would reach $2000, our small cap index would just about double. That is right, a potential 100% gain. The bottom line is small cap gold stocks have completed a textbook breakout and retest. As we said, the market will likely have a hard slog for the next several months as it encounters supply from the 2011 correction. If and when the market nears its old high it will have built up the necessary strength and momentum to embark on an explosive breakout. Thus, now is the time to be doing your due diligence to find and research those candidates to lead the market in a potential rip roaring move into 2013.

2012-03-06,"Brokedown Palace: These ETFs are in Technical Trouble (BRF, GDXJ, XLK)","With the S&P 500 suffering through its worst day since December, today is probably an ideal time for traders to peruse their portfolios for those positions that are showing signs of more downside yet to come. Especially when considering this rocky start to March is not a good sign because March historically starts well and ends poorly. Not to rain on anyone's parade, but if Monday and Tuesday are any indication, this could be a nasty month. If there's any good news it's that there's still time to take profits in some ETFs that are now showing signs of breaking down. Either take profits or keep losses small, wait for the pullback to complete, reassess and buy back some old positions or initiate new ones. Rinse, wash, repeat. With that, here are five ETFs to get you started that look like their in obvious technical danger. Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: BRF) Things had been going along quite nicely for the Market Vectors Brazil Small-Cap ETF in 2012, but the situation has changed quickly in recent days. Monday brought the double-whammy of disappointing Brazilian inflation data and lower-than-expected Chinese GDP growth estimates. Those are fundamental reasons to avoid BRF in the near-term. On the charts, BRF was rebuffed at $47, its RSI and stochastics have viciously corrected in just a couple of days and the ETF could fall to the low $40s before finding support. That might be a good point to load up on BRF, which still has a compelling story to it. Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) The Technology Select Sector SPDR isn't in near the technical danger that BRF is in, but that's also an apples-to-oranges comparison. Look, we all know that as long as Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) continues its run to $600 and beyond, ETFs like XLK are fine places to be. Problem is even Apple cannot accomplish that in straight line fashion and the stock is showing some near-term weakness. That means XLK and its 17.7% allocation to Apple are going to show weakness. XLK's RSI and stochastics have just started to wilt and the 20-day moving average could be taken out today. Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) The Energy Select Sector SPDR is another example of fundamental issues begetting technical doldrums. Oil prices are high and look destined to remain that way for the foreseeable future. Problem for XLE is that almost a third of the ETF's weight is allocated to Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and those stocks aren't as sensitive to oil's short-term upside movements as many investors would like to believe. Now XLE needs to hold its 50-day line and horizontal support around $72 or risk a moderate pullback to its 200-day line just below $70. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) To be honest, GDXJ has probably already broken down and it has been flashing signs that it would for a couple of weeks now. Even in favorable environment in February, the ETF just couldn't crack the $30-$31 area. Today, it's down 4.4% on strong volume. Trading around $25.50, GDXJ could easily fall to $22 if this broader market pullback deepens. ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT) The near-term outlook for the ETFS Physical Platinum Shares changed at heart-stopping speed. This ETF still looked like it was in pretty good shape last week, but macro concerns have a way of plaguing metals that have an industrial component to them. PPLT struggled with some resistance around $170, faltered, gave up support at $165 and looks like it has downside to $155. Chart indicators show there is at least an average chance PPLT is in for more near-term weakness."
2012-03-13,"HUI, XAU No Longer Adequately Represent the Mining Stock Universe","By Jordan Roy-Byrne These indices are failing to represent precious metals equities as a whole. They're polluted by the dramatic underperformance of certain companies, which is not a reflection of gold stock fundamentals. The underperformance of gold stocks was a hot topic at PDAC and continues to dominate discussion in industry circles. As to why the sector is underperforming, we hear numerous reasons. The conspiracy crowd will claim manipulation or hedge fund shorting. More well-reasoned thoughts include the struggle of large miners to adequately replace reserves and grow production and the continued issuance of shares. At my firm we believe one key reason is that the bull market is in the wall-of-worry phase, and in this phase valuations compress as investors are nervous about, among other things, another major correction. The HUI is trading at 15x trailing earnings and only 13x 2012 earnings. If the market returned to the historical average valuation of 28x earnings, then share prices would double (and that assumes present earnings). Yet, does the HUI or XAU even adequately represent the mining stock universe anymore? The HUI is the go-to index for the sector but it is failing to represent precious metals equities as a whole. The HUI is currently trading at the same level as in November 2009. That means it has made no net progress in 27 months! In the same time period, gold is up 42%. The junior ETF (GDXJ) is up only marginally. The (CDNX) is up only 15%. I don't know about you but I can think of numerous companies that have performed fantastically in the same period. One problem is that these indices are being polluted by the dramatic underperformance of certain companies, which is not a reflection of gold stock fundamentals. Newmont Mining (NEM), which is a percentage of numerous indices, is at the same price as it was in 1996. Kinross Gold (KGC), Agnico-Eagle (AEM) and IAMGOLD (IAG) have fallen 40% or more in just the past six months. This performance has little to due with negative sector fundamentals, yet it has a negative effect on the index and can greatly distort a correct analysis of the gold stocks. Being sick and tired of the HUI, XAU, and gold miners ETF (GDX), and basically any of these indices, we decided to create our own. This equal-weighted index includes 10 of the largest, best-performing gold companies. It is up about 40% in that 27-month period. The index closed Friday at 80 and we see a confluence of support at 68, which is also the 38% retracement from the 2008 low to 2011 high. We've relied on our own proprietary silver stock index for a while. (SIL), the silver stock ETF, is not too bad but it is exposed to Hecla (HL), Pan American (PAAS), Silver Standard (SSRI), and Couer D'Alene (CDE). These are four companies that have dramatically underperformed silver in the past four years. Our index (shown below) contains 10 silver producers that are focused on growth. The underperformance of the mining stocks occurred in the 1970s and is occurring again. As we've argued countless times, there is no historical record of the large mining stocks outperforming. Mining is an extremely difficult business and even more so the larger the firm. It is the law of numbers. It is difficult to grow from a large starting point. Smartly, large gold miners are starting to increase dividends. They aren't attracting growth investors so they decided to seek out value investors. This is a smart move. Nevertheless, as you can see from our indices, there are many companies that are actually outperforming. The market of precious metals equities is not limited to the HUI or XAU. There are hundreds and hundreds of other companies out there. Moreover, it is very important to note that the large miners did not go parabolic in the late 1970s. The Barron's Gold Mining Index performed well but actually performed better in the 1960s. The reason is because the last third of a bull market sees increasing speculation. It was the juniors and small cap miners that received the speculative interest. At some point the market will diverge and the smaller miners will outperform the large caps. This is why we are focused on the smaller companies, which show value and excellent growth potential.

2012-03-19,Precious Metals Are Decoupling From the Stock Market,"By Jordan Roy-Byrne Unless you feel the bull market in precious metals is over, you should use this opportunity to be a contrarian. Normally, decoupling from the stock market is a good thing. In recent turbulent times, many have wondered if emerging markets would decouple or if gold stocks would decouple. It's surprising to see gold stocks decouple from a strong stock market. Many wondered if the sector would decouple from a weak market. Yet, the decoupling now could be positive long-term provided the decoupling continues when the stock market peaks just below the 2007-2008 highs. Below we plot the S&P 500 and the Gold Bugs Index (^HUI). At the bottom we show the 100-day correlation between the two markets. Note that the correlation has been trending down since the end of 2010. The broad stock market (S&P 500) appears to be headed for a test of major resistance at 1500 while the large cap gold stocks just closed at a 52-week low. Although large-cap gold stocks have closed at a new low, the rest of the sector has not followed suit. The chart below shows the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ), the CDNX (Canadian venture exchange), and Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL). While the HUI has closed at a new low, the other markets remain well above their December lows. The CDNX and SIL are showing a strong divergence since October. Should most of the precious metals sector hold its December lows, then it will be very encouraging for the sector even with the large caps breaking to new lows. One can recall 2007-2008 when the speculative side of the sector fell to new lows well ahead of the metals and the large-cap gold stocks. One should also keep the 1970s in mind. Large-cap miners experienced significant gains at the start of the bull market but not at the end. Sure, the large caps performed well from 1974-1980, but it was the speculative side of the sector that captured the vast majority of the gains. Presently, the precious metals sector has underperformed badly as the stock market has continued to move higher. We know that it is highly unlikely the S&P 500 is going to make new highs. In fact, in two of the previous three secular bear markets, the market in the second half of the bear rallied to within 5% of the all-time high before falling back into a mild four- to five-year bear market. This happened in 1909 and 1976. Profit margins, the most mean reverting statistic in finance, are already at record highs. Higher interest rates and higher inflation will cut into profit margins. Everyone loves stocks now, and the masses can forget about gold stocks. This is a perfect contrarian opportunity for precious metals investors. The S&P 500 is nearing resistance and the precious metals sector is testing its December low. A successful retest of the low in many markets (juniors, metals, silver stocks) should be a signal that the market has confirmed its bottom. Unless you feel the bull market in precious metals is over, then you should use this opportunity to be a contrarian. We may not get another buying opportunity like this for a few years.

2012-03-22,"Avoid These ETFs For Now (FXI, TVIX, GDXJ)","The reality is we live in an instant gratification world and the financial markets are no exception. If anything, the markets are perpetrators of the please me now outlook so many of us have. No big deal because there is clearly something to be said in favor of short-term trading. On the other hand, trading for the sake of trading is not a sound risk management philosophy and sometimes it pays to know what to avoid as it is knowing what to embrace. That's what we're looking at here: A few ETFs that have particularly bleak prospects over the next several weeks that have the near-term avoid label. VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (NYSE: TVIX) The level of controversy surrounding volatility ETNs is just too much to make them worth embracing. Like leveraged ETFs such as the Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: FAS), volatility ETNs like TVIX are best left to the pros. When an ETN drops more than 12% in a single day in part because its net asset value got a little rich, it's probably best to leave this thing alone. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) This is one a lot of traders clearly have on their personal avoid/sell short lists and that much is highlighted by what has become a grizzly performance over the past month. The knock on ETFs such as the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF and its large-cap cousin, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has been that they don't do a good job of tracking gold prices on the upside. In twist of the dagger, these ETFs do respond to gold futures selling off. Let's say this: GDXJ was near $29 when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke quashed hopes for QE3 in February. The ETF is at $24 today and looks poised to test its 52-week low. Don't be fooled by what looks like an inviting yield. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) The problem with the Materials Select Sector SPDR at the moment is two-fold. First, the ETF's chart shows technical vulnerability. Second, this an ETF that should be responding to positive U.S. economic data more than it is. XLB is being hamstrung by weakness in Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), two of its top-10 holdings. Until those two names, Freeport in particular, get their acts together, XLB is in for near-term weakness. iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) There are plenty of reasons to be avoiding the China pain train right now and plenty of ETFs where a short or sidelines approach is warranted. Actually, there are nearly 230 ETFs offering China exposure, but FXI, the largest China fund makes the list today. Yes, Chinese equities have cheaper valuations right now than broader emerging markets universe. The broader Chinese market is also down over the past year and the macro environment is not supportive of more upside in the here and now. We're not forecasting a new bear market for Chinese stocks, but we will say better prices will be available for FXI in the coming weeks."
2012-03-23,"A Look Ahead: Next Week's ETFs to Watch (GAZ, OIH, GDXJ)","One thing is for certain: The just finished trading week did not lack for excitement. Whether it was China roiling global markets with more economic data or a suspect ETN setting off a wave controversy this was not a boring week by any stretch of the imagination. With some earnings reports worth watching starting to creep up on us and the lingering risk of global macroeconomic issues ruining the market's upward momentum, plenty of ETFs will be worth a trade or two next week. Here are few that made our cut. iPath DJ-UBS Natural Gas TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: GAZ) In the wake of the VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (NYSE: TVIX) debacle, a lot eyes turned to the iPath DJ-UBS Natural Gas TR Sub-Index ETN as a potential candidate for some ETN/net asset value carnage. As we noted this morning, GAZ entered Friday trading at a massive premium to its indicative value. The ETN was hammered today, losing almost 7% on above average volume, but its Friday closing price is still almost double Thursday's indicative value. More downside? Maybe. Market Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSE: OIH) This isn't necessarily a bullish endorsement of the Market Vectors Oil Services ETF, but the ETF finished a lousy week with a strong performance, gaining 1.6% on decent tape today. OIH seems to have found support at $41 and that could result in a nice technical setup for traders next week. Of course, higher oil prices would be helpful. iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) Chinese stocks and their corresponding ETFs listed here in the U.S. have become a real battleground thanks to China's spate of bad economic news. Seriously, it feels like not a week goes buy when China doesn't spook the global marketplace with another glum economic data point. The reality is the Chinese economy, the world's second-largest, is probably in for a hard landing and that means FXI, the largest China-specific ETF, will be in for a hard landing as well. iShares MSCI Thailand Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: THD) While China ETFs look unappealing to say the least right now, the same should not be said of all ETFs tracking emerging Asian economies. THD is easily one of the stalwarts of this group, if not the outright stud of the Asia ETF group. THD is trading within 1% of a new high, has an exceptional chart, clear momentum and volume has been noticeably higher in the fund in recent days. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) This is a prime example of don't be fooled. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF had a nice day on Friday. The ETF has a nice yield of almost 4.2%. Don't be fooled by either of those seemingly bullish points. GDXJ's chart is weak as is the chart for gold futures and gold-backed ETFs. The path of least resistance is clearly lower for GDXJ. In fact, the ETF could retest its 52-week low in the near-term."

2012-04-05,ETF Sleuth: Anything Behind Palladium ETF's Volume Increase?,"On any given trading day, there are myriad examples of select stocks and ETFs showing unusual trading volume, but when volume spikes on the day before a three-day weekend, above average turnover is truly noteworthy. That might be the case with the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) on Thursday. The ETFS Physical Palladium Shares, the lone U.S.-listed ETF backed by physical palladium, surged $1.18, or 1.89%, to $63.75 on volume of over 200,400 shares compared with average daily turnover of 115,400 shares. Even with the Thursday pop, PALL is still slightly lower on the year and the ETF has dropped over 8% in the past month after failing to crack resistance around $70, so it can be argued that Thursday's pre-holiday good cheer in PALL is curious. Perhaps PALL got a charge from some bullish auto sales reported earlier this week. On a related note, the Global X Auto ETF (NYSE: VROM) jumped almost 1.6% today, but volume in that fund was just 40% of the daily average. PALL's Thursday rise could also be a delayed reaction to a Bloomberg on March 29. Palladium could average $850 an ounce in the fourth quarter of this year, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. From current levels, that would be a gain of over 30% far outpacing the gains expected for gold, silver and platinum. Citing Barclays, Bloomberg goes on to note palladium prices are poised to rise because carmakers are still using the most metal ever, with the prospect of shortages because of less supply from state reserves in Russia. Russia is the world's largest palladium producer and South Africa is the second-largest. Coincidentally, the iShares MSCI South Africa Index Fund (NYSE: EZA) gained almost 1% on volume that was better than double the daily average. On the other side of the increase volume coin on Thursday, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) slid another 1.6% and touched a new 52-week low on turnover that was about 25% higher than usual. The brutal reality as it pertains to GDXJ, which is down almost 16% in the past month, is that the volume spike isn't all that extraordinary. It may simply be a case of wary investors giving up on gold miners as ETF Trends noted."
2012-04-06,"A Look Ahead: Next Week's ETFs to Watch (EWG, GDXJ, GLD)","It took just four days for the S&P 500 to notch its worst trading week of 2012 and things aren't looking good for a strong Monday open. The epic disappointment that was the March jobs report send S&P 500 futures down 1.1% during Friday's shortened 45-minute trading session. S&P 500 futures closed just under 1,375 and there is now ample talk the index is headed back to 1,350. Those are not the kinds of thoughts conducive to enjoying a long weekend. Neither is knowing first-quarter earnings season is about to kick off and S&P 500 earnings sans Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) won't show much, if any, growth. With that, here are some ETFs to keep an eye on next week. SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) After closing around $1,630 an ounce on Thursday, gold futures are still in a sensitive area, technically speaking. If psychological support at $1,600 an ounce doesn't hold, that mean a decline to $1,580 or even $1,550 is in the cards. GLD's already vulnerable chart what be doomed by that decline. The adventurous among us might want to give palladium a look. Guggenheim China Small Cap ETF (NYSE: HAO) It was just one day, but the Guggenheim China Small Cap ETF did pop 2.5% on light volume on Thursday. More importantly, the ETF seems to be finding support at $22. That makes things pretty simple in both directions. Above $22, HAO is a long. Below there, it's a short. iShares MSCI Germany Index Fund (NYSE: EWG) Another case of a chart sending out some clear signals, the iShares MSCI Germany Index Fund has to contend with PIIGS headline risk once again. The PIIGS are a leech on the strength of the German economy and if Spanish and Italian bond yields continue rising next week, EWG could easily fall 3% to give up its 200-day line. There's your short signal. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) Can you say capitulation? GDXJ apparently can. If GDXJ does not find support at $22, the next stopping point could easily be the $18-$19 area. There are two reasons to avoid GDXJ right now. First, the ETF didn't offer much upside when gold prices were rising, so what can one expect when gold futures fall? Second, GDXJ has been getting punished on strong volume. That's a tell and it's not good."

2012-04-13,"Grab Some Momo With These ETFs (KWT, THD, GDXJ)","Finding so-called momentum stocks, either bullish or bearish plays, isn't that hard. Nor is finding ETFs that are chock full of individual momentum plays. Finding an ETF that's a momentum play in its own right? Well, that's a different story altogether and the task is made a bit harder when stripping leveraged funds. By design, the likes of the Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: FAS) and the Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TZA) are momentum plays. They always have been and probably always will be. Simply put, finding a plain vanilla long ETF that can qualify as a momentum play isn't as taxing as it might appear. Plenty of unleveraged ETFs have the momentum designation, for better or worse. Here are some that are screaming momentum plays at the moment and have been for a while. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) Short-term bearish traders have got to love the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF because the daily percentage moves this ETF makes are almost on par with that of a leveraged fund. In the past year, GDXJ has traded in a range of just over $22 to just over $40 with the low end being seen earlier this week. GDXJ is no exception to the miners not tracking gold prices conundrum and the chart is marked by a series of lower highs and lower lows. Troubling fundamentals and bad technicals make for a great bearish momentum play. Active traders should note that GDXJ has offered up some quick upside when bouncing off $22. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP) No single stock accounts for more than 1.66% of the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF's weight, so one or two names do not set the course for this highly volatile ETF. That should not be a reason to avoid XOP as a momentum play, though. As is the case with GDXJ, XOP can make intraday percentage moves that would make one think he's trading a leveraged ETF. Highlighting its penchant for rapid gains (and losses), XOP surged over 30% from late December through March. The ETF has proceeded to tumble almost 9% in the past month. Call it momentum, call it volatility. Whatever label is applied, XOP moves hard and fast and the ETF frequently has an extremely high short interest, sometimes in excess of 100% of its float and that just adds to the volatility and big moves. iShares MSCI Thailand Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: THD) Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) or Priceline (Nasdaq: PCLN) THD is not, but the lone Thailand ETF does have momentum behind it right now. Buoyed by sound fundamentals THD is a buy as long as support at $70 holds. Looking at THD's three-year chart, this ETF does bare some resemblance to high-flying momentum stocks in that the returns are now deep into the triple-digits (assuming one bought the fund in early 2009) and that every significant dip has been a legitimate buying opportunity. Market Vectors Solar ETF (NYSE: KWT) When it comes to solar ETFs, there are two: The Market Vectors Solar ETF (NYSE: KWT) and the Guggenheim Solar ETF (NYSE: TAN). TAN and KWT share something in common. They're excellent bearish momentum plays as both have plunged 70% in the past year. Short-sellers take heart because there is likely more downside to come for both funds. Yield hunters should not be fooled by the juicy yields here. TAN and KWT are yield traps and with KWT trading for less than $4, it might be only a matter of time before it follows TAN down Reverse Split Boulevard.

2012-05-08,"Bust A Move: Inverse ETFs Breaking Out (FAZ, BZQ, SCC)","ETF critics either don't know, overlook or intentionally ignore a key advantage of these products: They alleviate the burden of stock-picking for investors looking to establish long positions. Fortunately, inverse ETFs present traders and investors with the same advantage on the downside. Inverse country and sector ETFs allow traders to exploit downside themes without the need for identifying the single best bearish play at the stock level. To be sure, inverse and leveraged ETFs require due diligence and the realization these are short-term trading vehicles. With that important disclaimer out of the way, recent weakness in U.S. equities has damaged the charts of plenty of marquee stocks along with a large number of traditional long country and sector funds. Said differently, some of the best looking charts in the ETF universe at the moment are found with inverse funds. Consider the following: ProShares UltraShort Brazil (NYSE: BZQ) Indeed, we just highlighted BZQ a few days ago, but the chart keeps on improving for this double-leveraged inverse play. That is to say the charts for Brazil funds such as the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ) keep getting worse, not better. On Monday, Benzinga noted that EWZ was down about 17% from its 2012 peak and that a 20% decline from that top puts the ETF in bear territory. Well, EWZ is down another 2% today we're getting closer to bear market territory. While EWZ is breaking down, BZQ is trying to breakout. Late comeers should watch for a move above $18, which could foretell a move to $20. Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) Can you remember the last time anyone had anything to say about the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) or the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ)? We can't either. On a seemingly daily basis, GDX and GDXJ make new 52-week lows. Gold miners underperformed gold futures on the upside and now that gold is being treated as a risk asset, the miners are getting slammed on the yellow metal's downside. There very well could be a day when gold's safe haven status is restored and the miners rally. Problem is that day isn't likely to arrive in the next week or even the next month. DUST is simply the best way to play the miners at this juncture. ProShares UltraShort Oil & Gas (NYSE: DUG) Arguing against the long-term bull case for oil stocks is tricky business. In the near-term, however, concerns about Europe's sovereign debt crisis and U.S. and Chinese economic growth are killing oil prices. Of course, that's bad news for funds such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE), the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP) and comparable rivals. As those charts have broken down, DUG's has improved in impressive fashion. Watch for DUG to take out its 200-day moving average and offer more near-term upside. ProShares UltraShort Consumer Services (NYSE: SCC) Give high-end retail and discretionary names some credit. They've held up pretty well. Until today that is. As just three examples, the charts of Coach (NYSE: COH), Michael Kors (NYSE: KORS) and Tiffany (NYSE: TIF) are unappealing right now. SCC is the way to play this trend. For those that need convincing, consider this: SCC's average daily volume is about 8,000 shares. More than 39,000 shares in the ETF have already changed hands today. Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: FAZ) Hopefully, the Direxion Daily Financial Bear 3X Shares will never see the $700 area as it did back in early 2009. It probably won't, but bank stocks were leaders in the first quarter. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) was the best performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in Q1. Welcome to Q2 and sell in May and go away. Bank of America? Hammered. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF)? Vulnerable at best. FAZ just took out its 50-day moving average, perhaps indicating more upside is on the way. For more on inverse ETFs, please click HERE."
2012-05-11,What Happens When ETFs Return to Their Debut Prices?,"It has been said hundreds of times, probably more, that new ETFs should not be treated like hot IPOs for individual stocks. What that means is investors don't need to be involved with a new ETF on its first day of trading. While there's no hard and fast set of guidelines for exactly when the time is right to become involved with a new ETF or ETN, in most cases it's safe to let the first week of trading pass without getting involved. In many instances, it's advisable to let a new ETF age for a month or longer before pulling the trigger on a buy order. That advice highlights a stark difference between new exchanged-traded products and IPOs for individual stocks, but there is one similarity between the two asset classes: The usefulness of the debut price. Applying the theory that once-hot IPOs that return to the price at which the shares debuted often leads to increased selling pressure, we screened for ETFs that, at some point in their respective life spans, have fallen back to their launch prices. What we were hoping to discover is whether or not an ETF's return to its debut price is an efficacious short signal or if that area acts as some kind of mental support. For now, we've only included five ETFs. Our screen excluded inverse and leveraged products, ETFs and ETNs that have undergone reverse splits and includes only funds that are at least a year old. iShares MSCI Italy Index Fund (NYSE: EWI) The lone Italy-specific ETF debuted in March 1996 around $13.50, but it took more than five years for the ETF to trade below its debut and even then the flirtation was brief. EWI repeated the offense again during the global financial crisis in 2008-2009, though plenty of ETFs did the same, so we'll be nice and give EWI a pass. However, we won't give EWI a pass for its most recent break of $13.50, which occurred in March. It might be the last time this ETF breaks its introduction price because at $11.25 and given the Euro Zone's debt woes, it could take a miracle for EWI to see its debut price anytime soon. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) Traders that don't live under a rock know that gold miners have dramatically underperformed gold futures for more than a year now and that situation shows no signs of reversing anytime soon. GDXJ, which will turn three in November, is still home to almost $2 billion in AUM, but another statistic needs to be highlighted. That is that while most folks are talking about the ETF making new 52-week lows, the reality is these new lows are ALL-TIME lows. GDXJ debuted at $25 and the first time it traded below there, it rallied. The second time, late last year, it rallied. The third time in March was the ominous charm as GDXJ is now flirting with $20. Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE: VGK) The Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF was priced at $50 when it debuted in March 2005, a level that has been violated several times for myriad reasons, but the ETF has also found a way to reclaim that debut price. VGK is home to plenty of European-based companies that qualify as blue chip but that doesn't change the fact that they're still European companies. It has been 10 months since VGK last resided above $50. iShares MSCI Thailand Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: THD) We're making an exception with one of the best emerging markets ETFs on the market. THD debuted at $50 in the late part of the first quarter of 2008. Let's just say there are better times for an emerging markets ETF to have come to market because it took THD 17 months to get back above $50. Since the market bottom in 2009, THD has been one of the best ETFs on the market, emerging markets or otherwise and while it has taken its lumps in the past couple of weeks, the long-term outlook for this ETF and the country it tracks are bright. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF hasn't traversed its 2006 debut price of around $38 since the commodities bubble burst in 2008. That sent the ETF tumbling below $18. It's a different world today, so a decline that substantial probably isn't the cards for GDX. However, it must be noted GDX did touch a new 52-week low earlier this week. Combine that with the decline in gold futures and it's not unrealistic to see the selling pressure on GDX intensify if it breaks $38 again."
2012-05-16,Can Things Get Any Worse For Mining ETFs? ,"It's an oft-pondered riddle: How can the shares of mining stocks lag and even fall when the prices of the metals they mine rise? A vexing scenario to be sure and one that gives to way to the harsh reality that if ABC Corp. mines gold or silver and it's stock price doesn't go up in conjunction with the futures price, then it's a lock that ABC's shares are going to be in for significant selling pressure when the price of the metal it extracts from the earth falls. Welcome to that reality. In recent days, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), the two largest ETFs backed by physical holdings of the precious metals in their titles, have given up all of their 2012 gains and turned negative on the year. Those declines began in earnest in March and have accelerated rapidly since the start of April, forming a tidal wave that has sent gold and silver mining ETFs tumbling in even more dramatic fashion. There have been bold calls in defense of the mining ETFs, but to this point, sticking one's neck out for these funds has been akin to volunteering to go to the guillotine. Here's how the landscape for gold and silver mining ETFs shapes up at the moment starting with the group's largest fund, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). GDX will observe its sixth birthday on May 16, but there's not much reason to celebrate. Following Tuesday's 4% drop, the ETF is trading below its $40 debut price, something we've established is a bearish sign. GDX traded as low as $17.80 in 2008 and while it would be a bold call to say the ETF falls that much further, it's worth noting the RSI on GDX's daily chart has only recently started to show an oversold condition. Some have made a bull case for GDX's technicals but that's a dangerous game to play at the moment. As for the Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE: GLDX), let's just say this is a case of bad timing. The fund debuted in November 2011 and has managed to lose almost 58% since then. Tuesday's close at $7.10 wasn't just a 52-week low, it was an all-time low. We should also take this opportunity to welcome the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) to the all-time low club as well. Believe it or not, investors have been putting new capital to work in this ETF. To be precise, GDXJ has seen $90.3 million in inflows over the past week, according ETF Channel data. These days, purchases of GDXJ include an invitation to the catch a falling knife competition as the fund has lost 18% in the past week alone. Making things all the more inviting for short sellers is the fact that, like GDX, GDXJ has only just become oversold and at these levels, there may not be any support until the $14-$15 area. Not surprisingly, silver mining ETFs, of which there are two, have not been peaches either. The Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) lost 5% on volume that was nearly double the daily average on Tuesday. Once SIL violated support at $20 earlier this month, that was one more sign this party was going to turn nasty. This was a $26 ETF in March, To be fair, SIL is not the only silver mining ETF offender. The iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP), which isn't even four months old, has lost a third of its value since its late January debut and is home to less than $2 million in AUM. SIL and SPLV have seen more in the way of redemptions than creations, recently. Duh. Both funds have been damaged by their allocations to Silver Wheaton (NYSE: SLW), Coeur d'Alene (NYSE: CDE) and Pan American Silver (Nasdaq: PAAS), to name a few. Making matters worse are recent statements made on Monday by the World Gold Council that miners need bullion to trade at $1,300 an ounce to survive and will need gold to jump to $3,000 an ounce in five years to remain profitable. That's almost a double from current levels. As investors already know, even if gold and silver get their respective acts together and start marching higher once again, there are no guarantees the miners will follow suit. That much has already been proven. For more on gold mining ETFs, please click HERE."
2012-05-18,"Contrarian ETF Bets to Consider (FCG, IYW)","The current state of affairs in global equity markets can be summed up with one four-letter word: Ugly. Selling in May is working nicely, lifting the fortunes of myriad inverse ETFs, perhaps the best long side bets these days. Unfortunately for the bulls, May's showers could easily give way to June gloom as seasonal weakness sets in for select sectors. At the moment, it's hard to envision fortune favoring the brave, but for those with an appetite for risk, some ETFs that have recently been sold off could make for compelling contrarian plays. iShares Dow Jones U.S. Technology Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYW) If ETFs were to be named after rap albums, IYW would be named for the Jay-Z's Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse. IYW's gift and curse are the same thing: An almost 22% allocation to Apple (Nasdaq: AAP) something that is good when Apple is soaring and bad when it is plunging. IYW makes for an ideal contrarian bet for those that expect Apple will come roaring back and that the broader market will follow. Don't forget the Dow stock with largest weight in that index, IBM (NYSE: IBM), accounts for over 9% of IYW's weight. Overall, five Dow stocks are found among IYW's top-10 holdings, indicating this ETF can be profoundly impacted by the blue chip index's fortunes. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF is the epitome of a contrarian play. Logically, it's hard to get excited about an ETF that tracks commodities producers when prices of that commodity are plummeting. And there's no getting around the fact that before Thursday's almost 4% gain, GDXJ's recent string of lower closes amounted to all-time closing lows. Investors face a conundrum with GDXJ and it revolves around these questions that are tough to answer at the moment. What is the maximum amount of downside the ETF is likely to incur from here? Is the bottom in for gold prices? How long will GDXJ have to be held before decent profits are realized? Market Vectors Vietnam ETF (NYSE: VNM) Readers of this space by now know that we've been bullish on Vietnam and VNM and with good reason. Until the past few days, VNM had been a beacon of strength in otherwise glum market environment, but the sellers have found their way to this ETF, which had been one of the best performers among traditional long ETFs this year. The must-knows regarding VNM's validity as a contrarian play are as follows: The 200-day moving average must hold as support. Investors must accept that growth in the Southeast Asian nation, though slowing, is still vastly superior to what will be found in most developed markets. Government efforts to stimulate the economy and shore up Vietnamese banks, VNM's largest sector weight, must prove successful. First Trust ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index Fund (NYSE: FCG) First, the good news. Natural gas prices have been in rally mode lately, a scenario highlighted by an almost 30% run-up in the United States Natural Gas Fund (NYSE: UNG). The Energy Information Administration has cut its production forecast while raising its demand outlook for natural gas. That has been a boon for UNG, but not for the equity-based FCG. And that's the point with FCG that investors need to be aware. It's a stock ETF whose components produce oil and natural gas and despite the natural gas rally, FCG is being hammered just like any other equity-based ETF. If FCG falls further, the test will be whether support at $14 holds. If it does, and natural gas prices hold steady or keep rising, FCG becomes a fine contrarian idea."
2012-06-04,Reversal in Gold Mining ETFs Could be Bullish Indicator,"Last Wednesday, gold futures hammered out a swing bottom at $1,532. In fact, the precious metal had found support in this area a couple of previous times in May. After putting in this low, gold has been moving aggressively higher and some interesting price action last Friday could be suggesting that prices are going to continue to surge. On that day, gold futures soared around 4% while the Dow fell nearly 300 points. This may be suggesting that investors are shifting their perception of gold once again and are looking at it as a safe-haven asset. Prior to the recent sell-off in risky assets and the corresponding pop in the VIX, gold was trading like most other risk assets and was highly correlated to the S&P 500 and the EUR/USD. The strange price action on Friday seemed to be suggesting that gold may de-couple from other risk assets and benefit from safe-haven flows, similar to what happened in July and August of last year. During Monday's trading session, gold futures are holding the flat-line, just above $1,620. Gold miners, however, are seeing bullish price action as the broader market has turned around in afternoon trade. Both the Market Vectors ETF Trust (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are now trading in positive territory after reversing earlier losses. Both are also sitting at 5-day highs with the GDX trading at its best levels in over a month. Given the interesting activity in the gold market, these two securities could potentially be poised to climb this week. If gold can get back into its former sweet-spot, where it went up on risk aversion as well as bullish economic sentiment, big profits could be ahead in both gold futures as well as the mining ETFs."
2012-06-05,"ETFs to Watch June 6, 2012 (GDXJ, XLE, UUP)","Here is the ETF Professor's ETF Watch List for Wednesday June 6, 2012. Keep an eye on the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE). The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is on fire. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE: XHB) had a nice day on Tuesday. Emerging markets plays of the day: Market Vectors Brazil ETF (NYSE: BRF), iShares MSCI Chile Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: ECH) and the ProShares UltraShort FTSE China 25 (NYSE: FXP). Forex play of the day: PowerShares DB Dollar Bullish (NYSE: UUP). Bond play of the day: SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE: JNK)."
2012-06-06,Positioning Your Portfolio for More Fed Easing,"The recent mantra to Fed action was buy gold as a hedge against the dollar, but with the gold (NYSE: GLD) being the second-most crowded trade to (NASDAQ: AAPL), what are other alternatives? (Note: that's not an actual statistic, just an observation). There are many different views on the best hedges to the Fed, but let's see what the data has to say. Gold obviously is the winner, having nearly doubled from the 2008 lows through the end of QE2 and increasing another 14% during QE2. Miners have not performed as well, though small and mid cap miners (NYSE: GDXJ) have outperformed their larger cap (NYSE: GDX) brethren. Silver (NYSE: SLV) has lagged its yellow cousin, as it actually has industrial value. Really, only Apple has outperformed gold since the Fed has attempted to save the world. Another obvious trade is to short the dollar (NYSE: UUP), especially as the dollar has been strong recently. However, the dollar was stronger ahead of both of the quantitative easing programs, with the dollar index trading well north of 85 prior to each. The high so far has only been just over 83. The sell-offs following balance sheet expansion by the Fed have ended around 75, meaning that traders could pick up about 12% by shorting the dollar (NYSE: UDN). Shorting bonds have been the loser in all of this, with treasury bonds (NYSE: TLT) continuing to fall to record low yields. Being short bonds (NYSE: TBT) has been a losing trade, with the TBT down some 75% since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008. Mortgage Backed Securities (NYSE: MBB) have been winners, with the Barclays MBS Index rallying some 12.5% since the 2009 lows. However, with fed members hinting that the next round of easing could focus on MBS only, they may be a winner. Copper (NYSE: JJC) almost tripled after QE1 and other stimulus policies and rallied another 50% from there after QE2. Copper may be a place for investors to put some capital if they believe that more QE is on the way. Oil has also benefited from QE, and so have oil companies. For those wishing to have less volatility than commodities, investing in miners or energy companies (NYSE: XLE) may make more sense. In general, it will be a risk-on environment, so those wanting a more broad -based allocation to risk may wish to invest in a diversified portfolio, such as the UBS Fisher-Gartman Risk On ETN (NYSE: ONN). This ETN is a portfolio of various risk assets, such as Aussie Dollar (NYSE: FXA) futures, Canadian Dollar (NYSE: FXC) futures, crude oil, equities, and bonds. We know the playbook: buy gold, buy stocks, buy commodities. But now we know exactly which ones to buy. Good luck and good trading."
2012-06-06,"5 Mining ETFs Your Broker Forgot to Mention (PSAU, GLDX, RING)","Sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's a bad thing, but it's clear that sentiment can change on a dime in this market. That has certainly proven to be a good thing recently for the shares of many precious metal miners and the ETFs that track them. Left for dead as recently as mid-May, it appears as though the miners not only have their respective acts together, but that they want to participate in the upside being offered by the metals they extract from the earth as well. Since May 15, the returns offered by the three major precious metal mining ETFs are nothing short of staggering and the numbers are all the more impressive when remembering this is a risk of, let's discard anything high beta market environment. Since May 15, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest precious metals mining ETF, has jumped more than 18%. GDX's junior counterpart, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is up more than 13% while the Globla X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) is flirting with a gain of 11%. That trio is the Big 3 of precious metals mining funds, but there are other options to consider in this space, some of which your broker is probably neglecting to mention. Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE: GLDX) For all the fanfare that mining ETFs have been subject to, the Global X Gold Explorers ETF has flown under the radar since its November 2010 debut. Today, the fund has almost $31.5 million in assets under management and has surged almost 15% in the past two weeks. As of this writing on June 6, GLDX is up almost 4% on volume that's nearly double the daily average indicating investors are starting to warm to this sub-$10 fund. GLDX is in fact quite different than GDX. The Global X fund offers no exposure to U.S.-based companies as Canada and Australia combine for essentially all of the fund's country weight. GLDX's top-10 holdings account for about 56% of the fund's weight and the ETF has an expense ratio of 0.65%. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG) The Quad G's is now 15 months old and isn't all that large with just $4.4 million in AUM, but this could be the time the unheralded fund solidifies itself. Up 15.2% since May 15, GGGG has outperformed GLDX and GDXJ over that time. GGGG is also cheaper than GLDX with an expense ratio of 0.59%. Home to almost 30 stocks, GGGG's country allocation is heavily tilted toward Canada and South Africa as those countries represent over 60% of the fund's weight. U.S. investors are probably familiar with some of the fund's top-10 holdings such as Eldorado Gold (NYSE: EGO), Kinross Gold (NYSE: KGC) and Allied Nevada (NYSE: ANV). Perhaps the most important thing to note about GGGG is that it has one of the lowest correlations to gold of any mining ETF, as ETFdb.com recently noted. PowerShares Global Gold and Precious Metals Portfolio (Nasdaq: PSAU) The PowerShares Global Gold and Precious Metals Portfolio has been around for almost four years and since this fund is a direct competitor to the dominant GDX, it often goes ignored. PSAU and GDX do have plenty of overlap in terms of holdings. For example, Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) and Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) are top-10 holdings in both ETFs. PSAU's 14.1% jump since May 15 is impressive, but that lags GDX, a situation we suspect is attributable to GDX's larger weights to select gold miners. The aforementioned trio of stocks accounts for over 43% of GDX's weight, but barely more than 25% of PSAU's girth. iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP) The iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund came to market earlier this year as a direct rival to the Global X Silver Miners ETF, but SLVP has struggled to attract assets. That should change as sentiment towards mining funds improves and it should be noted SLVP does have an advantage of SIL: The iShares product is cheaper. Still, it can't be ignored that since May 15, SLVP is up almost 6% (nice), but SIL is up almost 11% (better). iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund (NYSE: RING) Home to one of the more appropriate tickers in the ETF universe, the iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund debuted at the end of January as a direct rival to GDX and PSAU. Competing with GDX's first-to-market advantage is tough as that fund has almost $9 billion in AUM. To RING's credit, it has almost $31 million in AUM and is cheaper than both GDX and PSAU while holding many of the same stocks. More importantly and almost completely under the radar, RING has surged almost 18% since May 15, making it the second-best performer of all the funds we've highlighted here behind only GDX.

2012-06-07,"Under The Hood: An Unheralded Mining Play (TSXV, GDX)","Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke didn't do gold bugs any favors on Thursday when he refused to walk down Quantitative Easing Boulevard a third time. While the central bank chief did say the Fed stands ready to act, those comments cannot be taken to mean QE3 is imminent and that proved to be problematic for gold and gold miners. Ah, yes. The gold miners, home to so much good recently mining stocks and ETFs crumbled in the wake of what Bernanke did not say. Sure, it can be said the likes of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE: GDXJ) were near-term overbought and due for a pullback, but Thursday's action was quite nasty. However, traders might want to take advantage this distribution day to consider some backdoor approaches to gold miners. Let the dust settle for a day and then have a look at an ETF such as the IndexIQ Canada Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: CNDA) or the unheralded Global X S&P/TSX Venture 30 Canada ETF (NYSE: TSXV). The Global X S&P/TSX Venture 30 Canada ETF, which is just 15 months old and charges an expense ratio of 0.75% per year, isn't heavily traded, but the index employs a liquidity-driven weighting scheme and each stock must trade on average, at least 100,000 shares-per-month during the 6 months preceding the rebalance reference date, according to Standard & Poor's. So while TSXV's average daily volume of just 1,900 shares per day may seem off-putting, the fund's overall liquidity may prove to be a pleasant surprise to some. Not that this is an ETF for income investors, but TSXV has a 2.77% yield, a nice surprise as well, and that's better than what S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average tracking ETFs offer. As an ETF that embraces the commodities/materials aspect of the Canadian economy, TSXV has seen its shares slide 7.3% in the past month has the commodities trade has been punished. A 38% allocation to energy stocks has obviously been a problem for the fund, but TSXV's secret sauce for a potential rebound is its exposure to gold miners, something the ETF is rarely given credit for. Metals miner Rio Alto is TSXV's second-largest constituent with a weight of 11%. Of the ETF's top-12 holdings, ten are engaged in the mining of gold and silver and those stocks combine for over 40% of the fund's total weight. Overall, more than half of TSXV's weight is devoted to precious metals mining firms, implying this is an ETF that will benefit as the miners regain prominence and start either participating in gold and silver's upside or outperforming the underlying metals outright. TSXV's caveat isn't the volume or the fees, it's the oil exposure, which is to say more quantitative easing would surely help this fund because there's no getting around the fact that oil demand is slack at the moment. Looking at the chart, the $9.25-$9.60 area is probably safe to nibble on TSXV with a stop at $8.40. If the 200-day moving average is cleared, TSXV could run to $11.50-$12.

2012-08-08,S&P Capital IQ Bullish on Gold Miners,"It is not a secret that shares of gold miner ETFs have performed disappointingly relative to gold futures. And it is also not a secret that this scenario has played out for a long enough time period that calling a bottom in gold miners has been hazardous. However, the prevailing bull case for gold miners says signs of life will soon emerge. In a research note, S&P Capital IQ said it remains positive on gold's outlook for this year and 2013. S&P Capital IQ provided a number of reasons for its bullish outlook on the yellow metal. First, given that the Federal Reserve is committed to keeping short-term interest rates at near zero through 2014, we see no opportunity cost for buying and holding gold anytime soon, S&P said in the note. Second, despite higher gold prices, global mine production has been stagnant for over a decade. According to data compiled by Gold Fields Minerals Service, a U.K.-based metals consulting firm and publisher, global mine output in 2011 totaled 2,809 tons, up eight percent from 2,602 tons in 1999. We believe production will remain stagnant for the next several years, as old mines are becoming depleted and are not being replaced to the extent needed to significantly lift output. S&P also cited volatility among major global currencies and elevated concerns over solvency of international sovereign debt. The research provider added, In our view, the threat of debt defaults increases the appeal of gold as a safe haven asset. In addition, rising money supply in the U.S. could be a catalyst to drive gold higher this year, according to S&P. In terms of individual gold miners, S&P has a five-star rating on Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and four-star ratings on Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) and Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD). Those three stocks combine for about 30 percent of Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). With almost $8.1 billion in assets under management, GDX is the largest ETF tracking gold mining equities. GDX has struggled this year, falling almost 15 percent even as ETFs backed by physical gold have risen. The SPDR Gold shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU), the two largest gold ETFs, each rose about three percent year-to-date. Small-cap gold miners have performed even worse than their large-cap counterparts year-to-date. During this period, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) has fallen almost 20 percent. Unlike some of its peers, GDXJ has some mid-cap exposure and allocations to silver miners. The fund has nearly $2.3 billion in AUM. S&P did not include ratings for either gold miner ETF in the research note. For more on mining ETFs, click here."

2012-08-23,A Look at How Top Hedge Funds Are Positioned in Gold,"The gold trade has always been controversial. Obviously, gold investors have done extremely well over the last decade, but many financial types still scoff at holding a large precious metals position. While gold bugs receive frequent derision, the reality is that many of the savviest money managers in the world are, in fact, gold bugs. Hedge funds recently filed their second quarter 13-Fs outlining their long equity positions, and this allows us to see how some of the top funds are positioned in gold. The 13-F filings, however, do not cover holdings of physical gold, so while they are not a full accounting, they do provide a glimpse into who is still involved in the precious metals trade. Greenlight Capital - This hedge fund is run by noted short-seller and value investor David Einhorn, who happens to be a big fan of gold. In fact, Greenlight actually has a gold-denominated fund. In 2009, Einhorn sold his position in the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) and bought physical gold instead. The word is that Greenlight stores its physical gold at an undisclosed vault located in Manhattan. Rest assured, there is a lot of gold in that vault -- hundreds of millions of dollars worth. In addition to Greenlight's position in physical gold, the hedge fund also reported positions in Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and the Market Vectors Gold Mining Trust ETF (NYSE::GDX). Greenlight's position in Barrick amounted to around $73 million as of the fund's last filing. The Gold Miners ETF position was worth a whopping $269 million. Based on what we know about David Einhorn and how his fund is positioned, it is clear that he still likes gold as an investment. Paulson & Co. - Similar to Greenlight Capital, John Paulson's hedge fund also offers a gold-denominated fund. Paulson is probably the best-known gold bug in the world at this point. Paulson & Co.'s most recent 13-F is full of gold miners and the hedge fund is still holding a giant position in the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD). The first company that shows up in the filing is Agnico-Eagle Mines (NYSE: AEM), a Canadian gold miner. The hedge fund's position in Agnico-Eagle was valued at just over $41 million. Paulson also has a nearly $43 million position in less well-known miner Allied Nevada Gold (NYSE: ANV). Paulson & Co.'s 13-F also shows that the fund continues to hold a very large position in South African gold miner AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE: AU). In fact, the fund is the largest holder of the company, with a 8.50% stake valued at roughly $1.13 billion. Now, that is a position! Next up, is Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX). Paulson has a $34 million stake in this well-known gold miner. The filing also shows a $231 million position in Gold Fields Limited (NYSE: GFI). Given the sheer number of gold miners that show up in Paulson & Co's filing, it is clear that the billionaire is covering all of the bases to make sure his investors do well if gold continues to rise like he expects. Paulson has a $45 million position in IAMGOLD Corp. (NYSE: IAG) and a new $189 million stake in NovaGold Resources (NYSE: NG). The hedge fund also owns nearly $84 million worth of Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD). Finally, there is, Paulson & Co.'s massive stake in the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD). This position was valued at a whopping $3.39 billion as of the last filing period. Given the size and scope of Paulson's gold holdings, there is little doubt that he and his investors have as much riding on the yellow metal as anyone in the world. Soros Fund Management - George Soros is an interesting guy. He is a diehard liberal, but also an uber-capitalist. Even at 82, George Soros might be the best trader on the planet. He didn't make his money like Warren Buffett, who is a buy and hold guy, but rather by moving in and out of markets with gigantic size. In recent years, Soros has been trading the SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD). This makes sense, as it is one of the most liquid securities on Earth and is big enough to accommodate the size he trades. As of Soros Fund Management's last 13-F filing, he was riding a roughly $137 million position in the ETF. Soros also owns the two prominent gold mining ETFs. His fund had a $45 million and $46 million stake in the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). He also owned a very small position in Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), which was valued at a little over $6 million. While Soros is not nearly as invested in gold as Einhorn and Paulson, it is also hard to gauge exactly what he is doing from his 13-F filing because he is known to move in and out of positions with fairly high frequency."
2012-08-28,3 Precious Metals ETFs Your Broker Forgot to Mention,"With $68.9 billion in assets under management, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) is the second-largest ETF in the world. The iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) is not exactly tiny with $10 billion in AUM, nor can the $9.5 billion iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) be considered diminutive. On the mining front, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has almost $8.4 billion in AUM while the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is home to a healthy $2.6 billion in assets. In other words, it is unusual to find an exchange-traded product that offers exposure to the precious metals complex that can be considered anonymous or obscure. Whether its a futures play, a fund backed by physical holdings or an equity-based fund, there are a few precious metals ETFs and ETNs out there that brokers and investors probably have not heard of. With gold and silver looking as though they want to make new highs, there is no time like the present to become acquainted with some new precious metals plays. ETFS Physical White Metals Basket Shares (NYSE: WITE) For the investor that already has gold exposure and just cannot decide between the white metals, there is the ETFS Physical White Metals Basket Shares. Nearly two-years-old, WITE uses a basket approach to give investors exposure to silver, platinum and palladium. WITE currently holds almost 49,500 ounces of silver, 495 ounces of platinum and 396 ounces of palladium, according to ETF Securities data. Despite the soaring popularity of precious metals ETFs in recent years, WITE has struggled to capture investors' attention. The fund has just over $34 million in AUM and average daily volume below 1,900 shares. That shows investors are missing out on a good thing as WITE is up nine percent year-to-date. PowerShares DB Precious Metals Fund (NYSE: DBP) With almost $323 million in AUM, calling the PowerShares DB Precious Metals Fund anonymous is a stretch. Overlooked might be the more appropriate descriptor. Where DBP differs from funds such as GLD and SLV is its fees. DBP charges 0.79 percent per year, which is high among metals funds, particularly when considering DBP has no storage costs. Then again, futures-based exchange-traded products have a reputation for high fees and DBP does live up to that billing. The fund tracks the DBIQ Optimum Yield Precious Metals Index, which is 80 percent allocated to gold and 20 percent allocated to silver. DBP is up 6.3 percent year-to-date, but that is barely better than GLD and more than 400 basis points worse than SLV. iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund (NYSE: RING) The iShares MSCI Global Gold Miners Fund is another good example of a new ETF that has shown it will be around for a while, though it is debatable that many investors even know that much about this mining play. RING debuted in late January and now has $32.4 million in AUM. That is not a bad haul, but that total also indicates RING has its hands full in terms of competing with GDX's first-to-market advantage. GDX and RING actually make for an interesting competition. RING's 0.39 percent expense ratio is 13 basis points below GDX's, but the Market Vectors fund has sharply outperformed the iShares ETF over the past three months. At the very least, RING is off to a better start than the iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP). SLVP has made almost no inroads on the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL), the dominant silver miners fund. For more on mining ETFs, click here."

2012-09-25,These ETFs Have Topped Tech's Big 3,"The Nasdaq trio of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) have been, to put it delicately, impressive over the past three months. Amid new product introductions and favorable sentiment toward the technology sector, these names have buttressed their status as growth darlings. In the past three months, Amazon has jumped 17 percent, which trails the 20.8 percent Apple has gained over the same time. Both pale in comparison to Google, which surged almost 36.2 percent since late July. Investors that bought any of the three in July are probably quite happy. Those with the capital to have invested in all three are sitting on an average three-month gain of 24.6 percent. Said another way, owning the trio of Amazon, Apple and Google for the past three months delivered returns that are 50 percent better than what the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) has done in all of 2012. Yes, it is hard to find ETFs that have outperformed the average gain of the aforementioned tech trio over the past 90 days. Hard, but not impossible. Take a look at the following funds: Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) The small-cap cousin to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), itself recently an impressive performer, has simply been on fire. GDXJ is on pace for a 30 percent third-quarter gain. Even if it stayed in neutral until the end of the quarter, the ETF will end up having outpaced Amazon and Apple by healthy margins. The mining ETFs have finally stopped frustrating investors and are outpacing ETFs backed by physical gold such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), as ETF Trends notes. To its credit, GDX has slightly outperformed Amazon in the past three months as well. Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) For as good as the gold miners have been in the past 90 days, the silver miners are having a say in the matter as well. In that time, the Global X Silver Miners ETF, by far the largest of the two silver miners ETFs, has jumped 31.2 percent. That run easily trumps the returns offered by Amazon and Apple over the same time and it also beats the average of Amazon, Apple and Google. The rival iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners Fund (NYSE: SLVP) has been stout as well, surging nearly 29 percent. Market Vectors Egypt ETF (NYSE: EGPT) Simply put, the Market Vectors Egypt ETF has been on a torrid pace this year. It is one of the best-performing country-specifc ETFs tracking any type of market, developed, emerging or frontier. What makes EGPT's performance all the more noteworthy is that the ETF is soaring in the face of Middle East headlines that cannot be considered favorable. A case can be made that EGPT is overbought at current levels. Then again, some might argue the ETF still has some upside ahead because it still trades well below where resided before the onset of the 2011 Arab Spring. In the past three months, EGPT is up a Google-esque 35 percent, which is to say a tiny ETF tracking one of the most politically volatile countries in the world and a frontier market at that has been twice as good as Amazon over the same and almost 1,500 basis points better than Apple.

2012-11-15,"Soros Adds to Gold Miner ETF Positions, Raises GLD Stake","Billionaire investor George Soros, who as recently as late 2011 said gold was an asset bubble, now appears quite bullish on the yellow metal and the companies that extract it from the earth. During the third quarter, Soros Fund Management LLC added to its investment in the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the second-largest ETF in the world by assets. The firm raised its interest in GLD to 1.3 million shares from 884,400 shares, according to an SEC filing. Even at 1.3 million shares. Soros Fund Management owns a small percentage of GLD's shares outstanding, which stood at 443.2 million as of November 14. The filing also indicates Soros Fund Management has boosted its holdings of ETFs that own shares of gold miners. An August SEC filing showed the firm held 1 million shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and nearly 2.4 million shares of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). The November filing indicates Soros has more than doubled his GDX stake to 2.32 million shares and now holds a sizable chunk of call options on the ETF as well. The firm's position in GDXJ has not changed, according to the filing. Since mid-August, GLD has jumped 6.6 percent while GDXJ has soared 5.7 percent. GDX has risen 3.3 percent over the same time. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) combine for a third of GDX's weight. Soros also slightly added to his position in the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). The firm owned 350,000 shares of XME as of the August filing, but the more recent November filing indicates that stake has risen to 353,400 shares and the firm also owns call options on that ETF. XME does hold some gold miners, but the fund is heavily allocated to coal and steel names such as Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE). Soros also holds a stake in the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) as well as call options on that position. Other ETFs that Soros Fund Management holds interests in according to the November filing include the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP), the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE: KBE) and the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). The firm also owns options on the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM) and the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI). EEM is the second-largest emerging markets ETF by assets while FXI is the largest China fund. For more on ETFs, click here."

2012-11-30,Even The Pros Struggle With Gold Miners ETFs,"A frequent point of frustration for investors during gold's multi-year bull market has been the inability of mining stocks and ETFs to keep pace with bullion. The statistics highlight that frustration. Over the past five years, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is up just two percent while the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), which offers exposure to physical gold, has more than doubled. Over the past three years, GLD has jumped 45.3 percent while GDX is off 3.3 percent. Making the situation even worse is volatility. As in GDX's volatility over the past three years 32.1 percent compared to 18 percent for GLD. Even some of the brightest minds on Wall Streets have struggled with positions in GDX and other mining ETFs. Take the examples of Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn and Soros Fund Management's George Soros. Simply put, these gentlemen did not attain legendary status in the financial community by being wrong very often. In pop culture parlance, Einhorn and Soros are like Charlie Sheen. They win...a lot. However, the disconnect between gold and gold miners can test even the savviest of investors. In third quarter of 2011, Greenlight pared its holdings of bullion and moved into GDX. At the time, Einhorn highlighted the aforementioned disconnect between gold and shares of the miners that extract the yellow metal from the earth, Bloomberg reported. Given the challenging macroeconomic environment, we intend, for the foreseeable future, to continue holding a significant position in gold, Bloombeg reported, citing a Greenlight filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Greenlight's most recent 13F filing shows the firm held about $315 million worth of GDX at the end of the third quarter. There is a fair chance the hedge fund is in the red on that position. In the third quarter 2011, the lowest closing price for GDX was just under $54 while the highest close was just under $66. Today, the ETF barely hovers above $47, indicating that holders of the ETF with a cost basis in the mid-$50s would have had to do some dollar-cost averaging in the second and third quarters of this year when the ETF slumped. This is not to say Greenlight is out of the money by $10 a share on GDX. However, it is also fair to say that the largest gold miners ETF has not been another Lehman Brothers or Green Mountain Coffee (NASDAQ: GMCR) for Einhorn. At least not yet. As for Soros, at least it can be said that he holds some shares of GLD. In fact, Soros Fund Management added 884,400 shares of the world's largest gold ETF during the third quarter to bring its stake in that ETF to 1.3 million shares at the end of the quarter. However, Soros also boosted his stake in GDX. At the end of August, Soros Fund Management owned 1 million shares of GDX. That total swelled to 2.32 million shares, according to the firm's most recent 13F. Again, it depends on when Soros was adding to GDX, but the ETF spent all of September and October trading above where it resides today. Beyond GDX, Soros has another potential problem in the form of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the small- and mid-cap equivalent to GDX. In the past year, GDXJ has plunged nearly 29 percent. Soros Fund Management owned 2.4 million shares of GDXJ at the end of the third quarter. Since the end of the second quarter of 2011, GDXJ has shed 35 percent of its value. Things have not been much better for the miners in recent weeks. GDXJ is off 8.3 percent in the past month while GDX has given up 7.8 percent over the same time. Smaller investors that, like Einhorn and Soros, see value in the miners can implement a hedge. After all, that is what hedge funds are supposed to do, right? That hedge, and it is one that should be used over short-term time frames, is the Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST). The aptly named DUST has jumped 19.4 percent in the past month. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-01-10,Gold Miner ETFs Soar Despite Collapsed African Barrick Talks,"Shares of the $8.5 billion Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) are trading higher by more than two percent today despite news that a Chinese buyer is stepping away from talks to possibly acquire a controlling interest in African Barrick Gold. African Barrick is publicly traded unit of mining giant Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), GDX's largest constituent with a weight of 12.1 percent. Shares of Barrick are also higher by more than two percent despite news of the collapsed African Barrick talks. China National Gold Group and Barrick could not agree on a price for a 73.9 percent stake in African Barrick, the Wall Street Journal reported. Perhaps surprisingly, Barrick and GDX have fought off those headlines to move higher. Despite gold futures moving higher in 2012 for a twelfth consecutive year, GDX plunged about 14 percent. Even with today's move, investors seem to be split regarding the near-term fate for GDX and related ETFs. In a research note published today, Street One Financial Vice President Paul Weisbruch says that more than $400 million in assets have departed GDX over the past week. Conversely, Weisbruch also says recent call options activity in GDX and its small-cap equivalent, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), has been above average. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) is another ETF that is getting on the good times for gold miners today. NUGT, the triple-leveraged equivalent of GDX, is soaring by almost 6.3 percent in what is looking one of the ETF's best days in months. Over the past year, NUGT has plunged nearly 56 percent. NUGT and GDXJ have seen net creations recently, but not of notable asset size. The Miners have lagged broad based equity benchmarks terribly in the trailing one and five year periods, so investors in that space are likely looking for a lift of off recent lows, said Weisbruch.

That is the same methodology used by popular Market Vectors ETFs such as the Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX), the Market Vectors Semiconductor ETF (NYSE: SMH) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). KWT's top-10 holdings currently include First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), Trina Solar (NYSE: TSL) and SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR).

2013-02-04,"As Mining ETFs Wilt, This One Stands Tall ","Following glum performances in 2012, gold mining stocks and the corresponding ETFs are up to more of the same in early 2013. A common criticism of gold mining equities and ETFs has been that the miners have not been, at least not in recent memory, participating in the upside of the yellow metal they extract from the earth. That leaves gold miners vulnerable to increase downside potential when gold futures languish, a scenario that is playing out this year. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) was off 1.05 percent heading into the start of trading Monday. Things were for worse for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), which is off 10 percent year-to-date and that includes Monday's modest gain. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) has been better though that is not saying much. With Monday's one percent decline, GDXJ is now off 7.8 percent since the start of the year. The situation is worse with silver. Year-to-date, the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV) is up 2.5 percent, but the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) has plunged over 10 percent. Investors looking to participate in upside for miners do not need to look for. They just need to shift their view away from the usual suspects, also known as gold and silver miners because one small ETF has delivered big returns to start the year. That fund is the First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund (NASDAQ: PLTM). Buoyed by sharply higher platinum at the hands of more labor strife in South Africa, among other catalysts, platinum futures have surged to start 2013. The ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT), which is backed by physical holdings of the white metal, have jumped over eight percent to start 2013. The First Trust ISE Global Platinum Index Fund has been solid as well. Actually, PLTM's 4.7 percent year-to-date gain is downright stellar in comparison to the aforementioned gold and silver miners ETFs. Some platinum miners produce more than just that metal. Those companies produce other platinum-group metals, including palladium. That has been a good thing this year as palladium prices have soared thanks to robust auto sales data in the U.S.. Palladium is used in the production of catalytic converters in most cars produced in China and the U.S., the world's two largest automobile markets. Improved auto sales have helped lift the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) by more than seven percent year-to-date. Combined, bullishness in platinum and palladium futures is clearly helping PLTM. Investors might think that playing a country-specific with platinum-group exposure is a wise idea. In theory, it should be and the play would be the iShares MSCI South Africa Index Fund (NYSE: EZA) because South Africa is the world's largest platinum-producing nation and the second-largest palladium producer behind Russia. That has not been the case as EZA has offered essentially no correlation to platinum and palladium futures this year as evidenced by the fund's 5.8 percent year-to-date tumble. On the other hand, South Africa accounts for almost 36.4 percent of PLTM's country weight, by far that ETF's largest country exposure. That indicates PLTM has not been hampered by labor unrest in South Africa to this point. Canada and the U.K. combine for over 30 percent of PLTM's weight, leaving a 7.25 allocation to Russia as the ETF's only remaining legitimate political risk. Russia could actually be a catalyst for PLTM going forward as some here."

2013-02-15,"Einhorn, Soros Differ on Gold Mining ETFs","The woes of gold mining stocks and ETFs, in particular the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), have been a frequent topic of conversation among traders for over a year now. The story goes like this: Gold miners vexed traders and investors by not rising in unison with gold futures. That much is evident by the fact that GDX, the largest gold miners ETF by assets, is down 31 percent over the past two years. Over the same time, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the largest ETF backed by holdings of physical gold, is up 17 percent. Not surprisingly as ETFs such as GLD have recently faltered (that fund is off 6.3 percent in the past 90 days), the losses have been worse for the likes of GDX. Over the same 90-day period, GDX is down 13.1 percent, more than double GLD's loss. Ongoing downward spirals for GDX and its constituents might be the reason George Soros parted ways with a significant chunk of his stake in that ETF during the fourth quarter. Soros owned 1.5 million shares of GDX at the end of the fourth quarter, compared 2.3 million shares at the end of the third. \ Soros also sold 400,000 shares of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) during the fourth quarter to bring his stake in that ETF to 2 million shares. David Einhorn apparently has a different view of the matter. Einhorn's Greenlight Capital owned approximately 6 million shares of GDX at the end of the fourth quarter, according to the hedge fund's most recent 13F filing. That is roughly the same amount of GDX Greenlight owned at the end of the previous quarter. While this does not amount to a Bill Ackman versus Carl Icahn type of tussle, it looks like Soros was right to trim his exposure to GDX and GDXJ. On the other hand, Einhorn is dealing with a falling knife in GDX. On February 5, Chris Kimble of the eponymous Kimble Charting Solutions noted that if GDX violated support around $42.15, the ETF was doomed to more downside. That was just nine trading days ago and today GDX is off more than three percent on volume that has already surpassed the daily average. The ETF is struggling to hold the $40 mark. Making matters all the more dangerous for Einhorn and his fellow GDX investors is the fact that gold futures are at a critical juncture. This week, bullion has struggled to stay above the psychologically important $1,650 per ounce area. As Kimble notes, further deterioration from here could mean gold futures test $1,300. That would mean GLD would likely fall to around $130, a roughly 16 percent decline from current levels. While it must be noted that GDX does not move with GLD on a dollar-for-dollar basis, it also cannot be forgotten that the former's recent slide is more than twice as worse as the latter's. If that trend holds, gold futures do test $1,300 and GLD falls 16 percent, GDX could tumble 30 percent or more. That means the Direxion Daily Gold 3X Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) becomes all the more alluring. As it is, when accounting for Friday's gain of more than 10 percent, DUST is up more than 39 percent in the past month. As a leveraged ETF, DUST is not meant to be held for long time frames, but the returns indicate that it is the best way to play gold miners in the short-term. For more on gold miners, click here."
2013-02-20,Gold's Death Cross Hastens Mining ETFs Death Spirals,"The big news out of the gold pits Wednesday is that futures violated the psychologically important $1,600 an ounce level. At this writing, Comex-traded gold is trading just under $1,568 per ounce. Arguably, the bigger news is the technical condition gold's slide has caused. That being the ominous death cross, the technical scenario under which a security's 50-day moving average falls below its 200-day line. It happened with gold futures and it would appear that it is just a matter of time before the same fate befalls the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). Not surprisingly, gold trading at six-month lows and violating key technical areas has proven to be another nail in the coffin of gold mining ETFs. Earlier this month, Benzinga reported on looming technical issues for the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). That report cited a technical analyst that said if GDX, the largest gold miners ETF by assets, fellow below $42.15, the bad times could keep on coming. As of Wednesday, that call has proven to be 100 accurate. GDX is off four percent in late trading and trading around $37.80. Should GDX closed below $38 today, it will be the first time the ETF has done that since July 2009. GDX's all-time low of $17.80 seen in October 2008 is obviously a long way off, but at around $38, the ETF is trading near a price that it saw soon after its May 2006 debut. Regarding the death cross, GDX beat bullion to the punch, having committed that offense early this year. GDX is not alone. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is off 3.8 percent today and is trading at $16 as of this writing. That would be a new all-time closing low for the ETF, which debuted in November 2009. If GDXJ closes right at $16, it will have lost 38.4 percent since coming to market. Like GDX, GDXJ made its death cross several weeks. Weakness in gold mining shares, a prominent theme for two years now, if not longer, and that weakness can be felt at the highest levels of the hedge fund universe. As Benzinga reported last week, George Soros has been paring his exposure to GDX and GDXJ. Investors in David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital may be hoping that the hedge fund is behind some of today's selling pressure in GDX. Greenlight owned about 6 million shares of GDX at the end of the fourth quarter, according to a recent 13F filing. That position, if Greenlight still maintains it, is certainly worth less today than it was at the end of last year. GDX spent much of October and November trading in the high $40s and low $50s before diving to the mid $40s in December. Not surprisingly, today's worst offender in the gold mining ETF realm is a leveraged play, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT). Down over 10 percent today and more than 34 percent in the past month, NUGT languishes below $6 a share. In the world of leveraged ETFs, a fund with that price tag will only keep it for so long before it travels down Reverse Split Boulevard. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) will not be seeing a reverse split anytime soon. DUST, the one gold mining ETF that is worth a look these days, is up 51.5 percent in the past month and that does NOT include today's 12.1 percent gain. For more on mining ETFs, click here."

2013-04-02,Further Confirmation Materials ETFs Are Imperiled,"With the S&P 500 up about 0.7 percent Tuesday and having touched a new record high, it is not hard to find the laggards among sector ETFs. There are a few funds tracking the oil and semiconductor sub-segments that are in the red, but those losses are not yet alarming. The real cause for concern remains the materials sector. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is down 0.54 percent today, and while that may not sound like much, remember that XLB was by far the worst performer of the nine sector SPDRs in the first quarter. XLB's first-quarter gain was not even half of what the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) returned. Tuesday may be just one day, but the problem for XLB and other materials ETFs is that this far from the worst day this year these funds have been laggards. As lower beta sectors such as consumer staples and health care have lead the broader market higher, materials names have under-performed perhaps foreshadowing imminent declines. XLB is not the only materials ETF offender, either. As Benzinga noted on Monday, the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) is in serious technical trouble. That ETF is off another 1.5 percent today and has now lost more than 16.5 percent year-to-date. With gold futures being hammered, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are both off more than three percent. In further proof that traders hate gold mining stocks and reverse splits are a joke, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bull Shares (NYSE: NUGT) is down nearly 11 percent today, the ETF's first trading day after undergoing a four-for-one reverse split. There is more bad news. The iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials Index Fund (NYSE: IYM) is flirting with support in the $68.80 area. A break there probably takes the ETF back to $65-$66. If the Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW) cannot hold $87, it likely returns to $82. Another way of illustrating the dark clouds hanging over materials ETFs right now is this. Look at a heat map of inverse ETFs and exclude the ones that are trading on a post-split basis today. The noteworthy, legitimate gainer is the ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN), which is close to staging a breakout of its own. SMN is not the largest nor is it the most heavily traded inverse ETF out there. However, it is up nearly one percent on a day when the S&P 500 hit a new record high and that is not a good sign for long materials ETFs. For more on materials ETFs, click here."
2013-04-15,Einhorn Could Have a Mining ETF Problem,"Last week, when shares of J.C. Penney (NYSE: JCP) plunged and rumors about Herbalife (NYSE: HLF) going private surfaced, plenty of folks vilified Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital due to the hedge fund's positions in those stocks. Those who enjoy highlighting hedge fund manager trades gone awry may want to consider Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn for this week's wall of shame. Emphasis on may because until the first-quarter 13F filings start rolling in, no one knows for certain whether or not Einhorn's hedge fund still maintains a position in the downtrodden Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). What is not debatable is the fact that Greenlight held 6 million shares of GDX at the end of the fourth quarter. That is the same amount the hedge fund owned at the end of the third quarter of 2012 and, to put things delicately, that trade is not going in Einhorn's favor. GDX, which is home to 31 stocks including Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), was down 31.6 percent year-to-date at the start of trading Monday. That does not include the ETF's 6.8 percent Monday slide. Again, investors will not know if Einhorn still holds a stake in GDX until the first-quarter 13F filings are published, but assuming no changes have been made to that position, Einhorn probably has some explaining to do to Greenlight clients. GDX closed just over $47 on January 2. Even if the ETF closes at $31 today, Einhorn's position would be about $16 per share underwater equaling a loss of $96 million. To be fair to Einhorn, he is not the only noteworthy hedge fund that is being taken to the cleaners by gold miners. At the end of the fourth quarter, John Paulson's Paulson & Co. held stakes in several GDX holdings, including Barrick, Agnico-Eagle Miners (NYSE: AEM), AngloGold Ashanti (NYSE: AU), Gold Fields (NYSE: GFI) and Randgold Resources (NASDAQ: GOLD). Those stocks combine for roughly 29 percent of GDX's weight. Paulson & Co. also owned over 21.8 million shares of the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) at the end of the fourth quarter. The largest ETF backed by physical gold is now down more than 19 percent this year. George Soros may be having some problems with GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) as well. While Soros did reduce his positions in those ETFs by 800,000 and 400,000 shares during the fourth quarter, he still owned 1.5 million shares of GDX and about two million shares of GDXJ at the end of the quarter. Including today's loss, GDXJ has lost over 43 percent this year. The ETF closed around $20.50 on January 2 and is currently trading around $12.50. If Soros still holds 2 million shares, he is staring at a loss of $16 million just this year on that one position. To be fair, there is a reasonable chance the aforementioned hedge fund legends, and perhaps some of their colleagues, have been trimming or outright liquidating positions in the miners and ETFs such as GDX. That would explain some of the intense selling pressure in the ETF over the past week. Two things are certain. First, the next 13F filing season is going to be interesting, particularly when it comes to gold mining stocks. Second, investors that have been paying hedge fund managers an upfront fee and a percentage of profits to be involved with bum trades such as GDX are not likely to be pleased, particularly when they realize they could have just bought the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) on their own and generated superior returns relative to the miner's trade.

2013-05-07,Ominous Options Activity in Gold Miners ETF,"Shares of the downtrodden Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) are down 3.4 percent Tuesday, extending the ETF's 90-day loss to 33.6 percent, and some traders are betting things could get worse for GDX. Citing a note from Interactive Brokers, Barron's reports nearly 40,000 June $27 puts on GDX have changed hands today compared to open interest of 16,819 contracts. It looks like the bulk of the volume was purchased for an average premium of $0.89 per contract. Put buyers stand ready to profit at June expiration should the price of the underlying plunge 9.5%, according to the Interactive Brokers note. The note appeared in the Barron's Focus on Funds column in today's online edition. GDX was a holding at the end of the fourth quarter for hedge fund luminaries including David Einhorn and George Soros. That has not prevented the ETF from performing noticeably worse than gold itself. The last time GDX outperformed the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), which is backed by physical gold, on a yearly basis was 2010. In the past year while GLD is down 11.5 percent, GDX has plunged 34.2 percent. Options traders do not appear too enthused by the prospects for the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), either. Volume in the GDXJ June $12 puts is 720 contracts today compared to open interest of 867 contracts, according to Options Monster data. That ETF has lost almost 45 percent in the past year.

2013-05-15,"Market Wrap for Wednesday, May 15: Bull Market Continues as Dow and S&P Hit New Highs","A late day push helped the U.S. stock market to another strong close on Wednesday. The Dow and S&P 500 finished the session at new all-time highs and all of the major averages recorded steady gains. U.S. stocks have been on fire at the beginning of 2013 and the current investing landscape shows few signs of a correction on the horizon. Investors are showing considerable confidence in the markets and new cash has been pouring into riskier assets on a near-daily basis. Major Averages The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 60 points, or 0.40 percent, to 15,276. The S&P 500 climbed better than 8 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,659. The Nasdaq Composite rose 9 points, or 0.26 percent, to just below 3,472. PPI Producer prices fell for the second consecutive month, falling 0.7 percent in April compared to a decline of 0.6 percent in March. This was more than the consensus estimate calling for a decline of 0.5 percent. On a core basis, which excludes food and energy, PPI was up 0.1 percent for April and in line with the consensus. That came in slightly below the 0.2 percent gain for March. Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization Industrial production declined 0.5 percent in April after rising 0.3 percent for the month of March. The consensus expected industrial production to fall 0.2 percent. Capacity utilization was 77.8 percent in April versus 78.3 percent in March. This was the lowest level of capacity utilization since January. Economists expected the figures to remain unchanged at 78.3 percent. Manufacturing capacity utilization came in at 75.9 percent. Commodities Crude oil prices were mixed on Wednesday. Nearing the closing bell for equities, NYMEX crude futures were essentially unchanged at $94.20. Brent contracts were last up more than 1 percent to $103.70. Precious metals plunged on the day. In late afternoon trade, COMEX gold futures were down 2.22 percent to $1,392.90 while silver had lost 3.67 percent to $22.52. Copper futures were last trading down 0.62 percent. The grain complex was mostly lower on Wednesday. Corn futures had lost 0.27 percent and wheat was last trading down 2.39 percent. In soft commodities, coffee prices fell 2.40 percent and all products were trading lower. Bonds Bonds bounced back from recent losses on Wednesday. Heading into the closing bell, the iShares Barclays 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSE: TLT) was up 0.52 percent to $117.17. Yields fell on the day as prices rose. The 2-Year Note yield lost one basis point to 0.24 percent while the 5-Year yield fell three basis points to 0.83 percent. Both the 10-Year Note yield and the yield on the 30-Year Bond lost three basis points to 1.94 percent and 3.16 percent, respectively. Currencies The U.S. dollar was up moderately on the session. Late in the day, the PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish ETF (NYSE: UUP), which tracks the performance of the greenback versus a basket of foreign currencies, had gained 0.29 percent to $22.80. The closely watched EUR/USD pair was last trading down 0.46 percent to $1.2876. No other currency pairs moved more than 0.10 percent on the day. Volatility and Volume Despite a strong day for stocks, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) had registered a slight gain late on Wednesday. The VIX was last up 0.47 percent to 12.83, but remains at very low levels. Volume was lighter than usual on the day despite the ongoing bull market. Only around 101 million SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) shares traded hands compared to a 3-month daily average of 127 million. Stock Movers Shares of Comstock Holdings (NASDAQ: CHCI) were trading up more than 31 percent late in the day after the company's fiscal first-quarter earnings results. Small-cap name YRC Worldwide (NASDAQ: YRCW) climbed more than 21 percent on Wednesday on a technical breakout. SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR) was last trading up around 9 percent after the solar company provided Q2 guidance well above consensus estimates. The company's fiscal 2013 forecast was in line with expectations. Himax Technologies (NASDAQ: HIMX) had climbed around 12 percent in afternoon trade. The stock has been rallying sharply in recent weeks and a bullish Seeking Alpha article may have been responsible for Wednesday's move. Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) added more than 5 percent on Wednesday. The company is set to release abstracts at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting at 6 p.m. Computer Sciences (NYSE: CSC) lost almost 10 percent after the company missed fourth-quarter revenue estimates. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) shed more than 3 percent after a research firm said that the company's share of the smartphone market fell in the first-quarter. Questcor Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: QCOR) lost more than 9 percent on the day. The stock had risen sharply on Tuesday, and some of the losses may have been attributable to profit taking. First Majestic Silver (NYSE: AG) lost almost 9 percent in the wake of a rout in silver prices. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) fell almost 8 percent as gold prices slumped on Wednesday."
2013-05-17,"4 Things Einhorn, Soros Are Forgetting About Gold Miners ETF","Highlighting fourth-quarter 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was noted hedge fund legends David Einhorn and George Soros held sizable stakes in the largest gold miners ETF, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). To be fair to Soros, during the fourth quarter, he pared his stakes in GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) by 800,000 and 400,000 shares, but he still owned 1.5 million shares of GDX and about two million shares of GDXJ at the end of the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, Soros held 2.66 million shares of GDX, according to the latest 13F, meaning his stake in the ETF almost doubled. The filing also shows Soros still holds 1.2 million shares of GDXJ and initiated a new options position in that ETF. As for Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, that hedge fund still owns over 6 million shares of GDX. Either Einhorn and Soros know something about GDX and GDXJ that most of the rest of the world does not or they are forgetting the following. Average Returns Or shall we say disma? Ninety days ago, GDX was a $40 ETF. It will be lucky to close above $28 this week. Ninety days ago, GDXJ was a $17 ETF. It will be lucky to close above $11 this week. In other words, the average return for the two ETFs in the past three months is a loss of about 33 percent. Ominous Options Activity Earlier this month, it was reported that options traders were stepping into the June GDX $27 puts in a big way. Problem is that put buying was not a one-off event. Put buyers have again been targeting GDX in recent days. Bad At The Top Three stocks – Goldcorp (NYSE: GG), Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) – combine for over 29 percent of GDX's weight. Goldcorp is down 28.3 percent year-to-date. Barrick has plunged almost 46 percent. Einhorn owns 1.96 million shares of Barrick, by the way. Newmont has tumbled 33 percent. Dividend Cuts In April, Newmont slashed its dividend by 17.6 percent. Deutsche Bank said Barrick and Kinross Gold (NYSE: KGC), which accounts for 4.5 percent of GDX's weight, could also be dividend cutters. Further, as expectations for near-term operating cash flows fall, we may see gold miners defer or shelve expansion projects in order to preserve free cash flows.

2013-05-17,"Four Things Einhorn, Soros Are Forgetting About Gold Miners ETF","Highlighting fourth-quarter 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was noted hedge fund legends David Einhorn and George Soros held sizable stakes in the largest gold miners ETF, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). To be fair to Soros, during the fourth quarter, he pared his stakes in GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) by 800,000 and 400,000 shares, but he still owned 1.5 million shares of GDX and about two million shares of GDXJ at the end of the quarter. At the end of the first quarter, Soros held 2.66 million shares of GDX, according to the latest 13F, meaning his stake in the ETF almost doubled. The filing also shows Soros still holds 1.2 million shares of GDXJ and initiated a new options position in that ETF. As for Einhorn's Greenlight Capital, that hedge fund still owns over 6 million shares of GDX. Either Einhorn and Soros know something about GDX and GDXJ that most of the rest of the world does not or they are forgetting the following. Average Returns Or shall we say disma? Ninety days ago, GDX was a $40 ETF. It will be lucky to close above $28 this week. Ninety days ago, GDXJ was a $17 ETF. It will be lucky to close above $11 this week. In other words, the average return for the two ETFs in the past three months is a loss of about 33 percent. Ominous Options Activity Earlier this month, it was reported that options traders were stepping into the June GDX $27 puts in a big way. Problem is that put buying was not a one-off event. Put buyers have again been targeting GDX in recent days. Bad At The Top Three stocks – Goldcorp (NYSE: GG), Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) – combine for over 29 percent of GDX's weight. Goldcorp is down 28.3 percent year-to-date. Barrick has plunged almost 46 percent. Einhorn owns 1.96 million shares of Barrick, by the way. Newmont has tumbled 33 percent. Dividend Cuts In April, Newmont slashed its dividend by 17.6 percent. Deutsche Bank said Barrick and Kinross Gold (NYSE: KGC), which accounts for 4.5 percent of GDX's weight, could also be dividend cutters. Further, as expectations for near-term operating cash flows fall, we may see gold miners defer or shelve expansion projects in order to preserve free cash flows. Dividend cuts may also be on the horizon, as dividend payouts had been ratcheted up aggressively as gold prices climbed, according to Morningstar. That does not bode well for long-term holders of GDX, which it can be said Soros and Einhorn have already been. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-07-15,The Tape Says Take Profits And Run When Mining ETF Bounces,"Some stocks, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) being a prime example, develop cult followings. Sometimes that is a good thing, but often times it is not. After all, members of a cult have, to put things delicately, given away their freedom of thought. Some ETFs accrue cult followings over time, too. Gold mining ETFs, such as the group's largest fund, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), have some impassioned shareholders. Confirming that is as simple as heading over to Twitter where, last week, a certain ETF analyst was on the receiving end of some choice words from gold mining bulls after those stocks spiked when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke implied quantitative easing tapering may not be as imminent as some previously thought. In this space, we've been bearish on gold mining ETFs for some time. One can timestamp that bearishness back to at least May 2012, when we wondered what happens to ETFs that slump back to their debut prices. Funds highlighted in that story include GDX and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), a fund that was recently reverse split. RELATED: Four Things Einhorn, Soros Are Forgetting About Gold Miners ETF Since then, we have wondered aloud if things can actually get worse for mining ETFs. Then we proved that even really, really smart guys like David Einhorn, John Paulson and George Soros have struggled with mining stocks and ETFs. Overall, we have offered up plenty of analysis and coverage of what has generally been an awful time to hold mining ETFs for any more than a few days here and there. In the U.S., everyone is entitled to free speech, including giving other folks a hard time on Twitter. No problem at all, but here is a fact: GDX is down almost 43 percent since our piece questioning the validity of being long GDX and GDXJ was published on May 11, 2012. More importantly, this piece is not about being right. It is about what happens after GDX notches a good day or a few good days. Since those instants have been rare over the past year, the sample set is easy to establish. From September 12-14, 2012, GDX gained 7.6 percent. By October 15, the fund had lost 4.1 percent. Not too bad for an ETF this volatile, but there are other examples of GDX not being able to hold a few days of gains. From November 5-8, 2012, GDX gained about $2 to close at $51.41 on November 8. On November 15, the ETF closed below $46. From February 20-27, 2013 GDX traded modestly higher from $37.45 to $39.05. By April 17, the ETF had plunged to just over $27. May 17 through June 3 was a nice time to own GDX as the ETF went from $26.38 to $30.36. Holding the fund through June 22 was not wise as it dropped nearly 27 percent. However, by June 28, GDX was back to almost $24.50. By July 8, the ETF closed at $22.90. Bottom line: There very well could come time that gold miners rally and rally big-time. However, the tape proves that being long GDX and rival funds over the past 12-16 months has been difficult to say the least. Indeed, these ETFs have made for some good TRADES, but terrible long-term holds. Translation: If you catch five, six or seven percent in GDX or a comparable ETF in just a few days, do not wait and take something off the table. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-07-23,Put a RING on it With This ETF,"You might have heard that the good times for gold are back. At least temporarily. Bullion enjoyed its best intraday performance in over a year Monday, a move that was strong enough to put the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) within pennies of its 50-day moving average, something GLD has not traded above since early this year. Embattled gold miners are getting in on the act. Or maybe, for once, they are leading the way. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) now resides somewhat comfortably above its 50-day line. In the past month while GLD is up four percent, GDX gained 15.5 percent heading into the startof trading Tuesday. All that after gold miners had been maligned and at least five gold mining ETFs, including the popular Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT), were reverse split earlier this year. Should this rally gold miners rally be sustainable, investors may want to consider an ETF with RING). RING debuted at the end of January 2012 and is a direct competitor to GDX, the king of gold mining ETFs. The two have plenty similarities and that is nice way of saying that, until the past few weeks, both have been destroyers of capital as both down more than 40 percent year-to-date. Investors that bank on GDX are, whether they know it or not, are banking on Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Barrick (NYSE: ABX) as those stocks combine for 25 percent of that fund's weight. With RING, that number rises to 28 percent. A key difference between the two ETFs, in addition to the fact that RING has nine more holdings at 39 than GDX's 30, is that the latter offers some decent exposure to silver miners. Silver Wheaton (NYSE: SLW) is a top-10 holding in GDX while Cia de Minas Buenaventura (NYSE: BVN) receives a weight of 3.7 percent. Pan American Silver (NASDAQ: PAAS) is 2.2 percent of GDX's weight. Buenaventura is a RING holding, too, but overall that ETF is light on pure-play silver miners. In theory, the difference in silver miners allocations should make a noticeable difference in terms of performance between GDX and RING. Although silver miners have joined in on the precious metals mining resurgence with the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) surging 20 percent in the past month, that has not lead to a significant performance gap between GDX and RING. The edge goes to GDX, but the result is a gain of 15.54 percent to 15.45 percent for RING. Both funds are inexpensive on valuation with GDX sporting a price-to-book ratio of 0.95 at the end of June while RING's was 0.89. Deciding between the two is actually not difficult. GDX's average daily volume of over 26.1 million shares means it is the superior bet for active traders, but RING's 0.39 percent expense ratio (13 basis points cheaper than GDX's) indicates the fund is a credible option for those daring enough to make long-term bets on gold miners.

2013-07-24,"If Mining Rally is Legitimate, Don't Forget These ETFs","Traders appear to be taking some profits in gold miners and the corresponding ETFs Wednesday and that is not surprising. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and its small-cap counterpart, the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are both down 3.2 percent. That might sound bad, but consider that since the start of July GDX was up almost 14 percent heading into Wednesday and GDXJ was up 19.6 percent. Some profit-taking was due to occur at some point. While the recent upside moves by various mining ETFs have been impressive, the track record for these funds and their constituents over the past 18 to 24 months has been ominous at best. That could mean some investors might need some more cajoling to truly embrace mining stocks and ETFs. Compelling valuations and the potential for a sustained rally in gold and silver prices are fundamental factors that could bode well for further upside for the miners. If that scenario comes to fruition, some obscure ETFs may be also be worthy of consideration. PureFunds ISE Junior Silver ETF (NYSE: SILJ) When it comes to silver mining ETFs, the Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) is the dominant name, though that fund has a rival in the form of the iShares MSCI Global Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SLVP). Over the past month, either SIL or SLVP made for a great choice as the two are up an average of about 23 percent. No one would quibble over returns like that, but the PureFunds ISE Junior Silver ETF has surged 27 percent over that time. Think of SILJ as the GDXJ of silver mining ETFs. Yes, there are some small-caps in SIL and SLVP, but the newly minted SILJ is the first pure-play ETF to exclusively hold silver explorers and junior silver producers, according to PureFunds. Silvercorp (NYSE: SVM) and Fortuna Silver (NYSE: FSM), SILJ's two largest holdings, have an average market cap of about $500 million. Those stocks combine for over 24 percent of the ETF's weight. IndexIQ Australia Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: KROO) Slowing economic growth in China, the looming end of the Australian mining boom and, yes, falling gold prices have been among the reasons Australia ETFs have disappointed this year. Now that gold prices are rebounding, so are Australia ETFs. The iShares MSCI Australia ETF (NYSE: EWA) is up 5.4 percent in the past month, but the better of playing Australia's status as one of the world's largest gold producers is with the IndexIQ Australia Small-Cap ETF. KROO has proven as much with a one-month gain of 12 percent. KROO has 22.8 percent weight to the materials sector, which is 450 basis points higher than EWA's exposure to the same sector. The small-cap fund also gives investors exposure to improvement in Australian economic data as consumer discretionary names account for over 26 percent of the fund's weight. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG) The Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF, a recent victim of a reverse split, has fought back to surge 22 percent in the past month. That is one of the best one-month run among mining ETFs, though hardly anyone has noticed because of GGGG's size (just $3.6 million in assets under management). On the surface, GGGG appears to be a copycat of GDX and the funds do share a few of the same holdings. However, GGGG is not heavily allocated to mining giants such as Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Barrick (NYSE: ABX) as GDX is. In fact, those stocks are not even found among GGGG's 23 holdings. The Global X offering has a heavy international bias as the U.S. receives a weight of just under five percent, the same as Kazakhstan. Canada, Australia and South Africa combine for about 70 percent of the ETF's country weight. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-07-24,These ETFs Are Beating The Reverse Split Curse,"Though more apt to happen with leveraged funds, reverse splits are a fact of life in the world of ETFs. Proving that traditional long ETFs have be subject to reverse splits, since the start of May, six Global X funds and seven Market Vectors products have been reverse split. It is not a stretch to say that, at least officially, no ETF sponsor is going to acknowledge the reverse split curse. Then again, superstitious football players are reluctant to talk about the the Madden video game cover curse. A curse may just be in one's imagination, but the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (NYSE: VXX) has undergone multiple reverse splits over the years, but its chart still looks like this. However, some ETFs that have previously traveled down Reverse Split Boulevard have recently been stellar performers. Consider the following. Alternative Energy Specifically, solar ETFs. The Guggenheim Solar ETF (NYSE: TAN) and the Market Vectors Solar Energy ETF (NYSE: KWT) were both reverse split in 2012, also known as the dark days for solar stocks. This year has brought a stunning reversal of fortune for solar ETFs as TAN and KWT are the two best-performing non-leveraged ETFs. However, there is a big gap between the two, 2,7000 basis points in favor of TAN because TAN features a larger weight to First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), among other reasons. TAN also includes Elon Musk's Solar City (NASDAQ: SCTY) among its lineup. KWT does not. The Market Vectors Global Alternative Energy ETF (NYSE: GEX) was recently reverse split, though this was somewhat strange since the ETF was performing well and trading in the double-digits. In fact, GEX is the third-best non-leveraged ETF this year behind TAN and KWT. GEX has an 11.4 percent weight to some company called Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) and that is probably helping the ETF surge this year. Gold Miners The recent list of ETFs to be reverse split since the start of May includes four gold miners funds. That group includes the popular Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). It is no secret that gold miners have bounced in a big way in recent weeks. Even when including today's 3.5 percent loss, GDX is up more than 21 percent since July 2, the day after its reverse split went into effect. Three of the Global X ETFs that were recently reverse split were GLDX), the Global X Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: JUNR) and the Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GGGG). In the past month, that trio is up an average of 25.4 percent. The Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) was reverse split on April 2 and its total performance since then is dreadful, but holding leveraged ETFs for four months at a time is a no-no. Four weeks is a different story and over the past four weeks, NUGT was up 54 percent heading into the start of trading Wednesday. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-09-04,Big Gold Miners ETF To Stick With Current Index,"Following some previously announced changes to its underlying index, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) will continue tracking the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index. Last month, it was revealed that the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index would begin including more American depositary receipts and global depositary receipts while barring companies with market values below $750 million. Related: If Mining Rally Is Legitimate, Don't Forget These ETFs. The NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index is a modified market capitalization-weighted index, and provides exposure to publicly traded companies worldwide involved primarily in gold mining, representing a diversified blend of small-, mid- and large- capitalization stocks, according to the GDX web page. GDX is the largest gold miners ETF with $6.4 billion in assets under management. Goldcorp (NYSE: GG), Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) are the ETF's top-three holdings and combine for about 35 percent of the fund's weight. Changes to the index are expected to take place after September 20. After reviewing the improved methodology, we are pleased with the planned changes and expect them to be beneficial for investors, said Brandon Rakszawski, product manager with Market Vectors, in a statement. By moving to allow for the inclusion of non-U.S. listed companies, we believe the Index will better capture the global nature of the gold mining industry. Additionally, by increasing the minimum market cap for inclusion in the Index, the overall liquidity of GDX holdings may be improved . Market Vectors also issues the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). GDXJ, which has $1.8 billion in AUM, is benchmarked to an in-house index. For more on ETFs, click here.

2013-11-26,"Where is the Bottom for Gold Miners? (GDX, GDXJ, DUST, JDST)","After a decade of gains for the gold, the precious metal is setting up for its second consecutive negative year. The SPDR Gold ETF (NYSE: GLD) is down 26 percent year to date and yesterday traded at the lowest level since July. While the losses for GLD look bad considering the gains in equities, the gold mining stocks are taking an even bigger beating. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is hitting a new five-year low and is now down 53 percent in 2013. The looming question evolves around where the bottom is for the mining stocks. Related: Gold Ends Week Below $1,300 as it searches for a Bottom The sector has been attempting to cut costs as the price of gold has fallen to levels that are troubling for the miners. According to Goldman Sachs, most miners can deal with $1,300/ounce gold prices, but any further drops would lead to mine closures and other means of cutting costs. With gold currently trading near $1,245/ounce it is putting pressure on the miners to either make drastic cost cutting measures or lose money on some of their mines. The smaller gold mining companies, referred to as the juniors, are in an even more precarious situation. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is down 60 percent this year and trading at a new low. Inverse Gold Miner ETFs There are a few ETFs that move in the inverse direction of the gold miners and they have been big winners the last few months. The most heavily traded of the group is the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3x ETN (NYSE: DUST). The ETN will move three times the inverse of the underlying index on a daily basis. In the last month the ETN is up 69 percent. For the year DUST has a gain of 186 percent. A new ETN in the mix is the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bear 3x ETN (NYSE: JDST). In the last month the ETN is up 105 percent and is trading at a new high. Related: 3 Reasons Family Offices Should Invest in Gold The unfortunately problem with the two inverse ETNs is that they are highly leveraged (three times) products. Due to its daily reset and the high leverage they make for extremely aggressive investment vehicles and they are not appropriate for most investors. Short-term, educated traders should only use the ETNs because as quickly as they go up, then can fall just as fast and the losses can become significant. In an ideal world there would be a vehicle that would offer an inverse option for the gold miners that did not involve leverage. There is no such product available at this time for traders. Therefore, the best strategy is to stay far away from the gold miners until the free fall is over and the landscape has changed for the sector."

2014-03-12,Apparently This Bull Is Still Kicking,"For about an hour on Monday morning, it felt like the #growthslowing theme was back. Germany was tanking. Shanghai had been creamed. And at 9:45 am the bears launched an attack on the S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). Bam, the low for the day was gone. And five minutes later, Friday's intraday low had been taken out. In short, the bears were feeling it and the bulls appeared to be on the run. At issue was the fact that China's export numbers had stunk up the joint. Instead of a 7.5 percent increase over year-ago levels, the totals for February wound up falling 18.1 percent. China's Shanghai Composite dove 2.86 percent in response, and the CSI 300 Index (NASDAQ: ASHR) dropped to its lowest level in five years. Ouch. Related: How The Crisis Play Book Can Benefit Your Portfolio European bourses were also not happy places to be early on Monday, because the continent's economic fate is closely tied to China's growth. And with Europe's economy just starting to find its long-lost mojo, #growthslowing in China would NOT be good news for investors in the eurozone. Blame It On The... But as has been the case lately, traders quickly got over the data -- as they simply blamed it on the weather. Oops, that's the wrong excuse - my bad. Here we go... Regarding the China data, it was talk of distortions from China's Lunar New Year holiday -- and what was referred to as heavy over-invoicing in the year-ago period -- that was blamed for the overly weak data. Whether or not the headline-reading algos were trained to buy when seeing the words heavy and over-invoicing in the same sentence remains to be seen. But just about the time things started looking ugly at the corner of Broad and Wall, the buy algos started running. Geopolitical Tensions The bears also appeared to have the geopolitical tensions in Ukraine/Crimea/Russia on their side. There had been no improvement over the weekend, after Moscow signaled it was prepared to annex Ukraine. The latest press reports were focused on further Russian incursions, as Russian forces were said to control 11 border guard posts across Crimea. This whole annexation thing hasn't been sitting well with the West. President Obama took to the microphones on Friday and Secretary of State Kerry was busy setting up meetings in the Kremlin. Then on Sunday, Germany's Angela Merkel told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the Moscow-backed referendum in Crimea was illegal and violated Ukraine's constitution. So, anyone paying attention to the goings-on in Russia, Ukraine and Crimea couldn't be blamed for being a bit fidgety on Monday. It appears Mr. Putin is intent on doing whatever he pleases, regardless of the verbiage coming from points west. However, traders refused to bite on this mess again on Monday. Perhaps crisis-fatigue can be blamed, as just about everyone in the game has probably had their fill of crises by now. But it was interesting to note the algos weren't able to ignite anything to the downside on Tuesday. A Boeing 777 Goes Missing Then there was talk of terrorism -- in response to reports that a Malaysian jetliner with 239 people on board had gone missing without a trace. The facts that (a) there was no distress signal from the pilots and (b) the weather was clear left many scratching their heads and wondering about foul play. But again, the bears weren't able to capitalize. Sure, the Dow (NYSE: DIA) finished down 34 points. And yes, there were some moves in things like the industrial metals that weren't pretty. For example, iron ore and copper names were hit hard, as Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF) fell 3.8 percent, Southern Copper Corp (NASDAQ: SCCO) was off 3.5 percent and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (NYSE: FCX) gave up 2.5 percent. Global mining plays also lagged, as the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NASDAQ: GDXJ) dropped 2.6 percent. Bottom Line: Bears Go Home Empty-Handed While the market's focus can and often does shift in the blink of an eye, it appears the bears missed yet another opportunity earlier in the week. They had arguments for #growthslowing, geopolitical tensions and the word terrorism flashing on television screens. And yet our furry friends went home largely empty-handed. As the saying kinda goes, a market that can't go down on bad news isn't in trouble. So while stocks are overbought, the bull is getting old, the sentiment indicators are trying hard to get people's attention and a pullback to test the latest breakout would certainly be logical in here somewhere, it appears that this bull isn't quite dead yet."

2014-05-27,"Gold ETFs On The Verge Of A Major Breakdown (GLD, GDX, GDXJ)","The price of gold is falling once again Tuesday, down one percent in early trading to the lowest level since February. Leading Tuesday’s sell-off are the numbers out of China regarding the precious metal. Chinese net imports of gold from Hong Kong fell to 67 tons in April, much lower than the 85 tons in March. This is the lowest monthly number since February 2013. Analysts believe that Chinese banks are already sitting on large amounts of gold after going on a buying spree in 2013. According to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in the week ending May 20, hedge funds and money managers cut their bullish bets in gold and went as far to establish short positions in silver. Related: Catching Up With The BRIC ETFs (BKF, BIK, EEB) In the past, gold has been viewed as a hedge against geopolitical tension, slow economic environments and a falling U.S. dollar. The tensions around the world have been fairly high, the world economy is growing moderately and the U.S. is not far from a multi-year low. Yet, gold has struggled to move higher. On a technical basis, the SPDR Gold ETF (NYSE: GLD) is on pace to finish Tuesday at the worst close since early February. This breakdown would have the ETF completing a descending triangle pattern that is highly negative. The pattern includes a series of lower highs (dating back to March) and a flat support level ($123.50 area). A close below support is a sell signal and could send GLD back down to the $115 area. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has been forming a similar pattern and is now well below its support level of $23.25. If the pattern continues, it could send GDX down another 10 percent to test the lows of late 2013. Not to miss out on the bearish party is the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), which is down nearly three percent on Tuesday and is trading at the lowest level since January. Considering gold has not been able to rally in the face of geopolitical uncertainty and a falling U.S. dollar over the last couple of years, the current technical breakdown does not bode well for the yellow metal. Investors need to take a good long look at the charts before considering an investment in gold ETFs."

2014-05-27,Gold and Gold Miners Give Up 2014 Gains,"Gold is melting down Tuesday and bringing miners down with it. A key catalyst driving down the price in gold is the successful presidential election in Ukraine. Presidential elections held on Sunday were widely opposed by pro-Russian reporters, leaving the investing community concerned that intense fighting in the country would increase instability. Although pro-Russian supporters blocked some from voting, the elections were widely regarded as successful and Vladimir Putin recognized the vote. Because this success is seen as taking risk out of the region, investors are able to transfer funds from gold to equities while maintaining a similar risk level in their portfolio. In addition, the value of the Ruble is up 0.62 percent Tuesday versus the dollar, indicating that Russian entities and traders are selling gold for Rubles. The opposite was seen at the outbreak of the conflict. Gold is often used as a hedge against inflation and equity downturns. The USDX is up more than half a percent over the past five trading sessions and major indexes are trading near all time highs, reducing the appeal of the commodity. Related: Best Stocks Under $5 Right Now Gold futures were last trading down more than two percent to $1,266.10; this is the lowest gold contracts have traded since the beginning of February. Although significantly down from their $1,392.6 2014 high, contracts are still up 5.7 percent since opening the year. Gold miners, who typically move in tandem to the price of gold are down 3.69 percent according to the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX). This is the lowest miners have been trading at since the middle January after peaking at a 31.24 percent gain earlier this year. Junior gold miners, who are more sensitive to a move in gold price because they are less able to weather a turndown in price, are down more than five percent Tuesday. Miners have been working at lowering their cost to mine an ounce after 2013’s turndown in price, with larger operators generally having more success. Despite the announcement of cost reductions in the first part of 2014, miners are currently trading at a very small premium to the movement in gold price."

The growth is not expected to slow anytime soon as the government continues to quell violence and looks to expand the nation's infrastructure system. The ETF has broken out recently, gaining 3.4 percent over the last week. The ETF is now sitting at the best level since last November. The next level of resistance will be in the $23-$24 area. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) A 4.5 percent rally Tuesday has the ETF back above its 50-day moving average for the first time since March. The rally also broke the ETF out of a narrow downtrend it had been trading in since March. Related Link: Brazil ETFs Rally Into World Cup (EWZ, BRXX, BRAF) The key for the breakout to continue is for GDXJ to remain above the $35.50 area for a few days. That would confirm that a more significant up trend is forming. If the breakout does not hold, the odds of the ETF continuing its downtrend increase dramatically. Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ: SOCL) The market was flat Tuesday, however the “high flying” technology stocks were able to continue the rally. After taking a massive beating earlier this year, the niche technology stocks are in the midst of a comeback. SOCL was up 1.04 percent Tuesday to close at the best level in six weeks and extend its winning streak to five sessions. It appears the selling in the social media sector was overdone and investors are realizing the long-term growth potential. Sprott Physical Platinum and Palladium Fund (NYSE: SPPP) The basket of platinum and palladium has been outperforming all other metals this year and over the last 12 months. Tuesday, the ETF closed up 1.5 percent to a new 52-week high. As gold has struggled with a multi-year down trend SPPP has been moving in the opposite direction. The reason behind the move has been the action in palladium the last six months. The ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) is hitting a new all-time high and is up 20 percent in 2014. Platinum has been holding its own versus gold, but lagging palladium."

2014-06-11,"ETF Outlook for the Wednesday June 11, 2014 (GXG, GDXJ, SOCL, SPPP)","ETF Outlook for the Wednesday June 11, 2014 Global X InterBolsa FTSE Colombia 20 ETF (NYSE: GXG) The fourth largest country in Latin America checked in with solid growth of 4.3 percent in 2013. And the growth is not expected to slow anytime soon as the government continues to quell violence and they look to expand their infrastructure system. The ETF has broken out recently with a gin of 3.4 percent over the last week as the ETF is now sitting at the best level since last November. The next level of resistance will be in the $23-$24 area. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) A 4.5 percent rally yesterday has the ETF back above its 50-day moving average for the first time since March. The rally also broke the ETF out of a narrow downtrend it had been trading in since March as well. The key for the breakout to continue for GDXJ is to remain above the $35.50 area for a few days. This would be confirmation that a more significant up trend is forming. If the breakout does not hold the odds of the ETF continuing its downtrend increase dramatically. Global X Social Media ETF (NYSE: SOCL) The market was flat yesterday, however the “high flying” technology stocks were able to continue the rally. After taking a massive beating earlier this year the niche technology stocks are in the midst of a comeback. SOCL was up 1.04 percent yesterday to close at the best level in six weeks and extend its winning streak to five sessions. It appears the selling in the social media sector was overdone and investors are realizing the long-term growth potential as money flows back into the sector.

GDXJ is a basket of junior gold miners that typically have a smaller market capitalization and often are considered risky investments. The ETF was up 4.6 percent yesterday and it closed at the best level since March. Adding to the bullish chart is an increase in volume that indicates the buyers are in control. The next significant resistance level is the $46 area.

Related Link: Brazil ETFs Rally Into The World Cup The iShares MSCI Brazil Index ETF (NYSE: EWZ) finished yesterday at the best closing level of the year after gaining 2.15 percent. However, BRXX outshined EWZ with a gain of 3.6 percent as it also closed at the best level of 2014. Both ETFs are in the midst of breakouts--after lagging their peers for most of the year, they are now the leaders. Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX) The Russian ETF has now proven that it is in the midst of a new bull market. A bull market is when an ETF is up at least 20 percent from a low. Since the low in March, RSX is up 27 percent and yesterday it closed at the best level since January. On a valuation basis, Russia remains attractive as a long-term investment. That being said, the country is not completely out of the woods with the Ukraine situation. SPDR Utilities ETF (NYSE: XLU) The best performing of the major sectors yesterday was the “boring” utilities. XLU finished the day up 2.3 percent at the best level in over six years. The move back into the lower volatility sector has been led by the thinking that interest rates will remain low after the FOMC statement yesterday and that utilities pay above-average income to investors. When it comes to finding income in this market it is difficult and investors are looking at all possible vehicles, including utilities."

2014-06-19,3 Gold & Silver Mining ETFs Rocketing Higher In June,"Precious metals and mining stocks have been mired in a pernicious slump that has failed to exhibit any encouraging signs of late. While the attention has all been focused on the Federal Reserve and new highs in the broader market, several gold and silver ETFs have been making a stealth move higher in June as well. The MarketVectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) represents 40 publicly traded companies around the world that are engaged in the exploration, mining, and refinement of gold bullion. This ETF currently has more than $7.7 billion dedicated to a blend of market-cap styles as a representative benchmark for the industry. GDX has been on a roller coaster ride during the first half of 2014. After getting off to a strong start, this ETF has been on a decline that returned its price to the flat line for the year. Related Link: Semiconductor ETFs Are This Year's Technology Titans However, a renewed surge in gold prices has thrust these stocks back into the spotlight. Since the beginning of June, GDX has jumped over 15 percent and could retest its prior March high if conditions remain favorable for this momentum to continue. In addition, the small company focused MarketVectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) has leapt more than 25 percent this month. This impressive strength shows just so fast markets can turn when sentiment and public opinion is working against a particular sector like gold that is closely watched. Whether or not this is a short-term relief rally as a respite from selling pressure or the start of a new uptrend remains to be seen. However, gold miners aren’t the only precious metals companies leading a turn around this month. The Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) has also jumped more than 22 percent as silver bullion prices have recovered back above their 200-day moving average. This ETF is laser-focused on just 26 companies engaged in the silver mining industry. If precious metals prices continue to rally, it could spark additional interest in more aggressive mining stocks that would reignite a fire under this beaten down asset class."
2014-09-05,Best And Worst ETFs Of The Week Amid ECB Easing Measures,"The markets managed to put forth another relatively flat week considering the deluge of headlines that prompted several intra-day price swings in the major indices. One of the much anticipated news events of the week included further cuts from the European Central Bank across its three main interest rates, as well as an announcement of further stimulus ahead. This prompted a rally in European stocks and subsequent dive in the euro currency. The following ETFs represent a sample of the best and worst performing funds over the last five trading sessions. Related Link: 2 Aerospace And Defense ETFs Hoping To Take Flight BEST: China A-Shares And Cattle The breakout in Chinese stocks this week coincided with additional positive economic data that indicated better than expected growth in the services sector. That prompted a 6.5 percent jump in the Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 500 China A-Shares Small Cap ETF (NYSE: ASHS). This ETF tracks 500 small company A-share listings in mainland China and has been off to a fast-paced start since its introduction in May of this year. Another unrelated sector that saw a similar increase of 6.3 percent this week is the iPath Dow Jones UBS Livestock Total Return Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: COW). This exchange-traded note is designed to track the price of cattle futures and has been ripping higher since mid-August. COW is one commodity that has been showing excellent relative strength on a short-term basis. WORST: Junior Gold Miners Gold mining stocks experienced a difficult holiday-shortened week as a rising U.S. dollar and falling precious metals prices hurt this sector. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) felt the sting especially hard by falling seven percent over the last five trading sessions. This ETF tracks 62 small- and medium-size companies engaged in gold mining operations around the world. GDXJ currently has $2.4 billion in total assets and charges an expense ratio of 0.57 percent. Despite this recent fall, GDXJ is still sitting on a gain of 24.5 percent this year and may look to turn around its short-term weakness on a rebound in precious metals prices."
2014-11-01,Best And Worst ETFs Of The Week Amid Halloween Highs,"The stock market continued to show tremendous resilience this week as better than expected GDP and strong earnings reports bolstered stocks. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) moved higher on the last day of October, which coincided with a commitment by Japan’s central bank to increase quantitative easing measures in an effort to revive their stagnant economy. On an intra-day basis, SPY retested its September highs and appears poised to extend its winning streak into the final months of the year. The following ETFs represent a sample of the best- and worst-performing funds over the last five trading sessions. BEST: Small-Cap Technology Stocks Small-cap stocks have been overlooked for the majority of the year due to their underperformance versus large-cap peers. However, the October rally has been characterized by a return to risk assets that have favored beaten down sectors for a strong rebound. Related Link: Recent Quantitative ETFs Contend Against Established Favorites The PowerShares S&P Small Cap Information Technology Portfolio (NASDAQ: PSCT) has been the beneficiary of positive earnings and momentum this week that catapulted it to the top of the ETF charts with a gain of more than 7 percent. PSCT tracks 111 small-growth stocks in the technology and electronics sector. Standout companies that helped drive gains in this ETF include Tyler Technologies and Maximus Inc. PSCT has $220 million in total assets and charges an expense ratio of 0.29 percent. WORST: Gold Miners The price of gold bullion fell to new 2014 lows on Friday, which did significant damage to gold mining stocks. The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) fell 18 percent over the last five trading days as lower commodity prices continued to send investors heading for the exits. GDXJ tracks 63 small- and mid-capitalization gold and silver mining companies. These junior miners tend to be more sensitive to industry volatility and as such are experiencing the sharpest drop of the group. The large-cap focused Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) also fell to new year-to-date lows as well. The higher-than-average volume and bearish sentiment for gold stocks may indicate that a capitulation-style event is taking place. However, these stocks have yet to signal that a bottom is in place."

2015-01-21,The SPDR Gold Trust Just Hit A 5-Month High,"The rally in precious metals and related stocks continues to push higher as the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) hits a new five-month high. The initial rally was spurred by oversold technical levels, but the last few weeks the fuel has been moves by central banks around the globe. On Wednesday, Canada was the latest country to surprise the markets with an interest rate move. Next up is the European Central Bank. Even though the moves have hurt the value of the local currencies and helped push the U.S. Dollar Index to multi-year highs, gold has been viewed as an alternative.

2015-07-24,Best And Worst ETFs Of The Week Amid Consumer Discretionary Strength,"After briefly touching a new intra-day high this week, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) fell back below its 50-day moving average and has once again inserted itself into a broad trading range. Investors are likely feeling frustrated this year with the bifurcated nature of the markets that has seen growth sectors soar, while value names collapse. Perhaps the strongest sector this week was the Consumer Discretionary SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLY), which added to gains on the back of strong quarterly results from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX). This all-important gauge of consumer activity is showing no signs of slowing down this year after hitting new highs. The following ETFs represent a sample of the best- and worst-performing funds over the last five trading sessions. BEST: Long Duration Treasury Bonds One of the best performing asset classes this week was long-duration Treasury bonds, as a flight to quality sent interest rates markedly lower. The PIMCO 25 Yr Zro Cupn US Ty Inx Fd ETF (NYSE: ZROZ) gained nearly 4 percent since last Friday’s close. Related Link: Airline ETF Seeks To Overcome Transportation Sector Woes This exchange-traded fund tracks a basket of 20 zero-coupon Treasury bonds with an effective duration of 37.26 years. ZROZ has one of the highest sensitivities to long-term interest rates of any fixed-income ETF, which makes it a preferred method of betting against Treasury yields. This fund currently has $107 million in total assets and charges an expense ratio of 0.15 percent. WORST: Junior Gold Miners The rut in gold prices took its toll on smaller mining companies this week. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) fell over 4 percent, which translated to a 14 percent drop in the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). GDXJ tracks 62 small- and mid-cap gold and silver mining companies. This fund has $1.1 billion in total assets and charges an expense ratio of 0.55 percent. Since the start of the year, GDXJ has dropped over 24 percent to hit new multi-year lows and has yet to show any convincing signs of a bottom in place. Most investors won’t be shocked by the extension of this long-term downtrend and sentiment appears to be firmly seated in the bear camp for the time being. Image Credit: Public Domain"
2015-07-28,This is why Nobody Loves Gold ETFs,"When it comes to commodities and the corresponding exchange traded funds, saying demand for a particular commodity is a big deal is an understatement. And it is demand, or lack thereof, for gold that is hampering ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the world’s largest ETF backed by physical holdings of gold. Not be trite, but these days, bullion demand is anything but golden. Data out Tuesday from industry group GFMS show second-quarter gold demand among retail buyers in China slid 25 percent while jewelry demand slumped 23 percent, Reuters reports. China is the world’s largest gold-consuming country. GLD is trading modestly higher today, but the ETF has slumped 9.1 percent over the past 90 days and on the demand side, there is little relief sight. India, the world’s second-largest gold-consuming country after China, is often pointed to as a potential catalyst to lift gold demand, but that probably won’t be the case this time around if demand does not pick up next month with the start of Indian wedding season. According to the World Gold Council, India imported 891.5 tons of gold last year while demand was 811.1 metric tons. The council believes consumption will increase to between 900 tons and 1,000 tons this year, according to ETF Trends. Investors don’t appear enthusiastic about the idea of waiting around for GLD to bounce. Nearly $976 million was yanked from the ETF during the second quarter and outflows are accelerating in the current quarter. The third quarter isn’t even a month old, but GLD has already bled $1.11 billion in assets. Waning enthusiasm for physical gold is also plaguing shares of gold miners. Over the past three months, four of the 12 worst-performing non-leveraged ETFs are gold or silver miners. That group includes the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the two largest miners ETFs by assets. Although there has been ample chatter regarding the dirt cheap valuations on the miners and the merits of the group as a contrarian play, there is no getting around the fact that the group is well out of favor with investors. Over the past three months, GDX has plunged 33.4% while GDXJ, the junior miners fund, has shed 25.1 percent over the same period. As is the case with GLD, investors appear exasperated with the miners. During the second quarter, investors yanked a combined $256 million from GDX and GDXJ, but those outflows are quickening this quarter as the ETFs have lost a combined $202 million just this month."

And it is demand, or lack thereof, for gold that is hampering ETFs such as the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), the world’s largest ETF backed by physical holdings of gold. It seems these days, bullion demand is anything but golden. Data out Tuesday from industry group GFMS show second-quarter gold demand among retail buyers in China slid 25 percent while jewelry demand slumped 23 percent, Reuters reported. China is the world’s largest gold-consuming country. GLD was trading modestly higher on Tuesday, but the ETF has slumped 9.7 percent over the past 90 days and on the demand side, there is little relief sight. India, the world’s second-largest gold-consuming country after China, is often pointed to as a potential catalyst to lift gold demand, but that probably won’t be the case this time around if demand does not pick up next month with the start of Indian wedding season. Related Link: Brazilian Bungle: Bad News Mounts For Brazil ETFs According to the World Gold Council, India imported 891.5 tons of gold last year while demand was 811.1 metric tons. The council believes consumption will increase to between 900 tons and 1,000 tons this year, according to ETF Trends. Investors don’t appear enthusiastic about the idea of waiting around for GLD to bounce. Nearly $976 million was yanked from the ETF during the second quarter and outflows are accelerating in the current quarter. The third quarter isn’t even a month old, but GLD has already bled $1.11 billion in assets. Waning enthusiasm for physical gold is also plaguing shares of gold miners. Over the past three months, four of the 12 worst-performing non-leveraged ETFs are gold or silver miners. That group includes the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the two largest miners ETFs by assets. Although there has been ample chatter regarding the cheap valuations on the miners and the merits of the group as a contrarian play, there is no getting around the fact that the group is out of favor with investors. Over the past three months, GDX has plunged 33 percent while GDXJ, the junior miners fund, has shed 25.4 percent over the same period. As is the case with GLD, investors appear exasperated with the miners. During the second quarter, investors yanked a combined $256 million from GDX and GDXJ, but those outflows are quickening this quarter as the ETFs have lost a combined $202 million just this month."
2015-08-14,Well Look At That: Gold Miners ETFs Try To Bounce Back,"Gold and the related exchange traded funds have been among this year's most moribund asset classes. Gold miners stocks and ETFs have fared noticeably worse, but despite some modest Friday losses, bullion and miners funds have been solid performers this week. China's move to devalue the yuan is being cited as a primary catalyst behind bullion bullishness this week and for those that are believers in seasonal trends, the start of India's wedding season is fast-approaching. That is an important gold catalyst because the country is the second-largest gold consumer in the world behind China. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the largest gold miners ETF, is up 7.7 percent this week, a move that has brought some much needed relief to the downtrodden miners complex. With GDX rising, its leveraged counterparts are on fire. Heading into Friday's session, the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSE: JNUG) and the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X ETF (NYSE: NUGT) were that issuer's two best triple-leveraged funds on a month-to-date basis with gains of 20.8 percent and 16.3 percent, respectively. JNUG is the triple-leveraged answer to the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). Remember, it was just a week ago that Direxion announced reverse splits of 1-for-10 for NUGT and 1-for-5 for JNUG. ETF reverse splits, in most meaning nearly all instances, do not come about because the fund in question is performing well. That is the case with JNUG and NUGT, which have posted an average year-to-date loss of over 62 percent. That dramatic decline underscores weakness in the mining complex, but as Direxion notes, some big gold miners are taking steps to deal with a turbulent environment for gold. “Randgold Resources, another top holding in the index, has avoided the worst of the turmoil that’s cut into profits for miners and has lowered costs, and raised cash. The best-performing gold miner over the last 10 years, is getting ready for prices to dip well below $1,000.” Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE: ABX) and Randgold Resources Ltd. (NASDAQ: GOLD) are the fourth- and fifth-largest holdings in the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index (GDMNTR), the index tracked by GDX and the index NUGT attempts to deliver triple the daily returns of. The stocks combine for 11.3 percent of that index's weight. For the daring, risk-tolerant gold miners bulls, GDX, NUGT and JNUG could offer some allure at current levels. “The bulls may think that miners are poised to make a new run. In fact, according to Bloomberg, mining stocks are the cheapest relative to gold that they’ve been in 30 years. Some traders may take this as a sign to jump into miners because they’re oversold,” notes Direxion."

Barrick is also conducting $2 billion worth of cuts in spending by 2016,” said Direxion in a new research note. “Randgold Resources, another top holding in the index, has avoided the worst of the turmoil that’s cut into profits for miners and has lowered costs, and raised cash.

2015-12-28,Reason For Optimism In The Junior Gold Miners ETF Chart,"• The Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) is down 87.0 percent in the past five years. • The ETF may have finally bottomed and has not made a new low since July. • The recent breakout above the 50-day SMA is encouraging, but major resistance remains. There’s no question that 2015 was yet another tough year for gold miners, and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF is down another 17.8 percent this year. In the past five years, the GDXJ has lost 87.0 percent of its value while the S&P 500 has surged higher. However, shareholders may finally have reason for optimism headed into 2016. Here’s a look at several reasons why the technicals of the ETF are looking up in the short-term. Finally Finding Support After years of steady declines, the GDXJ finally seems to have found some support at the $18 level. In fact the ETF hasn’t made a new low since July of 2015. The $18 level held during a November re-test, giving shareholders even more reason for optimism. Moving Average Breakout In addition to the new support level, the GDXJ closed out the shortened Christmas trading week with a breakout above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA). Although it opened Monday’s session down about 1.7 percent, this move represented the first time the GDXJ had closed above its 50-day SMA since late October. Related Link: 3 Bullish MACD Crossovers In The Energy Sector Tough Resistance Ahead Although the breakout was certainly welcome news for frustrated investors, the short-term move has done little to change the longer term bearish technicals of the ETF. For now, bulls will be watching for a breakout above the downward-sloping multi-year resistance line that is currently at around $21.25 and a subsequent breakout above the 200-day SMA at $21.83. If those major resistance levels are broken, investors can begin to realistically hope that 2016 will be a much better year for the GDXJ.

2016-01-13,Gold ETFs Regain Some Luster,"A volatile start to 2016 for global equity markets has sent investors looking for safe-haven alternatives and that search is benefiting gold exchange traded products. That safe-haven ebullience is not limited to physically-backed gold exchange traded funds, such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), though GLD has been able to cobble together modest inflows to start 2016 after losing more than $5.5 billion combined in the previous two years. Rising gold prices are prompting investors revisit gold miners equities and the related ETFs, though funds such as the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) remain locked in long-term bear markets. “Increased market volatility that unseated equity markets in the opening weeks of 2016 have seen commodities stage a bit of a comeback, evidenced by the recent uptick in gold prices. In fact, gold is currently outperforming most global equity indices off the starting gate,” according to a recent Markit note. Still, traders have remained apprehensive when it comes to gold miners ETFs. As of January 11, GDX and GDXJ had taken in any new money this year, though neither ETF experienced outflows, either. Likewise, traders have taken a tepid approach to leveraged gold miners ETFs. On Monday, however, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT), the bullish triple-leveraged answer to GDX, added $26.2 million in new assets while the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: DUST), the leveraged bearish answer to GDX, lost $15.2 million in assets, according to Direxion data. “Resurgence in appetite towards gold has also seen sentiment towards its miners improve. Average short interest across global gold miners, with at least $100m in market cap, has fallen sharply recently, down by 21% to 3.6% of shares outstanding since early 2015. This contrasts with the average short interest of the S&P 500 which is at the highest level seen in over three years,” notes Markit. There is a rub with that short interest data. Short interest data is often viewed as a contrarian indicator, meaning that elevated short interest is seen as a bullish sign because the more forced covering that takes place, the more heavily shorted security rises. Translation: Dwindling short interest in gold miners could imply limited near-term upside for miners ETFs. “While the rise in gold price is positive for the industry, some US based or operating mines will need higher price increases magnitudes to improve their prospects and offset the impact of a stronger local currency,” adds Markit."

2016-02-12,This Little Nugget Of An ETF Is Delivering Astounding Returns,"On Thursday, the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: LABD), a leveraged bearish that is on a torrid pace this year, was highlighted. “Torrid” meaning LABD has nearly tripled in value since the start of the year. By now, it is fair to say that many investors are aware that one of this year's other hot asset classes in addition to bearish biotech ETFs is gold. Investors' thirst for safe-haven assets sent the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest gold exchange traded, higher by 4 percent Thursday to a new 52-week high. Gold, Gold, Gold A volatile start to 2016 for global equity markets has sent investors looking for safe-haven alternatives, and that search is benefiting gold exchange-traded products. Related Link: Gold Is In The Spotlight: Marc Cuban Thinks It Could Be A Safe Haven Of course, bullion's ascent is good news for gold miners and the relevant ETFs, which have a tendency to overshoot gold prices in either direction. That is exactly what the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners 3X Bull Shares (Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JNUG)) is doing. With Thursday's gain of nearly 26.2 percent, JNUG is now up more than 92 percent this year. JNUG is the small-cap answer to the popular Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT)) and the leveraged equivalent of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). On a month-to-date basis, JNUG is up 88.6 percent, trailing only NUGT among Direxion's leveraged bullish ETFs. On Thursday, JNUG was the best-performing ETF in Direxion's stable, topping second-place NUGT by nearly 500 basis points. Predictably, JNUG's ascent is not free of volatility. For example, the ETF's 30-day variance versus its underlying index is 14.8 percent, good for the fourth-highest percentage among Direxion's bullish leveraged ETFs, according to issuer data. JNUG's recent volume increase has been surprisingly modest. Over the past five days, the ETF's volume is 10.2 percent higher than the trailing 20-day average, according to issuer data. What is interesting, though perhaps not surprising, is that traders are missing out on the fun with JNUG as the ETF has averaged $1.1 million in outflows per day over the past month.

2016-06-24,A Golden Side Of The Gold Miners Trade,"If conventional wisdom served to investors prior to the Brexit vote proves accurate, gold's go-go days should continue because at the time of this writing late Thursday night, the BBC is projecting Britons voted in favor of Great Britain leaving the European Union. Not surprisingly, global equity futures and the British pound plunged while safe havens, such as gold and the Japanese yen rallied. So it wouldn't be surprising to see a small amount of equity-based exchange traded funds end the week in the green. Chances are that thin will group will funds such as the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). As has been widely documented, miners and ETFs such as GDX and GDXJ are making major comebacks this year. GDX and GDXJ, the two largest gold miners ETFs, are up 83.8 percent and 107.1 percent, year-to-date, respectively. Related Link: All Big Banks Cleared Stress Test Bar For Cap. Requirements Although it appears unlikely the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this month and the same can probably be said of July, the Fed is intent on boosting borrowing costs. Even it does, U.S. interest rates will still be nowhere to close to historical norms, indicating any punishment delivered to gold ETFs in the wake of rate hikes could be short-lived. Additionally, it looks like NIRP will remain throughout much of the developed world. Obviously, gold miners are getting a lift this year from rising bullion prices, but investors should also acknowledge the improving financial positions of some of the companies found in GDX and GDXJ. During the worst days of golds bear market, many gold miners trimmed fat, opting to pare production and shore balance sheets. “Despite this rally in the price of gold and the higher cash flows that come with it, it is encouraging that the management teams of the gold miners with whom we have recently met remain firmly committed to growing profitability and returns rather than production,” according to VanEck. Gold offers further enticement as a whopping $8 trillion in global investment-grade sovereign debt currently sports negative yields, meaning investors that make those bets will lose money. The World Gold Council adds 40 percent of global sovereign debt sports yields below one percent. We heard more than once in our discussions that a new ounce of production is only good, and will only be added, if it improves or maintains the existing per ounce profitability of the company. Their initiatives have slowly and cautiously started to shift from mere survival to thriving. But caution remains the name of the game,” adds VanEck."

Tuesday’s decline marks the seventh consecutive decline for the GLD and has the ETF set up for its lowest closing price since June. Strength in the U.S. dollar coupled with positive September manufacturing data from the Institute for Supply Management on Monday is likely driving Tuesday’s decline. In the past seven sessions, GLD has declined 4.0 percent, giving up a large chunk of its 2016 gains. Other gold stocks and ETFs have been hit even harder. The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are both down more than 9 percent in the past seven sessions. Not surprisingly, the 3x levered Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JNUG) is down 28.2 percent during the seven-day stretch.

2017-01-09,Interest Remains In Them Thar Gold Miners ETFs,"As is usually the case, the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ), the two largest gold miners exchange traded funds by assets, had interesting years in 2016. All That Glitters After soaring out of the gates to place as two of the best-performing non-leveraged ETFs earlier in the year, GDX, GDXJ and rival gold miners ETFs stumbled later in the year as the dollar strengthened amid expectations of an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve. Gold is more attractive when interest rates are lower because there is no yield as there is on a bond fund, meaning capital appreciation is the only way investors in these products are compensated for taking on gold market risk. With the dollar weak and trillions of dollars (and rising) worth of negative-yielding sovereign debt throughout the developed world, a perfect storm for gold was brewing last year. To their credit, GDX and GDXJ have been strong over the past several weeks. Since December 15, the benchmark gold miners ETFs are up an average of 20.5 percent. Knowing that, it is not surprising that there has recently been some notable options activity in GDX and GDXJ. “We saw what looks like closing put selling in two popular Gold Miner funds this week, as portfolio managers liquidated positions in January 20 puts in GDX, GDXJ (VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners),” said Street One Financial Vice President Paul Weisbruch in a recent note. Trickling Down Increase interest in GDX and GDXJ is, not surprisingly, trickling down to the leveraged equivalents, including the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) and the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: JNUG). Up 35.6 percent and 21 percent, respectively this month, JNUG and NUGT are the best and third-best bullish leveraged ETFs in the Direxion lineup in January. For the five days ending January 6, volume in the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: JDST) was 70.5 percent above the trailing 20-day average while volume in JNUG was nearly 35 percent above its 20-day average, according to Direxion data. “The miners have recovered nicely from their mid-December lows as have spot Gold prices in general and it is possible that portfolio managers are spurning hedges in the space going into this month’s options expiration, or possibly looking to purchase higher strike puts for more protection against a move lower, since these options are now well out-of-the-money,” added Weisbruch."

He feels gold and mining stocks are going to continue its move higher. If you are interested in gold, you can also check SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) as a way to get an exposure to gold."
2020-05-19,"3 Gold Miners ETFs Your Probably Don't Know About, But Should Get To  Know","Gold is one of this year's best performing commodities and that's a theme that could extend as exchange traded fund demand swells and as central banks debase currencies. That's good news for gold miners ETFs, which are already among 2020's leading industry funds. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest fund in the category, is rewarding investors taking a chance on what's usually a volatile product. The fund is higher by nearly 23% year to date. GDX and its small-cap counterpart — the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) — have a way of crowding out the other ETFs in this group, but some of the other undiscovered funds here are turning in great performances in their own rights. With that in mind, here are some hidden gems of the gold miners ETF space to consider. Sprott Gold Miners ETF (SGDM) The Sprott Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:SGDM), which has recently been making a series of all-time highs, is an odd choice for an overlooked because it's neither small nor young. Just a couple of months shy of its sixth birthday, SGDM has $240.5 million in assets under management. The fund is a departure from cap-weighted rivals such as GDX. SGDM follows the Solactive Gold Miners Custom Factors Index, which focuses on “larger-sized gold companies with the highest revenue growth, free cash flow yield and the lowest long-term debt to equity,” according to the issuer. Low debt, well-capitalized firms, regardless of industry, are rewarding investors this year and that's true in the precious metals mining space as SGDM is higher by 24% year to date. U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (GOAU) The U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE:GOAU) is truly unique among its gold mining ETF rivals because it blends exposure to production firms with royalty operators, which are passive participants in the industry. Royalty and streaming companies comprise about a third of GOAU's index. The fund follows the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners Index, which is rooted in quantitative analysis. There are some perks to the royalty exposure including reduced volatility, higher dividends and lower operating costs. GOAU is higher by almost 29% over the past month. Global X Gold Explorers ETF (GOEX) At nearly 10 years old, the Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE:GOEX) is one of the oldest products in this category and it's experiencing a renaissance this year as confirmed by a 27.49% surge over the past month. GOEX components have a weighted average market value of $1.98 billion, making this a small-cap play on gold explorers. That's a volatile combination, but it's one that can pay off if both gold and smaller stocks remain simultaneously remain firm."
2020-06-03,'Fast Money' Traders Weigh In On Gold,"On CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report, Meghan Shue said that short-term fundamentals suggest a mixed outlook for gold in the near term. She would look for a better entry point. Joe Terranova said he always likes to have gold in his portfolio because it offers diversification. He added that in the current environment, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) would work better than SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Pete Najarian also likes the miners and he would consider individual names that provide exposure to gold. He currently owns SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (NYSE:XME), which has a mix of metals and gold names."
2020-06-09,Gold Isn't The Only Reason This Miners ETF Is Soaring,"Some commodities are getting absolutely wrecked this year, but that's not the case with gold. When gold glitters, it has a tendency to overshadow other precious metals, as it's doing this year. What Happened The VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ), one of the largest exchange traded funds in this category, is sporting a second-quarter gain of almost 22%. Given the ETF's name, it would be reasonable to assume that gold is power this ETF higher, but there's more to the story. As noted above, gold overshadows silver, but the Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF (NYSE:SIVR) is higher by more than 16% over the past month and that's helping GDXJ. Why It's Important GDXJ's underlying index tracks “the overall performance of small-capitalization companies that are involved primarily in the mining for gold and/or silver,” according to VanEck. The emphasis is on silver, as GDXJ's silver miners exposure is proving useful. “Silver performance has lagged gold for a number of years, driving the gold/silver ratio to an all-time high of 123 in March,” VanEck said in a recent note. “Silver mounted a comeback in May, gaining 18.3%, amid some of the strongest inflows into silver bullion exchange-traded funds since their inception. Silver might see further gains as it is still underperforming gold by 14% this year and the gold/silver ratio remains at 97, far above the five-year average of 80.” Many of GDXJ's top 10 holdings, which combine for 45.45% of the fund's roster, produce silver in addition to gold and some of the fund's holdings are dedicated silver miners. What's Next Obviously, GDXJ is a small-cap fund, and as is the case with small caps, it's been lagging its large-cap counterparts. If small-cap stocks are showing plenty of signs of life, that could facilitate a another move higher in GDXJ. “In a bull market, large-cap companies typically move first, followed by stronger performance by mid-tiers and juniors as the market advances,” according to VanEck. “The lag in performance between the large and smaller companies is normally measured in weeks. However, after a year we are still waiting for the smaller companies to outperform. Since gold broke out on June 20, 2019, the GDM, which is heavily weighted majors (66% as of the end of May), has gained 45.6%. The MVGDXJ, with an 87% combined weight in mid-tiers and juniors, has failed to outperform, gaining 44.4% over the same period. Investor sentiment has remained low so far in this cycle. We believe this is finally beginning to change, as shown by the 7.0% outperformance of MVGDXJ in May.”"
2020-08-03,Gold Just Hit An All-Time (Nominal) High—How To Play The Trade With ETFs,"Gold bugs who were in front of their screens on Sunday night witnessed history for the second week in a row. At the 6 pm ET open on August 2, the spot price of gold rose to $2009.50 per ounce, a new all-time high on a nominal (non-inflation adjusted) basis. It was the second week in a row that gold made a new all-time high in the Sunday night session, as the same thing happened the evening of July 26. Spot gold is up almost 36% over the previous 12 months, a stunning turnaround for an asset that drastically underperformed equities for the last decade. For those investors who stayed the course and the traders who’ve been betting on upside, Sunday night was validation. So why did gold just make a new all-time high? It’s 2020—the real question is why not? The safe-haven asset has the benefit of several macro tailwinds playing out at the same time. The EU’s record-breaking $858 billion bailout package combined with near-zero interest rates from global central banks has signaled that monetary easing and fiscal stimulus will be more than a short-term reality. At the same time, rising tensions last week between the U.S. and China has set the stage for another geopolitical showdown, which carries with it far more unknowns than any market (or person, for that matter) should be comfortable with. And all this is to say nothing of the fact that coronavirus cases continue to rise in the U.S. How To Play Gold Via ETFs As gold has ascended in recent months so too have gold ETFs, as many traders and investors use them to get exposure. According to the World Gold Council, gold-backed ETFs added $5.6 billion worth of assets in June, their seventh consecutive month of global positive flows. And based on July’s performance, that streak could continue. Take the two largest gold miners ETFs by assets: the VanEck Vectors® Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX, )) and the VanEck Vectors® Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ, )). The pair has returned 42% and 38% respectively in 2020, as of August 3. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of GDX (candles) compared with GDXJ (purple line). Source: Benzinga Pro; Data as of August 3, 2020 The strength in GDX can be attributed to names like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corp (NYSE:FNV), and Wheaton Precious Metals Corp (NYSE:WPM). Combined, the group makes up over 38% of the fund and is up an average of 60% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the strength in GDXJ can be attributed to top holdings Gold Fields Ltd (NYSE:GFI) (up 98% YTD), Kinross Gold Corp (NYSE:KGC) (up 97%), and Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE:AUY) (up 64%), which combine to make up nearly 17% of the fund. For investors interested in gold bullion, the VanEck® Merk® Gold Trust (NYSE:OUNZ) actually allows investors to own physical gold via their ownership of the ETF and even take delivery of the gold they own, if desired. Note that taking delivery of gold does come with a fee. In short, market risk is very much on. And when risk is on, so is gold."
2020-11-09,A Golden Idea Among Gold ETFs,"In the commodities complex, gold is one of this year's big stories, one that's, of course, trickling down to exchange-traded funds. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed ETF, is up 28.19% year-to-date. What Happened: What's good for gold is usually good for miners and what's good for the miners usually matriculates down to their small-cap brethren. Check out the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ), which is higher by 41.13% year-to-date. The $6.6 billion GDXJ, which tracks the Global Junior Gold Miners Index and holds 84 stocks, could continue standing as one of the preferred ways to play the yellow metal. Why It's Important: Historically, gold performs modestly when a Democrat is in the White House, the scenario investors will be seeing in the new year. Then there's speculation about rising inflation and dollar-destructive deficit spending, both of which should be constructive for gold and miners. Still, some market observers see a murky near-term outlook for bullion while remaining bullish on miners. See Also: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now? “Most believe gold and silver can perform with this market backdrop. Market agents are trying to marry a chart to an upside price fantasy,” said Rareview Macro founder Neil Azous in a recent note. “We highlight this because precious metal spot prices typically form patterns that help identify large potential moves. Currently, we see no continuation pattern that is recognizable on a chart.” What's Next: GDXJ does have some tailwinds, including rising momentum for smaller stocks and faint hopes that the dollar will strengthen anytime soon. Additionally, miners aren't just benefiting from higher gold prices. The industry is reining in costs and strengthening balance sheets, increasing the allure of GDJX for near- to medium-term investors. And for those that need a little more coaxing, Azous points out GDXJ's technical situation is somewhat attractive. “If you must add new exposure, we would instead add junior miners than spot gold,” he said. “While we are not fans of diagonal patterns, we would note that the junior gold miners (GDXJ) broke out of a downtrend channel on a weekly closing basis.” Data indicate some investors are willing to side with GDJX. In the third quarter, the ETF hauled in over $310 million in new cash."
2020-12-03,"New ETNs Bring Leverage, Spice To Gold Miners","Gold is hot this year and the miners are even hotter, a scenario bringing more light to the various leveraged exchange traded products that provide access to the companies extracting gold from the earth. What Happened: In other words, it's a good time for traders to consider some fresh approaches to bullion miners. REX Shares, the issuer behind the MicroSectors lineup of leveraged exchange traded notes, has those traders covered with a pair of new exchange traded notes (ETNs). The MicroSectors Gold Miners Leveraged 3X ETN (NYSE:GDXU) and the MicroSectors Gold Miners -3X Inverse Leveraged ETN (NYSE:GDXD) launch Thursday, joining well-known products, such as the MicroSectors™ FANG+™ Index 3X Leveraged ETN (NYSE:FNGU) and the MicroSectors™ FANG+™ ETN (NYSE:FNGS) in the MicroSectors stable. Why It's Important: GDXU and GDXD, the new geared gold ETNs, bring a unique approach. The products track the S-Network MicroSectors™ Gold Miners Index. That benchmark is a combination of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ), the two largest non-leveraged bullion miners ETFs by assets. The index is half allocated to the large-cap GDX and half allocated to the small-cap GDXJ. “Each ETN offers investors a return based on changes in the level of the S-Network MicroSectors™ Gold Miners Index on a daily compounded basis, before taking into account fees. Each ETN has a specified leverage factor that is reset daily,” according to MicroSectors. What's Next: Obviously, as leveraged products, GDXU and the bearish GDXD are expected to pack a punch, but that's certainly the case with these products because, on an unleveraged basis, miners are typically volatile bets. GDX has a three-year standard deviation of 33.23%, well above that of broader equity benchmarks and standard industry funds. The small-cap GDXJ has a three-year standard deviation of 38.68%, making it far more volatile than any traditional small-cap benchmark and confirming the MicroSectors ETNs could thrive when action heats up in the miners complex. With the debuts of GDXU and GDXD, MicroSectors offers over 21 ETNs, spanning FANG stocks, big banks, the energy sector, and the first leveraged cannabis products to list in the U.S."
2021-07-20,Unusual Options Activity Insight: VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF,"VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved up to $43.41 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-09-17 Strike Price: $43.00 Volume: 441 Open Interest: 77 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2022-01-21 Strike Price: $40.00 Volume: 782 Open Interest: 4327 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of unsettled contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed, is called open interest. These contracts are not yet closed because a buyer has not purchased the contract, or a seller has not sold it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option.

2022-04-12,Economic War Against A Real Economy: How the West May Have Underestimated Russia,"The War In Ukraine: Atoms Versus Bits Judging by the coverage in most of the Western media, Russia is getting soundly beaten in its war with Ukraine. That may be an artifact of the West's (and Ukraine's) superiority at electronic media. The Ukrainian President, Vladimir Zelensky, is, after all, a former television star and producer, who understands media well. And Western media are full of stories of plucky Ukrainian defenders defeating bumbling Russian invaders, such as this article from the Financial Times. Great reportage: how Ukraine inflicted a stinging defeat on Russian forces at the Battle of Kyiv https://t.co/aRNhDenRx9 — Lionel Barber (@lionelbarber) April 11, 2022 Some military experts, such as retired U.S. Army Colonel Douglas Macgregor, say that the Russian army never intended to take Kiev, that its forces deployed in the vicinity of Kiev were merely meant to tie down Ukrainian forces. But those experts have been losing the media war along with Russia. So much for the media (bits). What about the physical world (atoms)? There, the picture looks starkly different. According to the data above, Ukraine has lost 91% of its tanks since Russia invaded, while Russia has lost 6.9% of its tanks. A Similar Dynamic At Work In The Economic War A similar dynamic may be at work in the West's economic war against Russia. Over the weekend, the Financial Times expressed incredulity that contrarian fund manager Dave Iben hadn't written down his position in Gazprom--which has shipped record amounts of gas to Europe throughout the war--to zero. Contrarian fund manager cautions against writing off Russia assets https://t.co/z4Cm226dxq — Financial Times (@FT) April 10, 2022 Similarly, President Biden quipped after levying unprecedented sanctions on Russia that the ruble was now rubble, but Russia's currency has already recovered to pre-war levels. It appears that the laptop class in the West has underestimated the resilience and size of Russia's economy because it's more based on the physical world than ours is. That observation was fleshed out by French economist Jacques Sapir, as Arnaud Bertrand shared in the Twitter thread below. Contrarian fund manager cautions against writing off Russia assets https://t.co/z4Cm226dxq — Financial Times (@FT) April 10, 2022 However this is the worst possible way of comparing the size of economies. A slightly more accurate way is to adjust for PPP (purchasing power parity: https://t.co/SmlsvzplMB) When you do so, you already realize that Russia's economy is actually more like the size of Germany's. — Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) April 10, 2022 He says that when you adjust for this Russia's economy is vastly bigger than Germany's. His estimate is that Russia represents in fact maybe 5% or 6% of the world's economy, almost double the size it's normally estimated at on a PPP basis (https://t.co/I0WHghMEk3) — Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) April 10, 2022 This is a fascinating way to look at it and it rings very true. This crisis is making us realize that we used to take manufacturing, the industry and commodities for granted, i.e. an antiquated side of the economy compared to shiny new services. — Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) April 10, 2022 Bertrand then extends this analysis to China and America. It's also very interesting to revalue China's economy through that lens. If we look at the Chinese economy simply based on exchange rates, it is a $17.7 trillion economy to the U.S.'s $23 trillion. — Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) April 10, 2022 All in all, this means that China and Russia's economies combined are in fact likely about 35% of the world's economy when taking PPP into account as well as compensating for the over-valuation of the service sector. — Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) April 10, 2022 Focusing On The Physical If you look at our top names from Friday, our system is not taking the physical world, and the economy based on it, for granted. Screen capture via Portfolio Armor on 4/8/2022. Here's how that top ten breaks down: Wheat: Teucrium Wheat Fund (NYSE:WEAT) Oil & Gas: Occidental Petroleum Corp.

2022-09-14,The VanEck Junior Miners Index: What It Consists Of And Why It's Interesting Now,"The VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) consisting of mostly medium to smallish precious metals companies. For investors looking to diversify broadly in that sector, it’s quite interesting. Some of the components include Yamana Gold Inc. (NYSE:AUY) with 5.97% of the fund, Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC) with 5.74% and Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE:PAAS) with 4.57% – he best known of the miners represented. Among the lesser-known names are smaller outfits such as Endeavour Mining PLC (OTC:EDVMF) with 4.05%, B2Gold Corp. (NYSE:BTG) with 3.95% and Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) with 3.54%. As of Sept. 7, the fund held 100 positions with most of the rest of the components representing small and very small operations, all of which are publicly traded. The idea here is that investors gain broad ownership of many different medium and small mining operations so that diversification beyond the huge miners – Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM) and Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD), for example – is achieved. See also: How to Invest in Gold in 2022 For investors concerned with the possibility of increased inflation, it’s a fascinating concept. Here’s the daily price chart: Note the positive divergences appearing on the relative strength indicator (RSI) and on the moving average convergence/divergence indicator (MACD), both below the price chart. There is less downward pressure each time this fund hits a new low, which is the significance of the divergences. This kind of look can mean that selling is drying up and giving way to buying. Here’s the daily price chart for the largest holding, Yamana Gold: Notice how the MACD is trending higher as the September low barely takes out the early July low. The RSI is not showing it yet, but it may be early for this position. Note that the early January 2022 are holding thus far. This is the daily price chart for the second-largest holding, Kinross Gold: This is a clear example of the steadily rising RSI and MACD indicators showing positive divergences to the price action. Note that the September low remains (so far) above the mid-July low. Kinross is adding a 3.48% dividend to the fund as a bonus. And here’s the price chart for the third-largest component, Pan American Silver: This one adds excellent exposure to the silver mining market. The look here is more dramatic with the fall from the April high to the recent low. Nonetheless, the moving average convergence/divergence indicator is suggesting a slowing of selling momentum. The RSI doesn’t yet agree. For diversification into medium to smaller miners, as a hedge for fear of greater inflation, VanEck may be worth a look. Related: How Much is a Gold Bar Worth?

2023-03-17,"Gold Rallies Eyeing $2,000/oz As Recession Looms – These 3 ETFs To Gain From Precious Metal's Bull Wave","Gold has had a textbook rally following the tumultuous week in the U.S. banking sector and heavy drops in Fed hike expectations as recession risks loom. On Friday, gold surged 2% beyond $1,950/oz levels, putting it on track for a 6% weekly gain, its largest since early November 2022. The precious metal is regarded as the premier safe haven asset in this current market climate since it does not carry any default concerns, has continuously maintained its value through periods of persistent inflation, and generally climbs during times of economic slowdown and recession. Next: 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' Author Says You Should Invest In These Two Assets Amid Silicon Valley Bank's Collapse Gold is very sensitive to rate movements because higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of investing in non-yielding assets like gold, and vice versa. A weaker dollar, lower Treasury yields, and a collapse in expectations for the Fed's rate hikes are all contributing to gold's bullish momentum. Fed swaps now price in a 19 basis point hike in March, with the terminal rate forecast to reach 4.9% in May and then fall from there. Overall, there are three 25-basis-point rate cuts priced until December 2023. Short-term two-year Treasury yields fell by more than 40 basis points this week, the largest drop since October 1987's Black Monday. Gold technical analysis: Bull flag pattern in place Gold price daily timeframe – Chart: TradingView Gold prices broke through a multi-resistance zone this week, which included the 50-day moving average, the psychological $1,900/oz level, and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the high-to-low range from 2022. After the breakout of the flag channel, we can observe the emergence of a bullish flag pattern on the price chart, which may presage an extension of the current rally. The next resistance level is between 1,975 and 1,980, which corresponds to the 2023 price high as well as the 78.6% Fibonacci level. Breaking through this barrier will boost the bull's momentum and improve the chances of an assault on the psychological 2,000 mark. 3 Gold ETFs to Watch: GLD, GDX, GDXJ SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and Junior Gold Miners VanEck Vectors ETF (NYSE:GDX) GDXJ are three ETFs to watch for investors looking to profit on gold's rally. 1) GLD SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) is an exchange-traded fund managed by World Gold Trust Services, LLC that invests in gold bullions and is linked to physical gold performance. As a result, its price moves in lockstep with the commodity, and it does not pay dividends. GLD saw its highest weekly net inflow in almost a year in the week ended March 16, totalling $709.5 million. GLD price chart and weekly ETF flows – Chart: Koyfin 2) GDX The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in the stocks of companies in the gold mining industry. It tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index's performance through a complete replication. Dividends are paid once a year, and the current dividend yield is 1.6%. GDX's major holdings include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:EAM). In the week ending March 16, GDX received $52 million in weekly net inflows, after around $240 million in outflows the previous week. GDX price chart and weekly ETF flows – Chart: Koyfin 3) GDXJ The VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE:GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in stocks of companies involved in the gold mining industry. Differently from GDX, the majority of these companies are still in the development and exploratory phases and are seeking for land with a high potential for significant mineral deposits. Junior gold miners are thus more volatile than already productive gold miners, which is why GDXJ has a greater volatility than GDX. GDXJ's top holdings include Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC), Yamana Gold Inc. (NYSE:AUY), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI), and Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE:PAAS). The last week's ETF flow data is missing, but GDXJ had $24 million in outflows in the week ending March 9.

2023-06-09,Why Are Precious Metals Miners Rallying? 5 Mining Stocks To Watch,"Shares of precious metals miners rallied on Thursday, with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) tracking the industry posting a 1.2% rise for the session and several mining stocks reporting solid gains. Thursday’s unexpected surge in unemployment claims, sparked fears about a weakening labor market and triggered positive reactions for gold and silver mining companies. According to the latest CME Group Fed Watch tool, investors have placed their bets on the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates unchanged next week, assigning a nearly 75% probability. Both the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields fell for the session, while precious metals rose, as the risk of an additional hike faded, at least for now. Gold, tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), gained 1.3%, while silver, tracked by the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV), climbed 3.7%.

2023-07-24,Unlocking Gold Mining's Supercycle: Insights From Benzinga's Virtual Conference,"In the latest virtual conference presented by Benzinga, three outstanding experts and industry professionals gathered to explore the prospects of a new “Supercycle” for gold miners. Delving into crucial factors affecting the performance of gold mining stocks, they discussed Fed interest rates, market valuations, geopolitics, ESG and technological innovation in the industry. In the first part, Imaru Casanova, a portfolio manager for Gold and Precious Metals at VanEck, highlighted the potential bullish catalysts for gold miners and presented her top stock recommendations. Taylor McKenna, CFA and an analyst at Kopernik Global Investors, emphasized the value of gold mining stocks and discussed the application of AI technologies. Luke Norman, co-founder and executive chairman at US Gold Corp. (NYSE:USAU), offered insights into the gold mining exploration side and the permitting cycle. VanEck Sees Attractive Valuations In The Gold Mining Industry VanEck’s Casanova expressed optimism about the outlook for gold miners, citing the end of the Fed tightening cycle as a potential bullish catalyst. With strong global support in the current environment, gold miners are poised to demonstrate their leverage with higher gold prices. Casanova highlighted the historically low multiples at which gold mining stocks are currently trading, coupled with controlled balance sheet costs, generate an attractive investment opportunity. “When gold traded at these levels (around $1,970) in the past, stocks in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) or VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) index were trading 15-20% higher,” Casanova said. Regarding top stock recommendations, Casanova identified Endeavor Mining PLC (OTCPK: EDVMF), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI), and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM). She emphasized that VanEck’s current price forecast for gold is $2,075 per ounce in the next 12 months, which offers a compelling case for diversification and growth in the gold mining sector. Read Also: Agnico Eagle Mines’ Debt Overview Kopernik Global Investors Is Bullish On Smaller Miners Kopernik Global Investors’ McKenna expressed strong conviction in gold mining, pointing out the attractive valuations the sector offers. McKenna discussed the opportunity in smaller companies within the industry such as Seabridge Gold Inc. (NYSE:SA), International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. (NYSE:THM), and Western Copper and Gold Corp. (NYSE:WRN), which trade at even cheaper valuations than big miners but carry higher risk. Among the majors he highlighted is Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) offers attractive valuations as it shows an all-in-sustaining cost (AISC) of $1,400 an ounce, positioning the company for significant potential if gold prices continue to rise. McKenna also stressed the importance of scrutinizing management teams and incentives, and he shared insights into how AI technologies, such as driverless trucks for mining, are being employed to boost productivity and reduce environmental impact. US Gold Corp’s Vision for the Greenest Mine in North America US Gold Corp.’s Norman shed light on the gold mining exploration and permitting cycle. He emphasized that smaller companies involved in gold exploration often become investment vehicles for larger corporations in the sector. Norman provided an overview of US Gold Corp.’s primary project, the CK Gold project, and its location just outside Cheyenne, Wyoming. “Navigating the permitting process in North America can be challenging, with federal agencies causing bottlenecks,” Norman said. Norman did highlight the advantage of working with the state of Wyoming, which has set a mandate for a more streamlined permitting timeline. Despite trading at a significant market discount due to perceived permitting challenges, US Gold Corp. has 1.5 million ounces of reserves in the ground, and its all-in-sustaining costs are projected at $800 per ounce. Norman believed the in-situ value of reserves in the ground should place U.S. Gold Corp’s market cap to about $300 million, while the company is currently trading at about $40 million market cap. Norman highlighted how ESG became a hugely important factor in the business and he aspired to develop the greenest mine in North America.

2023-08-04,Investors Cheer Jobs Report: Why Are These 5 Stocks And 5 ETFs Shining On Friday?,"The July jobs report issued Friday delivered mixed takeaways for the market, although it confirmed an overall healthy U.S. labor market. On one hand, the pace of nonfarm payrolls growth fell short of forecasts in July, with 187,000 jobs gained compared to the expected 200,000. On the other hand, the jobless rate fell to 3.5%, exceeding expectations of 3.6%. Wages increased at a monthly pace of 0.4% and an annual rate of 4.4%, which was faster than expected. Biden, Fed Governor On July’s Jobs Report The market interpreted the jobs report in a dovish manner, lowering expectations for potential interest rate hikes in September. Market-derived probabilities put the chance of a 25-basis-point hike in September at 13%, down from 19% before the report was issued Friday morning. President Joe Biden applauded the job market data, emphasizing that the share of working-age Americans with jobs has reached a 20-year high. He attributes this positive trend to the effects of his economic policies, often referred to as “Bidenomics.” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the Fed is likely to remain into restrictive territory well into 2024 and said he is unsurprised wages remain strong. Five stocks from the Russell 1000 index (large-cap) and five exchange-traded funds had substantial price action in the opening minutes of trading Friday as a result of jobs data and the movement in interest rates, as well as statements regarding quarterly corporate results.

2023-10-18,Gold Miners Positioned For Upswing: Keep An Eye On This Leading Economic Indicator,"A fundamental gauge in the world of finance and economics has just provided a signal not to be underestimated. We are talking about the gold-to-copper ratio, which can offer valuable insights into the overall health of the global economy and financial markets. This ratio represents the strength of a safe-haven asset, such as gold, which tends to rise during periods of market and economic turmoil, in comparison to copper, often considered a barometer for industrial production and seen as the driving force behind global economic growth. In practice, it indicates how many pounds of copper one ounce of gold can purchase. As highlighted by SentimenTrader on social media platform X, the “copper-to-gold ratio has recently crossed a crucial threshold, signaling positive prospects for metals and mining.” When examining the chart, this indicator surpassed the value of 544 on Wednesday, reaching its highest level since the end of May 2023. The ratio is now approaching a significant resistance zone, marked by a triple-top pattern that occurred in December 2020, July 2022, and May 2023. Why Is Gold Rising? The conflict in the Middle East has so far benefited two commodities: gold and oil. While the increase in oil prices is primarily due to rising geopolitical and supply risks in the region, what has garnered more attention in recent weeks is the surge in gold prices. This is because not only has the price of gold risen by 6% since Hamas carried out terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, but it has also done so while Treasury yields and the dollar were on the rise, breaking its usual negative correlation with these variables. According to Otavio Costa, a partner and macro strategist at Crescat Capital, gold appears to be on a path toward reaching $2,000 per ounce again, indicating the potential for a significant breakout that could mark the beginning of another long-term cycle. Costa referenced a statement made by Ray Dalio: “If you don’t own gold, you know neither history nor economics.” Gold approaching $2,000/oz again, now poised for a historical break out that could mark the beginning of another long-term cycle.Ray Dalio put it succinctly:If you don't own gold, you know neither history nor economics pic.twitter.com/FZSBCo7FZm— Otavio (Tavi) Costa (@TaviCosta) October 18, 2023 Gold Miners Outperformed Gold miners have emerged as the top-performing industry in October.
