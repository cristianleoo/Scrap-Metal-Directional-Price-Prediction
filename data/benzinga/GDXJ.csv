2020-05-19,"3 Gold Miners ETFs Your Probably Don't Know About, But Should Get To  Know","Gold is one of this year's best performing commodities and that's a theme that could extend as exchange traded fund demand swells and as central banks debase currencies. That's good news for gold miners ETFs, which are already among 2020's leading industry funds. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX), the largest fund in the category, is rewarding investors taking a chance on what's usually a volatile product. The fund is higher by nearly 23% year to date. GDX and its small-cap counterpart — the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) — have a way of crowding out the other ETFs in this group, but some of the other undiscovered funds here are turning in great performances in their own rights. With that in mind, here are some hidden gems of the gold miners ETF space to consider. Sprott Gold Miners ETF (SGDM) The Sprott Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:SGDM), which has recently been making a series of all-time highs, is an odd choice for an overlooked because it's neither small nor young. Just a couple of months shy of its sixth birthday, SGDM has $240.5 million in assets under management. The fund is a departure from cap-weighted rivals such as GDX. SGDM follows the Solactive Gold Miners Custom Factors Index, which focuses on “larger-sized gold companies with the highest revenue growth, free cash flow yield and the lowest long-term debt to equity,” according to the issuer. Low debt, well-capitalized firms, regardless of industry, are rewarding investors this year and that's true in the precious metals mining space as SGDM is higher by 24% year to date. U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (GOAU) The U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners ETF (NYSE:GOAU) is truly unique among its gold mining ETF rivals because it blends exposure to production firms with royalty operators, which are passive participants in the industry. Royalty and streaming companies comprise about a third of GOAU's index. The fund follows the U.S. Global GO GOLD and Precious Metal Miners Index, which is rooted in quantitative analysis. There are some perks to the royalty exposure including reduced volatility, higher dividends and lower operating costs. GOAU is higher by almost 29% over the past month. Global X Gold Explorers ETF (GOEX) At nearly 10 years old, the Global X Gold Explorers ETF (NYSE:GOEX) is one of the oldest products in this category and it's experiencing a renaissance this year as confirmed by a 27.49% surge over the past month. GOEX components have a weighted average market value of $1.98 billion, making this a small-cap play on gold explorers. That's a volatile combination, but it's one that can pay off if both gold and smaller stocks remain simultaneously remain firm."
2020-06-03,'Fast Money' Traders Weigh In On Gold,"On CNBC's Fast Money Halftime Report, Meghan Shue said that short-term fundamentals suggest a mixed outlook for gold in the near term. She would look for a better entry point. Joe Terranova said he always likes to have gold in his portfolio because it offers diversification. He added that in the current environment, VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) would work better than SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). Pete Najarian also likes the miners and he would consider individual names that provide exposure to gold. He currently owns SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (NYSE:XME), which has a mix of metals and gold names."
2020-06-09,Gold Isn't The Only Reason This Miners ETF Is Soaring,"Some commodities are getting absolutely wrecked this year, but that's not the case with gold. When gold glitters, it has a tendency to overshadow other precious metals, as it's doing this year. What Happened The VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ), one of the largest exchange traded funds in this category, is sporting a second-quarter gain of almost 22%. Given the ETF's name, it would be reasonable to assume that gold is power this ETF higher, but there's more to the story. As noted above, gold overshadows silver, but the Aberdeen Standard Physical Silver Shares ETF (NYSE:SIVR) is higher by more than 16% over the past month and that's helping GDXJ. Why It's Important GDXJ's underlying index tracks “the overall performance of small-capitalization companies that are involved primarily in the mining for gold and/or silver,” according to VanEck. The emphasis is on silver, as GDXJ's silver miners exposure is proving useful. “Silver performance has lagged gold for a number of years, driving the gold/silver ratio to an all-time high of 123 in March,” VanEck said in a recent note. “Silver mounted a comeback in May, gaining 18.3%, amid some of the strongest inflows into silver bullion exchange-traded funds since their inception. Silver might see further gains as it is still underperforming gold by 14% this year and the gold/silver ratio remains at 97, far above the five-year average of 80.” Many of GDXJ's top 10 holdings, which combine for 45.45% of the fund's roster, produce silver in addition to gold and some of the fund's holdings are dedicated silver miners. What's Next Obviously, GDXJ is a small-cap fund, and as is the case with small caps, it's been lagging its large-cap counterparts. If small-cap stocks are showing plenty of signs of life, that could facilitate a another move higher in GDXJ. “In a bull market, large-cap companies typically move first, followed by stronger performance by mid-tiers and juniors as the market advances,” according to VanEck. “The lag in performance between the large and smaller companies is normally measured in weeks. However, after a year we are still waiting for the smaller companies to outperform. Since gold broke out on June 20, 2019, the GDM, which is heavily weighted majors (66% as of the end of May), has gained 45.6%. The MVGDXJ, with an 87% combined weight in mid-tiers and juniors, has failed to outperform, gaining 44.4% over the same period. Investor sentiment has remained low so far in this cycle. We believe this is finally beginning to change, as shown by the 7.0% outperformance of MVGDXJ in May.”"
2020-08-03,Gold Just Hit An All-Time (Nominal) High—How To Play The Trade With ETFs,"Gold bugs who were in front of their screens on Sunday night witnessed history for the second week in a row. At the 6 pm ET open on August 2, the spot price of gold rose to $2009.50 per ounce, a new all-time high on a nominal (non-inflation adjusted) basis. It was the second week in a row that gold made a new all-time high in the Sunday night session, as the same thing happened the evening of July 26. Spot gold is up almost 36% over the previous 12 months, a stunning turnaround for an asset that drastically underperformed equities for the last decade. For those investors who stayed the course and the traders who’ve been betting on upside, Sunday night was validation. So why did gold just make a new all-time high? It’s 2020—the real question is why not? The safe-haven asset has the benefit of several macro tailwinds playing out at the same time. The EU’s record-breaking $858 billion bailout package combined with near-zero interest rates from global central banks has signaled that monetary easing and fiscal stimulus will be more than a short-term reality. At the same time, rising tensions last week between the U.S. and China has set the stage for another geopolitical showdown, which carries with it far more unknowns than any market (or person, for that matter) should be comfortable with. And all this is to say nothing of the fact that coronavirus cases continue to rise in the U.S. How To Play Gold Via ETFs As gold has ascended in recent months so too have gold ETFs, as many traders and investors use them to get exposure. According to the World Gold Council, gold-backed ETFs added $5.6 billion worth of assets in June, their seventh consecutive month of global positive flows. And based on July’s performance, that streak could continue. Take the two largest gold miners ETFs by assets: the VanEck Vectors® Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX, )) and the VanEck Vectors® Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ, )). The pair has returned 42% and 38% respectively in 2020, as of August 3. The chart below shows the year-to-date performance of GDX (candles) compared with GDXJ (purple line). Source: Benzinga Pro; Data as of August 3, 2020 The strength in GDX can be attributed to names like Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corp (NYSE:FNV), and Wheaton Precious Metals Corp (NYSE:WPM). Combined, the group makes up over 38% of the fund and is up an average of 60% year-to-date. Meanwhile, the strength in GDXJ can be attributed to top holdings Gold Fields Ltd (NYSE:GFI) (up 98% YTD), Kinross Gold Corp (NYSE:KGC) (up 97%), and Yamana Gold Inc (NYSE:AUY) (up 64%), which combine to make up nearly 17% of the fund. For investors interested in gold bullion, the VanEck® Merk® Gold Trust (NYSE:OUNZ) actually allows investors to own physical gold via their ownership of the ETF and even take delivery of the gold they own, if desired. Note that taking delivery of gold does come with a fee. In short, market risk is very much on. And when risk is on, so is gold."
2020-11-09,A Golden Idea Among Gold ETFs,"In the commodities complex, gold is one of this year's big stories, one that's, of course, trickling down to exchange-traded funds. For example, the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE:GLD), the world's largest gold-backed ETF, is up 28.19% year-to-date. What Happened: What's good for gold is usually good for miners and what's good for the miners usually matriculates down to their small-cap brethren. Check out the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ), which is higher by 41.13% year-to-date. The $6.6 billion GDXJ, which tracks the Global Junior Gold Miners Index and holds 84 stocks, could continue standing as one of the preferred ways to play the yellow metal. Why It's Important: Historically, gold performs modestly when a Democrat is in the White House, the scenario investors will be seeing in the new year. Then there's speculation about rising inflation and dollar-destructive deficit spending, both of which should be constructive for gold and miners. Still, some market observers see a murky near-term outlook for bullion while remaining bullish on miners. See Also: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now? “Most believe gold and silver can perform with this market backdrop. Market agents are trying to marry a chart to an upside price fantasy,” said Rareview Macro founder Neil Azous in a recent note. “We highlight this because precious metal spot prices typically form patterns that help identify large potential moves. Currently, we see no continuation pattern that is recognizable on a chart.” What's Next: GDXJ does have some tailwinds, including rising momentum for smaller stocks and faint hopes that the dollar will strengthen anytime soon. Additionally, miners aren't just benefiting from higher gold prices. The industry is reining in costs and strengthening balance sheets, increasing the allure of GDJX for near- to medium-term investors. And for those that need a little more coaxing, Azous points out GDXJ's technical situation is somewhat attractive. “If you must add new exposure, we would instead add junior miners than spot gold,” he said. “While we are not fans of diagonal patterns, we would note that the junior gold miners (GDXJ) broke out of a downtrend channel on a weekly closing basis.” Data indicate some investors are willing to side with GDJX. In the third quarter, the ETF hauled in over $310 million in new cash."
2020-12-03,"New ETNs Bring Leverage, Spice To Gold Miners","Gold is hot this year and the miners are even hotter, a scenario bringing more light to the various leveraged exchange traded products that provide access to the companies extracting gold from the earth. What Happened: In other words, it's a good time for traders to consider some fresh approaches to bullion miners. REX Shares, the issuer behind the MicroSectors lineup of leveraged exchange traded notes, has those traders covered with a pair of new exchange traded notes (ETNs). The MicroSectors Gold Miners Leveraged 3X ETN (NYSE:GDXU) and the MicroSectors Gold Miners -3X Inverse Leveraged ETN (NYSE:GDXD) launch Thursday, joining well-known products, such as the MicroSectors™ FANG+™ Index 3X Leveraged ETN (NYSE:FNGU) and the MicroSectors™ FANG+™ ETN (NYSE:FNGS) in the MicroSectors stable. Why It's Important: GDXU and GDXD, the new geared gold ETNs, bring a unique approach. The products track the S-Network MicroSectors™ Gold Miners Index. That benchmark is a combination of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ), the two largest non-leveraged bullion miners ETFs by assets. The index is half allocated to the large-cap GDX and half allocated to the small-cap GDXJ. “Each ETN offers investors a return based on changes in the level of the S-Network MicroSectors™ Gold Miners Index on a daily compounded basis, before taking into account fees. Each ETN has a specified leverage factor that is reset daily,” according to MicroSectors. What's Next: Obviously, as leveraged products, GDXU and the bearish GDXD are expected to pack a punch, but that's certainly the case with these products because, on an unleveraged basis, miners are typically volatile bets. GDX has a three-year standard deviation of 33.23%, well above that of broader equity benchmarks and standard industry funds. The small-cap GDXJ has a three-year standard deviation of 38.68%, making it far more volatile than any traditional small-cap benchmark and confirming the MicroSectors ETNs could thrive when action heats up in the miners complex. With the debuts of GDXU and GDXD, MicroSectors offers over 21 ETNs, spanning FANG stocks, big banks, the energy sector, and the first leveraged cannabis products to list in the U.S."
2021-07-20,Unusual Options Activity Insight: VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF,"VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) shares experienced unusual options activity on Tuesday. The stock price moved up to $43.41 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-09-17 Strike Price: $43.00 Volume: 441 Open Interest: 77 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2022-04-12,Economic War Against A Real Economy: How the West May Have Underestimated Russia,"The War In Ukraine: Atoms Versus Bits Judging by the coverage in most of the Western media, Russia is getting soundly beaten in its war with Ukraine. That may be an artifact of the West's (and Ukraine's) superiority at electronic media. The Ukrainian President, Vladimir Zelensky, is, after all, a former television star and producer, who understands media well. And Western media are full of stories of plucky Ukrainian defenders defeating bumbling Russian invaders, such as this article from the Financial Times. Great reportage: how Ukraine inflicted a stinging defeat on Russian forces at the Battle of Kyiv https://t.co/aRNhDenRx9 — Lionel Barber (@lionelbarber) April 11, 2022 Some military experts, such as retired U.S. Army Colonel Douglas Macgregor, say that the Russian army never intended to take Kiev, that its forces deployed in the vicinity of Kiev were merely meant to tie down Ukrainian forces. But those experts have been losing the media war along with Russia. So much for the media (bits). What about the physical world (atoms)? There, the picture looks starkly different. According to the data above, Ukraine has lost 91% of its tanks since Russia invaded, while Russia has lost 6.9% of its tanks. A Similar Dynamic At Work In The Economic War A similar dynamic may be at work in the West's economic war against Russia. Over the weekend, the Financial Times expressed incredulity that contrarian fund manager Dave Iben hadn't written down his position in Gazprom--which has shipped record amounts of gas to Europe throughout the war--to zero. Contrarian fund manager cautions against writing off Russia assets https://t.co/z4Cm226dxq — Financial Times (@FT) April 10, 2022 Similarly, President Biden quipped after levying unprecedented sanctions on Russia that the ruble was now rubble, but Russia's currency has already recovered to pre-war levels. It appears that the laptop class in the West has underestimated the resilience and size of Russia's economy because it's more based on the physical world than ours is. That observation was fleshed out by French economist Jacques Sapir, as Arnaud Bertrand shared in the Twitter thread below. Contrarian fund manager cautions against writing off Russia assets https://t.co/z4Cm226dxq — Financial Times (@FT) April 10, 2022 However this is the worst possible way of comparing the size of economies. A slightly more accurate way is to adjust for PPP (purchasing power parity: https://t.co/SmlsvzplMB) When you do so, you already realize that Russia's economy is actually more like the size of Germany's. — Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) April 10, 2022 He says that when you adjust for this Russia's economy is vastly bigger than Germany's. His estimate is that Russia represents in fact maybe 5% or 6% of the world's economy, almost double the size it's normally estimated at on a PPP basis (https://t.co/I0WHghMEk3) — Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) April 10, 2022 This is a fascinating way to look at it and it rings very true. This crisis is making us realize that we used to take manufacturing, the industry and commodities for granted, i.e. an antiquated side of the economy compared to shiny new services. — Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) April 10, 2022 Bertrand then extends this analysis to China and America. It's also very interesting to revalue China's economy through that lens. If we look at the Chinese economy simply based on exchange rates, it is a $17.7 trillion economy to the U.S.'s $23 trillion. — Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) April 10, 2022 All in all, this means that China and Russia's economies combined are in fact likely about 35% of the world's economy when taking PPP into account as well as compensating for the over-valuation of the service sector. — Arnaud Bertrand (@RnaudBertrand) April 10, 2022 Focusing On The Physical If you look at our top names from Friday, our system is not taking the physical world, and the economy based on it, for granted.

2022-09-14,The VanEck Junior Miners Index: What It Consists Of And Why It's Interesting Now,"The VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) consisting of mostly medium to smallish precious metals companies. For investors looking to diversify broadly in that sector, it’s quite interesting. Some of the components include Yamana Gold Inc. (NYSE:AUY) with 5.97% of the fund, Kinross Gold Corp. (NYSE:KGC) with 5.74% and Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE:PAAS) with 4.57% – he best known of the miners represented. Among the lesser-known names are smaller outfits such as Endeavour Mining PLC (OTC:EDVMF) with 4.05%, B2Gold Corp. (NYSE:BTG) with 3.95% and Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI) with 3.54%. As of Sept. 7, the fund held 100 positions with most of the rest of the components representing small and very small operations, all of which are publicly traded. The idea here is that investors gain broad ownership of many different medium and small mining operations so that diversification beyond the huge miners – Newmont Corp. (NYSE:NEM) and Barrick Gold Corp. (NYSE:GOLD), for example – is achieved. See also: How to Invest in Gold in 2022 For investors concerned with the possibility of increased inflation, it’s a fascinating concept. Here’s the daily price chart: Note the positive divergences appearing on the relative strength indicator (RSI) and on the moving average convergence/divergence indicator (MACD), both below the price chart. There is less downward pressure each time this fund hits a new low, which is the significance of the divergences. This kind of look can mean that selling is drying up and giving way to buying. Here’s the daily price chart for the largest holding, Yamana Gold: Notice how the MACD is trending higher as the September low barely takes out the early July low. The RSI is not showing it yet, but it may be early for this position. Note that the early January 2022 are holding thus far. This is the daily price chart for the second-largest holding, Kinross Gold: This is a clear example of the steadily rising RSI and MACD indicators showing positive divergences to the price action. Note that the September low remains (so far) above the mid-July low. Kinross is adding a 3.48% dividend to the fund as a bonus. And here’s the price chart for the third-largest component, Pan American Silver: This one adds excellent exposure to the silver mining market. The look here is more dramatic with the fall from the April high to the recent low. Nonetheless, the moving average convergence/divergence indicator is suggesting a slowing of selling momentum. The RSI doesn’t yet agree. For diversification into medium to smaller miners, as a hedge for fear of greater inflation, VanEck may be worth a look. Related: How Much is a Gold Bar Worth?

2023-03-17,"Gold Rallies Eyeing $2,000/oz As Recession Looms – These 3 ETFs To Gain From Precious Metal's Bull Wave","Gold has had a textbook rally following the tumultuous week in the U.S. banking sector and heavy drops in Fed hike expectations as recession risks loom. On Friday, gold surged 2% beyond $1,950/oz levels, putting it on track for a 6% weekly gain, its largest since early November 2022. The precious metal is regarded as the premier safe haven asset in this current market climate since it does not carry any default concerns, has continuously maintained its value through periods of persistent inflation, and generally climbs during times of economic slowdown and recession. Next: 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' Author Says You Should Invest In These Two Assets Amid Silicon Valley Bank's Collapse Gold is very sensitive to rate movements because higher interest rates raise the opportunity cost of investing in non-yielding assets like gold, and vice versa. A weaker dollar, lower Treasury yields, and a collapse in expectations for the Fed's rate hikes are all contributing to gold's bullish momentum. Fed swaps now price in a 19 basis point hike in March, with the terminal rate forecast to reach 4.9% in May and then fall from there. Overall, there are three 25-basis-point rate cuts priced until December 2023. Short-term two-year Treasury yields fell by more than 40 basis points this week, the largest drop since October 1987's Black Monday. Gold technical analysis: Bull flag pattern in place Gold price daily timeframe – Chart: TradingView Gold prices broke through a multi-resistance zone this week, which included the 50-day moving average, the psychological $1,900/oz level, and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the high-to-low range from 2022. After the breakout of the flag channel, we can observe the emergence of a bullish flag pattern on the price chart, which may presage an extension of the current rally. The next resistance level is between 1,975 and 1,980, which corresponds to the 2023 price high as well as the 78.6% Fibonacci level. Breaking through this barrier will boost the bull's momentum and improve the chances of an assault on the psychological 2,000 mark. 3 Gold ETFs to Watch: GLD, GDX, GDXJ SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD), VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) and Junior Gold Miners VanEck Vectors ETF (NYSE:GDX) GDXJ are three ETFs to watch for investors looking to profit on gold's rally. 1) GLD SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE:GLD) is an exchange-traded fund managed by World Gold Trust Services, LLC that invests in gold bullions and is linked to physical gold performance. As a result, its price moves in lockstep with the commodity, and it does not pay dividends. GLD saw its highest weekly net inflow in almost a year in the week ended March 16, totalling $709.5 million. GLD price chart and weekly ETF flows – Chart: Koyfin 2) GDX The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in the stocks of companies in the gold mining industry. It tracks the NYSE Arca Gold Miners Index's performance through a complete replication. Dividends are paid once a year, and the current dividend yield is 1.6%. GDX's major holdings include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corporation (NYSE:GOLD), Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV), Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:EAM). In the week ending March 16, GDX received $52 million in weekly net inflows, after around $240 million in outflows the previous week. GDX price chart and weekly ETF flows – Chart: Koyfin 3) GDXJ The VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (NYSE:GDX) is an exchange-traded fund that invests in stocks of companies involved in the gold mining industry. Differently from GDX, the majority of these companies are still in the development and exploratory phases and are seeking for land with a high potential for significant mineral deposits. Junior gold miners are thus more volatile than already productive gold miners, which is why GDXJ has a greater volatility than GDX. GDXJ's top holdings include Kinross Gold Corporation (NYSE:KGC), Yamana Gold Inc. (NYSE:AUY), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI), and Pan American Silver Corp. (NYSE:PAAS). The last week's ETF flow data is missing, but GDXJ had $24 million in outflows in the week ending March 9.

2023-06-09,Why Are Precious Metals Miners Rallying? 5 Mining Stocks To Watch,"Shares of precious metals miners rallied on Thursday, with the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) tracking the industry posting a 1.2% rise for the session and several mining stocks reporting solid gains. Thursday’s unexpected surge in unemployment claims, sparked fears about a weakening labor market and triggered positive reactions for gold and silver mining companies. According to the latest CME Group Fed Watch tool, investors have placed their bets on the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates unchanged next week, assigning a nearly 75% probability. Both the dollar and U.S. Treasury yields fell for the session, while precious metals rose, as the risk of an additional hike faded, at least for now. Gold, tracked by the SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD), gained 1.3%, while silver, tracked by the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV), climbed 3.7%.

2023-07-24,Unlocking Gold Mining's Supercycle: Insights From Benzinga's Virtual Conference,"In the latest virtual conference presented by Benzinga, three outstanding experts and industry professionals gathered to explore the prospects of a new “Supercycle” for gold miners. Delving into crucial factors affecting the performance of gold mining stocks, they discussed Fed interest rates, market valuations, geopolitics, ESG and technological innovation in the industry. In the first part, Imaru Casanova, a portfolio manager for Gold and Precious Metals at VanEck, highlighted the potential bullish catalysts for gold miners and presented her top stock recommendations. Taylor McKenna, CFA and an analyst at Kopernik Global Investors, emphasized the value of gold mining stocks and discussed the application of AI technologies. Luke Norman, co-founder and executive chairman at US Gold Corp. (NYSE:USAU), offered insights into the gold mining exploration side and the permitting cycle. VanEck Sees Attractive Valuations In The Gold Mining Industry VanEck’s Casanova expressed optimism about the outlook for gold miners, citing the end of the Fed tightening cycle as a potential bullish catalyst. With strong global support in the current environment, gold miners are poised to demonstrate their leverage with higher gold prices. Casanova highlighted the historically low multiples at which gold mining stocks are currently trading, coupled with controlled balance sheet costs, generate an attractive investment opportunity. “When gold traded at these levels (around $1,970) in the past, stocks in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) or VanEck Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDXJ) index were trading 15-20% higher,” Casanova said. Regarding top stock recommendations, Casanova identified Endeavor Mining PLC (OTCPK: EDVMF), Alamos Gold Inc. (NYSE:AGI), and Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd (NYSE:AEM). She emphasized that VanEck’s current price forecast for gold is $2,075 per ounce in the next 12 months, which offers a compelling case for diversification and growth in the gold mining sector. Read Also: Agnico Eagle Mines’ Debt Overview Kopernik Global Investors Is Bullish On Smaller Miners Kopernik Global Investors’ McKenna expressed strong conviction in gold mining, pointing out the attractive valuations the sector offers. McKenna discussed the opportunity in smaller companies within the industry such as Seabridge Gold Inc. (NYSE:SA), International Tower Hill Mines Ltd. (NYSE:THM), and Western Copper and Gold Corp. (NYSE:WRN), which trade at even cheaper valuations than big miners but carry higher risk. Among the majors he highlighted is Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD) offers attractive valuations as it shows an all-in-sustaining cost (AISC) of $1,400 an ounce, positioning the company for significant potential if gold prices continue to rise. McKenna also stressed the importance of scrutinizing management teams and incentives, and he shared insights into how AI technologies, such as driverless trucks for mining, are being employed to boost productivity and reduce environmental impact. US Gold Corp’s Vision for the Greenest Mine in North America US Gold Corp.’s Norman shed light on the gold mining exploration and permitting cycle. He emphasized that smaller companies involved in gold exploration often become investment vehicles for larger corporations in the sector. Norman provided an overview of US Gold Corp.’s primary project, the CK Gold project, and its location just outside Cheyenne, Wyoming. “Navigating the permitting process in North America can be challenging, with federal agencies causing bottlenecks,” Norman said. Norman did highlight the advantage of working with the state of Wyoming, which has set a mandate for a more streamlined permitting timeline. Despite trading at a significant market discount due to perceived permitting challenges, US Gold Corp. has 1.5 million ounces of reserves in the ground, and its all-in-sustaining costs are projected at $800 per ounce. Norman believed the in-situ value of reserves in the ground should place U.S. Gold Corp’s market cap to about $300 million, while the company is currently trading at about $40 million market cap. Norman highlighted how ESG became a hugely important factor in the business and he aspired to develop the greenest mine in North America.

2023-08-04,Investors Cheer Jobs Report: Why Are These 5 Stocks And 5 ETFs Shining On Friday?,"The July jobs report issued Friday delivered mixed takeaways for the market, although it confirmed an overall healthy U.S. labor market. On one hand, the pace of nonfarm payrolls growth fell short of forecasts in July, with 187,000 jobs gained compared to the expected 200,000. On the other hand, the jobless rate fell to 3.5%, exceeding expectations of 3.6%. Wages increased at a monthly pace of 0.4% and an annual rate of 4.4%, which was faster than expected. Biden, Fed Governor On July’s Jobs Report The market interpreted the jobs report in a dovish manner, lowering expectations for potential interest rate hikes in September. Market-derived probabilities put the chance of a 25-basis-point hike in September at 13%, down from 19% before the report was issued Friday morning. President Joe Biden applauded the job market data, emphasizing that the share of working-age Americans with jobs has reached a 20-year high. He attributes this positive trend to the effects of his economic policies, often referred to as “Bidenomics.” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said the Fed is likely to remain into restrictive territory well into 2024 and said he is unsurprised wages remain strong. Five stocks from the Russell 1000 index (large-cap) and five exchange-traded funds had substantial price action in the opening minutes of trading Friday as a result of jobs data and the movement in interest rates, as well as statements regarding quarterly corporate results.

2023-10-18,Gold Miners Positioned For Upswing: Keep An Eye On This Leading Economic Indicator,"A fundamental gauge in the world of finance and economics has just provided a signal not to be underestimated. We are talking about the gold-to-copper ratio, which can offer valuable insights into the overall health of the global economy and financial markets. This ratio represents the strength of a safe-haven asset, such as gold, which tends to rise during periods of market and economic turmoil, in comparison to copper, often considered a barometer for industrial production and seen as the driving force behind global economic growth. In practice, it indicates how many pounds of copper one ounce of gold can purchase. As highlighted by SentimenTrader on social media platform X, the “copper-to-gold ratio has recently crossed a crucial threshold, signaling positive prospects for metals and mining.” When examining the chart, this indicator surpassed the value of 544 on Wednesday, reaching its highest level since the end of May 2023. The ratio is now approaching a significant resistance zone, marked by a triple-top pattern that occurred in December 2020, July 2022, and May 2023. Why Is Gold Rising? The conflict in the Middle East has so far benefited two commodities: gold and oil. While the increase in oil prices is primarily due to rising geopolitical and supply risks in the region, what has garnered more attention in recent weeks is the surge in gold prices. This is because not only has the price of gold risen by 6% since Hamas carried out terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, but it has also done so while Treasury yields and the dollar were on the rise, breaking its usual negative correlation with these variables. According to Otavio Costa, a partner and macro strategist at Crescat Capital, gold appears to be on a path toward reaching $2,000 per ounce again, indicating the potential for a significant breakout that could mark the beginning of another long-term cycle. Costa referenced a statement made by Ray Dalio: “If you don’t own gold, you know neither history nor economics.” Gold approaching $2,000/oz again, now poised for a historical break out that could mark the beginning of another long-term cycle.Ray Dalio put it succinctly:If you don't own gold, you know neither history nor economics pic.twitter.com/FZSBCo7FZm— Otavio (Tavi) Costa (@TaviCosta) October 18, 2023 Gold Miners Outperformed Gold miners have emerged as the top-performing industry in October.
