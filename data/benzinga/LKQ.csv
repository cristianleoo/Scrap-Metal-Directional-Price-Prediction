2013-05-08,Stock Market Fake-Out: Where Is the Retrenchment?,"This is unbelievable. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) jumped about 23% since the beginning of the year, not including its dividend payment. This upside on the stock market from such a mature brand is striking. And here’s the thing: the company actually delivered with its earnings results. Companies like PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE: PEP), Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: KRFT), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE: CL), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE/DIS), and even McDonalds Corporation (NYSE: MCD) performed similarly. I can’t recall a time of such coordinated stock market strength from blue chips. Of course, the stock market breakout has been all about the safest names. Institutional investors wanted to buy this market, but they needed the earnings safety to do it. Over the last two weeks, the NASDAQ Composite saw a turnaround from its little slump, based on good earnings news. This broadening of the stock market breakout is definitely necessary for price strength to continue. Oddly, there hasn’t been a correction yet. Quite often on Wall Street, when you get groupthink or a group expectation about an event taking place in the financial markets, it doesn’t happen. There has been no correction so far, and this is truly amazing. Without question, an abundance of caution is appropriate considering where the stock market just came from. First-quarter earnings season is winding down, and a lot of smaller companies are reporting now. Companies like LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ: LKQ), Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALK), Qlik Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: QLIK), Global Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: GMED) and NeuStar, Inc. (NYSE: NSR) reported improved earnings results. (See “Old Economy Auto Parts Stock a Better Play Than Any Tech Stock?”) I consider the stock market’s trading action and investor sentiment as strong enough to carry this market a little higher. But I just don’t see how the stock market can advance meaningfully higher in the face of mediocre economic news. While earnings did show improvement in the first quarter, sales were flat. Clearly, the appetite that institutional investors have to be buyers in this market has some staying power. While corporations were once again cautious with their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, I read many outlooks that were generally positive, expecting economic improvement. Institutional investors must be taking this to heart, and they are buying. Also helping the cause is the enormous cash hoard that continues. Corporate balance sheets, especially among blue chips, are getting stronger. I look at the performance of the stock market with continued amazement. With the Dow Jones industrials up around 14% year-to-date, it is a breakout. Making the case for buying blue chips now is tough, although decent second-quarter earnings can move them higher. I keep waiting for the correction. I’m not rooting for losses, but it is a requirement for the medium-term health of this market. If there isn’t a correction, this unbelievable action will bust."

2014-03-13,Updated Report on Genuine Parts - Analyst Blog,"On Mar 12, 2014, we issued an updated research report on Genuine Parts Company (NYSE: GPC). The company has positive factors like improving earnings, rising cash flow, benefits from acquisitions and efficient capital deployment. However, headwinds include sluggish demand in the Industrial and Office Products segments, rising competition and uncertainty in the macro environment. Genuine Parts Company's earnings per share increased 4.3% year over year to 97 cents in the fourth quarter of 2013 from 93 cents reported in the year-ago quarter (including a one-time pension gain of 10 cents per share). Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents per share. Revenues in the quarter grew 12.8% to $3.5 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The year-over-year improvement in revenues can be attributed to benefits from acquisitions, partially offset by headwinds from currency translations. Genuine Parts has undertaken various initiatives to boost sales and earnings, such as, product line expansion, penetration into new markets and cost-saving activities. The company relies on a diverse product portfolio for top- and bottom-line growth. However, weak customer demand in the equipment and machinery business offset the growth in food products, automotive, pulp and paper as well as lumber and wood products businesses in the Industrial segment. Demand in the Office Products segment fell in 2013 due to high unemployment and increasing digitization of offices, which reduced demand for paper-based office products. Genuine Parts reported positive earnings surprises in two of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 1.61%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the company's 2014 earnings is $4.57 per share, up 3.78% over 2013. Genuine Parts Company is a prominent player in the automotive replacement parts industry with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks worth considering in the automotive replacement industry are Remy International, Inc. (REMY), Motorcar Parts of America Inc. (NASDAQ: MPAA) and LKQ Corp. (NASDAQ: LKQ). Remy and Motorcar Parts sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while LKQ carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2015-08-19,A Used-Car Portfolio To Profit From A Sluggish Economy,"Motif Investing constantly looks for “trends, ideas and world events that could create an investment opportunity,” and then picks 10 to 30 related stocks to build portfolios around, weighing them based on their exposure to the coinciding idea, event or trend. One of the motifs that has been delivering a strong performance, both over the past month and past year, is the Used Car Tune-up portfolio, which provides exposure to companies that profit from increased use of old cars. Below is a closer look at this motif, which has returned 31.3 percent over the past year and 6 percent in the past month, comfortably outperforming the S&P 500. Source: MotifInvesting Making Do With More Mileage The people behind this motif explain why they thought of it. According to the site, the recession led to reduced consumer spending and made credit harder to obtain. Consequently, new-car sales fell, boosting the average age of cars in the U.S. The figure hit a record 11.4 years in 2012.

That increased sales of pre-owned vehicles by 4.4 percent from 2011 to 2012, while the average price of a used car (up to eight years old) increased 1.2 percent. All of which revs the engines of car dealers, who earn higher margins on used car sales vs. new cars.” Allocation So, without further ado, let’s look into the asset allocation of this motif. 65.4 percent of assets are allocated to auto parts retailers stocks 13.9 percent to diversified auto parts stocks – mainly producers 13.5 percent to car dealers 7.1 percent to tires manufacturers The top stock picks in terms of allocation are: AutoZone, Inc.

2015-12-22,LKQ to Acquire Rhiag-Inter Auto Parts Italia S.p.A. for Enterprise Value of €1.04B,"LKQ Corporation (Nasdaq: LKQ) announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire the holding company of Rhiag-Inter Auto Parts Italia S.p.A (Rhiag), a leading pan-European business-to-business distributor of aftermarket spare parts for passenger cars and commercial vehicles, for an enterprise value of €1.04 billion. Rhiag has operations in Italy, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Hungary, Romania, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Poland and Spain. Rhiag operates through 247 distribution centers and 10 warehouses, and serves more than 100,000 professional clients. The transaction is expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2016 and is subject to customary closing conditions and necessary regulatory approvals. Rhiag expands our addressable market with the addition of 10 new countries to our European footprint, stated Robert L. Wagman, President and Chief Executive Officer of LKQ Corporation. Rhiag has a strong market position in Italy and the Czech Republic and experienced management teams in their respective markets. Clearly this acquisition will accelerate our strategy of creating a Pan-European aftermarket mechanical parts distribution business in this highly-fragmented €188 billion wholesale DIFM market. Luca Zacchetti, Rhiag Group CEO, commented: I believe that, combined with LKQ, Rhiag Group will be in an even stronger position to deliver its superior service level to customers across Europe. I am committed to pursuing our existing strategic goal of profitable market share growth. Rhiag`s revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately €882 million, and LKQ expects the transaction to be accretive to its earnings in 2016. These projected results exclude restructuring and acquisition related expenses. The Company intends to initially finance the acquisition with borrowings on its revolving credit facility and the assumption of Rhiag`s indebtedness. As of September 30, 2015, the Company had approximately $1.3 billion of available borrowing capacity on its credit facility. LKQ Corporation Board member and Euro Car Parts Chairman Sukhpal Singh Ahluwalia added I have long admired Rhiag`s impressive track record of growth and strong distribution network. We have numerous common suppliers, and I have worked closely with many of them for more than 30 years. I am confident that together with Rhiag we will make our supplier relationships even stronger. LKQ and Rhiag share a commitment to serve our customers and a desire to expand into new markets. I look forward to welcoming the Rhiag team to the LKQ Europe family in a few months. Rhiag is an example of a high quality, market-leading distributor, said Frank Ehmer of Apax Partners LLP. I would like to thank Luca Zacchetti and the management team for delivering outstanding results across the business during our stewardship of the firm. The team achieved success on a number of organic growth initiatives as well as successfully executed on an M&A strategy. We believe the company is well-positioned to achieve success under LKQ ownership. BofA Merrill Lynch acted as exclusive financial advisor to LKQ Corporation in connection with this transaction. JP Morgan and UBS acted as financial advisors to Apax Partners and Rhiag Group."

2016-06-27,LKQ Corporation May See Its Profits Reduced Due To Brexit,"The currency headwinds from Brexit could lower the profits of LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ: LKQ) by 2-3 percent annually, according to a note from Baird. LKQ, a distributor of vehicle aftermarket parts, generates about 15 percent of pro forma revenue in the UK and approximately 33 percent in Europe (including the UK). We believe LKQ guidance is based on a $1.45/£1 and $1.10/€1. Currently, the $/£ rate is closer to $1.37 and €/$ is closer to $1.11. Also, based on our notes, we believe LKQ purchases roughly half of its UK inventory in GBP, analyst Craig Kennison wrote in a note. With six months to go in 2016 and assuming exchange rates near current levels, the analyst said the event could cut his $1.79 2016 EPS estimate by $0.02-$0.03 on a preliminary basis. Based on similar assumptions for 2017, the Brexit vote could reduce the analyst's $2.09 2017 EPS estimate by $0.03-$0.06. However, Kennison has an Outperform rating and $36 price target on the stock, saying that the company is benefiting from a secular trend favoring alternative-to-OEM parts. At time of writing, shares of LKQ fell 5.12 percent to $29.45."

2018-05-30,"Down 26% In 2018, LKQ Is Far From 'Totaled,' Says Bullish SunTrust Analyst","Auto parts distributor LKQ Corporation (NYSE:LKQ)'s stock fell 26 percent in 2018, but investors who think the stock is totaled may want to reconsider, according to SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. The Analyst Analyst Stephanie Benjamin initiated coverage of LKQ's stock with a Buy rating and $40 price target. The Thesis Shares of LKQ plummeted 20 percent in reaction to first-quarter results that included an EPS miss and a reduction in full-year guidance. Any issues seen in the quarter are transitional rather than structural, Benjamin said in the initiation note. LKQ saw temporary issues at its new UK warehouse as the company shifted from three smaller legacy warehouses to a new, fully automated facility that was unable to immediately handle a full capacity, the analyst said. The state-of-the-art facility is under control and any near-term sales disruption has been since fully rectified, Benjamin said. While it will take a few more quarters before the new facility has worked out all inefficiencies, there is little doubt the company will exit 2018 without remaining production issues, the analyst said. The 26-percent selloff in LKQ's stock since the turn of the year is unwarranted, Benjamin said, adding that the weakness represents a great opportunity for a company with a long runway to post at least a mid-single digit organic growth rate and a notable scale advantage in both the U.S. and Europe. Price Action LKQ shares were up 2.52 percent at the time of publication Wednesday afternoon.

Cramer likes Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX). Iridium Communications Inc (NASDAQ:IRDM) is a buy because it's a unique, niche business, said Cramer. Cramer isn't a buyer of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated (NASDAQ:HBAN). He doesn't like the regional banks at the moment. In the banking sector, he likes Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM). Cramer thinks Randgold Resources Ltd. (NASDAQ:GOLD) should be bought because people should have some gold exposure as an insurance. He isn't a big gold bull at the moment. LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) isn't working, said Cramer. He misjudged how bad the auto cycle was and he made a bad decision to recommend the stock. PPL Corp (NYSE:PPL) is a fine utility and it does the job, said Cramer."

2019-11-13,10 S&P 500 Stocks With The Most Institutional Buying,"Large institutional investors, such as mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, endowments and other investment firms, are often considered to be the “smart money” on Wall Street. Unlike the average retail investor, many of these professionals have industry connections, top-tier resources and huge teams of professionals to perform analysis and develop strategies. While institutions are far from perfect in picking stocks, traders and investors often see a stock’s institutional ownership as a vote of confidence from Wall Street. When a new institution takes a large stake in a company, it can serve as a major bullish catalyst. At the same time, a stock with relatively low institutional ownership may be a red flag. Why Is It Important? Typically, institutional investors don’t tend to trade their positions in the short-term given their large size and the costs and difficulties in finding buyers and sellers. In addition, all institutional investors are not created equal. Some fund managers have reputations as being momentum investors, whereas others are known for value or contrarian investing strategies. Typically, institutional ownership is considered a good thing, but retail investors should understand what they are getting into when they buy a stock with high institutional ownership. Institutions often own millions or billions of dollars worth of stock, so even a single institutional investor can flood the market with shares and drive down the stock price if it exits a large enough position. In addition, large institutional investors can exert pressure on a company’s management them given the voting power their shares hold. Sometimes this influence can be bullish, and other times it can hold a company back and create an unwanted distraction. Stocks Institutions Are Buying Here are the 10 stocks in the S&P 500 that have experienced the most institutional buying, according to Finviz. Stocks are sorted by the percent change in total institutional ownership. Fiserv Inc (NASDAQ:FISV), +28.1% ownership. Fidelity National Information Servcs Inc (NYSE:FIS), +14.2% ownership.

Benzinga’s Take It’s always good to see institutions betting on a stock in your portfolio, but it is especially telling to see institutions buying the dip in underperforming stocks like Macerich and Macy’s. If company insiders and institutions see a sell-off as an investing opportunity, investors can rest assured that the bull thesis for a stock is alive and well. Do you agree with this take?

2019-11-26,15 Highest-Rated Analyst Stock Picks In The S&P 500,"Wall Street analysts take a lot of heat when they get stock picks wrong, but nobody is perfect at predicting the market. Analysts typically have access to industry insiders, cutting edge technology and a tremendous amount of resources that are useful in picking winners and losers in the market. Many analysts also have years of experience on Wall Street. While those advantages certainly don’t make analysts infallible, analyst commentary is a valuable resource for investors. Consensus Opinion To avoid the pitfalls of a bad analyst call, investors should take a broad look at the ratings and price targets of all the analysts covering a particular stock rather than relying strictly on the opinion of one analyst. The consensus analyst view is definitely wrong sometimes, but knowing that a stock has passed the scrutiny of a dozen or more analysts without any major red flags is always a bullish sign. For individual analyst calls, investors can use TipRanks to take a look at an analysts track record. But remember that an analyst with a history of good calls may simply cover a hot sector of the market, such as technology. Top Stock Picks Here’s a look at the 15 S&P 500 stocks with the most bullish consensus analyst ratings according to Finviz. The overall rating score is based on an average analyst rating on a scale of 1.0 (Strong Buy) to 5.0 (Strong Sell). Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX), 1.4 rating. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), 1.6 rating. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), 1.6 rating. Jacobs Engineering Group Inc (NYSE:JEC), 1.6 rating. Keysight Technologies Inc (NYSE:KEYS), 1.6 rating. LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ), 1.6 rating. Marathon Petroleum Corp (NYSE:MPC), 1.6 rating. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), 1.6 rating. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH), 1.6 rating. Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS), 1.6 rating. NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE), 1.7 rating. NRG Energy Inc (NYSE:NRG), 1.7 rating. Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA), 1.7 rating. Lamb Weston Holdings Inc (NYSE:LW), 1.7 rating. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), 1.7 rating. Benzinga’s Take While analyst ratings can be a useful tool on a relative basis, they are skewed extremely heavily toward the bullish end of the spectrum. Even during previous market crashes, analysts have rated at least 90% of stocks they cover as Buy or Hold, while the percentage of Sell ratings is around 6%. Do you agree with this take?

2019-12-17,LKQ Has Large Option Traders' Attention After Big 2019 Run,"LKQ Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) is up 52.8% year to date despite a difficult global auto market. On Tuesday, LKQ had the attention of several large option traders, but the action wasn’t clearly bullish or bearish in nature. The Trades Benzinga Pro subscribers received three option alerts related to unusually large trades of LKQ options: At 10:19 a.m., a trader bought 753 LKQ call options with a $37.50 strike price expiring on Feb. 21 near the ask price at 70.1 cents. The trade represented a $52,785 bullish bet. At 11:08 a.m., a trader sold 500 LKQ call options with a $37.50 strike price expiring on Feb, 21 near the bid price at 70.5 cents. The trade represented an $32,250 bearish bet. At 11:19 a.m., another trade of 500 LKQ call options with a $37.50 strike price expiring on Feb. 21 was executed near the spread midpoint at 72.5 cents. The trade represented a $36,250 neutral bet. All together, the three trades represented a net bearish bet of around $20,535. Why It's Important Even traders who stick exclusively to stocks often monitor option market activity closely for unusually large trades. Given the relative complexity of the options market, large options traders are typically considered to be more sophisticated than the average stock trader. Many of these large options traders are wealthy individuals or institutions who may have unique information or theses related to the underlying stock. Unfortunately, stock traders often use the options market to hedge against their larger stock positions, and there’s no surefire way to determine if an options trade is a standalone position or a hedge. In this case, given the relatively small sizes of the LKQ trades on Tuesday morning by institutional standards, they are unlikely to be hedges. 2020 The Year Of Auto Parts? LKQ traders may have mixed feelings heading into 2020 given the stock has outperformed so much in 2019. Some traders are likely looking to take year-end profits on large gains, while others are hoping for more upside ahead next year given bullish recent commentary from Wall Street. CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson recently said he's bullish on LKQ heading into 2020 given its recent balance sheet improvements and its aggressive share buyback program. “We continue to consider LKQ one of the industry’s most attractively-valued names, and buybacks/debt paydown should help support EPS growth despite top-line and margin-related headwinds, noting that LKQ’s average Q3 share count was 3.6% lower than the year-ago quarter,” Nelson said. Bank of America estimates the total number of vehicles on the road that are between six and 10 years old began to rise in 2019 after shrinking for the past decade. However, that number should jump by 11% in 2020, a trend that should benefit auto parts stocks. Benzinga’s Take Between Monday and Tuesday, there were seven total LKQ option alerts related to unusually large trades, but there is clearly no smart money consensus about where LKQ us headed in the next couple of months. Three trades were calls purchased at or near the ask, three were calls sold at or near the bid, and one was a trade at the midpoint. The stock traded around $36.19 per share at time of publication.

2021-02-17,Earnings Outlook for LKQ,"LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) unveils its next round of earnings this Thursday, February 18. Get prepared with Benzinga's ultimate preview for LKQ's Q4 earnings. Net Income, Earnings, And Earnings Per Share Earnings and EPS are useful metrics of profitability. Total earnings also known as net income is equal to total revenue minus total expenses. Dividing net income by the total number of shares outstanding yields EPS. Earnings And Revenue LKQ EPS will likely be near $0.59 while revenue will be around $2.90 billion, according to analysts. In the same quarter last year, LKQ reported earnings per share of $0.54 on sales of $3.01 billion. Why Analyst Estimates And Earnings Surprises Are Important Wall Street analysts who study this company will publish analyst estimates of revenue and EPS. The averages of all analyst EPS and revenue estimates are called the consensus estimates; these consensus estimates can have a significant effect on a company's performance during an earnings release. When a company posts earnings or revenue above or below a consensus estimate, it has posted an earnings surprise, which can really move a stock depending on the difference between actual and estimated values. If the company were to match the consensus estimate when it reports Thursday, earnings would be up 9.26%. Revenue would be down 3.65% from the same quarter last year. Here is how the company's EPS has stacked up against analyst estimates in the past: Quarter Q3 2020 Q2 2020 Q1 2020 Q4 2020 EPS Estimate 0.51 0.15 0.52 0.52 EPS Actual 0.75 0.53 0.57 0.54 Revenue Estimate 2.92 B 2.35 B 3.02 B 3.02 B Revenue Actual 3.05 B 2.63 B 3.00 B 3.01 B Stock Performance For a full 12 months, the return has risen by 8.55%. Given that these returns are generally positive, long-term shareholders are probably relaxed going into this earnings release. Long-term shareholders are already enjoying 12-month gains prior to the announcement. Do not be surprised to see the stock move on comments made during its conference call. LKQ is scheduled to hold the call at 08:00:00 ET and can be accessed here."

2021-02-19,How Does LKQ's Debt Look?,"Shares of LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) moved higher by 4.46% in the past three months. Before having a look at the importance of debt, let us look at how much debt LKQ has. LKQ's Debt Based on LKQ's balance sheet as of November 3, 2020, long-term debt is at $3.01 billion and current debt is at $97.27 million, amounting to $3.11 billion in total debt. Adjusted for $421.38 million in cash-equivalents, the company's net debt is at $2.69 billion. Let's define some of the terms we used in the paragraph above. Current debt is the portion of a company's debt which is due within 1 year, while long-term debt is the portion due in more than 1 year. Cash equivalents include cash and any liquid securities with maturity periods of 90 days or less. Total debt equals current debt plus long-term debt minus cash equivalents. Shareholders look at the debt-ratio to understand how much financial leverage a company has. LKQ has $12.16 billion in total assets, therefore making the debt-ratio 0.26. As a rule of thumb, a debt-ratio more than one indicates that a considerable portion of debt is funded by assets. A higher debt-ratio can also imply that the company might be putting itself at risk for default, if interest rates were to increase. However, debt-ratios vary widely across different industries. A debt ratio of 40% might be higher for one industry and normal for another. Why Shareholders Look At Debt? Debt is an important factor in the capital structure of a company, and can help it attain growth. Debt usually has a relatively lower financing cost than equity, which makes it an attractive option for executives. Interest-payment obligations can impact the cash-flow of the company. Having financial leverage also allows companies to use additional capital for business operations, allowing equity owners to retain excess profit, generated by the debt capital.

2021-07-29,Analyzing LKQ's Unusual Options Activity,"On Thursday, shares of LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved up to $51.17. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-08-20 Strike Price: $52.50 Volume: 1716 Open Interest: 4851 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another indicator of unusual options activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Additional time until a contract expires generally increases the potential for it to grow its time value and reach its strike price. It is important to consider time value because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2022-03-14,This Foreboding Sign Looms Over LKQ's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be trouble ahead for shares of LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ). A so-called death cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bearish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The death cross occurs when the 50-day moves below the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with LKQ, which is trading around $45.83 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Death Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for short positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible short positions. With that in mind, take a look at LKQ's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q4 2021 Q3 2021 Q2 2021 Q1 2021 EPS Estimate 0.77 0.86 0.75 0.63 EPS Actual 0.87 1.02 1.13 0.94 Revenue Estimate 3.09B 3.28B 3.08B 2.96B Revenue Actual 3.19B 3.30B 3.44B 3.17B Do you use the Death Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2022-08-25,This Favorable Sign Appears On LKQ's Chart,"If history is any guide, there may be good fortune ahead for shares of LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ). A so-called golden cross has formed on its chart and, not surprisingly, this could be bullish for the stock. What To Know: Many traders use moving average crossover systems to make their decisions. When a shorter-term average price crosses above a longer-term average price, it could mean the stock is trending higher. If the short-term average price crosses below the long-term average price, it means the trend is lower. Why It's Important: The 50-day and the 200-day simple moving averages are commonly used. The golden cross occurs when the 50-day crosses above the 200-day. This could mean the long-term trend is changing. That just happened with LKQ, which is trading around $55.31 at publication time. Remember: Seasoned investors don't blindly trade Golden Crosses. Instead, they use it as a signal to start looking for long positions based on other factors, like price levels and company fundamentals & events. For seasoned investors, this is just a sign that it might be time to start considering possible long positions. With that in mind, take a look at LKQ's past and upcoming earnings expectations: Quarter Q2 2022 Q1 2022 Q4 2021 Q3 2021 EPS Estimate 1.02 0.92 0.77 0.86 EPS Actual 1.09 1 0.87 1.02 Revenue Estimate 3.45B 3.30B 3.09B 3.28B Revenue Actual 3.34B 3.35B 3.19B 3.30B Do you use the Golden Cross signal in your trading or investing?

2022-09-08,Is First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX ETF (FEX) a Strong ETF Right Now?,"Making its debut on 05/08/2007, smart beta exchange traded fund First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX ETF (ETF:FEX) provides investors broad exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend category of the market. What Are Smart Beta ETFs? The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market. Market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns, and are a good option for investors who believe in market efficiency. But, there are some investors who would rather invest in smart beta funds; these funds track non-cap weighted strategies, and are a strong option for those who prefer choosing great stocks in order to beat the market. Based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such, these indexes attempt to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance. This area offers many different investment choices, such as simplest equal-weighting, fundamental weighting and volatility/momentum based weighting methodologies; however, not all of these strategies can deliver superior results. Fund Sponsor & Index FEX is managed by First Trust Advisors, and this fund has amassed over $1.09 billion, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Style Box - Large Cap Blend. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Core Index. The NASDAQ AlphaDEX Large Cap Core Index is an enhanced index which employs the AlphaDEX stock selection methodology to select stocks from the NASDAQ US 500 Large Cap Index. Cost & Other Expenses Expense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long-term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins, other things remaining the same. Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.59% for FEX, making it on par with most peer products in the space. The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.18%. Sector Exposure and Top Holdings Even though ETFs offer diversified exposure which minimizes single stock risk, it is still important to look into a fund's holdings before investing. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis. FEX's heaviest allocation is in the Financials sector, which is about 17.50% of the portfolio. Its Information Technology and Healthcare round out the top three. When you look at individual holdings, At&t Inc. (NYSE:T) accounts for about 0.58% of the fund's total assets, followed by Lkq Corporation (NASDAQ:LKQ) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD). The top 10 holdings account for about 5.26% of total assets under management. Performance and Risk The ETF has lost about -11.93% and is down about -8.95% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 09/08/2022), respectively. FEX has traded between $74.38 and $92.98 during this last 52-week period. The ETF has a beta of 1.06 and standard deviation of 25.39% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 376 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk. Alternatives First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the Style Box - Large Cap Blend segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider. IShares Core S&P 500 ETF (ETF:IVV) tracks S&P 500 Index and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (ETF:SPY) tracks S&P 500 Index. IShares Core S&P 500 ETF has $297.83 billion in assets, SPDR S&P 500 ETF has $360.82 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%. Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the Style Box - Large Cap Blend.

2022-10-27,LKQ Reports Q3 Revenue Below Street View; Tightens FY22 Forecast,"LKQ Corp (NASDAQ:LKQ) reported a third-quarter FY22 sales decline of 5.9% year-on-year to $3.10 billion, missing the consensus of $3.21 billion. Gross margin for the quarter expanded 30 basis points Y/Y to 41.1%. Operating margin remained flat at 11.5%, and operating income for the quarter declined 5.3% to $358 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.97 was in line with the analyst consensus. LKQ held $269 million in cash and equivalents as of September 30, 2022. The operating cash flow totaled $273 million, with a free cash flow of $224 million. The company's quarterly cash dividend of $0.275 per share is payable on December 1, 2022, to stockholders of record on November 17, 2022. This reflects a 10% increase over the prior quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. On October 25, 2022, the company's Board authorized a $1 billion increase to the existing share repurchase program and extended the duration through 2025. Outlook: LKQ revised the FY22 adjusted EPS outlook to $3.85 - $3.95 from $3.85 - $4.05, against the consensus of $3.93. The company revised the FY22 organic revenue growth outlook for parts and services to 4.75% - 5.75% from 4.5% - 6.5%. Price Action: LKQ shares traded higher by 4.64% at $55.91 on the last check Thursday. Photo Via Company"
2023-01-13,"LKQ Is Becoming An Inflation Hedge, Says Analyst","Raymond James analyst Sam Darkatsh reiterated an Outperform rating on the shares of LKQ Corp (NASDAQ:LKQ) and raised the price target from $60 to $65. The analyst reduced EPS estimates to slightly above consensus levels ahead of LKQ’s February release of Q4 results. The analyst views Q4 North America P&S organic sales as likely still healthy given pricing benefits and likely double-digit Boyd Group comparable sales. While Vehicle Miles Driven / U.S. Gas Consumption have moderated to approximately flat y/y, LKQ comparable structurally benefit from mid-single-digit y/y 4QTD PPI for auto parts manufacturing, improving Taiwanese aftermarket parts availability, and above-market fill rates driven by salvage/recycled inventory, the analyst said. The analyst calculates Q4 gross interest expense closer to $29 million. Given LKQ’s recently amended revolver facility and accounting for current forward rates, the analyst estimates FY23 interest expense of $125 million, versus the Street at $85 million. European FX trends were favorable versus late-October views and prior guidance, added the analyst. Similarly, the analyst’s model is now updated to reflect (minor) sequential changes in steel/precious metals prices. Trimmed estimates notwithstanding, the analyst believes the stock still bullishly implies asymmetrically low assumptions for LT sales growth. LKQ has demonstrated an ability to get price in its core North America P&S business, has retained profits from steel and precious metal inflation to increasingly become a true inflation hedge, said the analyst. However, the above factors, the analyst remarks, may be overshadowed in the short-term by soft U.S. gasoline consumption demand data in the U.S. and geopolitical tensions in Europe. Price Action: LKQ shares are trading higher by 0.19% at $58.11 on the last check Friday."

2023-02-24,Looking Into LKQ's Return On Capital Employed,"According to Benzinga Pro, during Q4, LKQ (NASDAQ:LKQ) earned $195.00 million, a 25.57% increase from the preceding quarter. LKQ's sales decreased to $3.00 billion, a 3.32% change since Q3. In Q3, LKQ earned $262.00 million, and total sales reached $3.10 billion. What Is ROCE? Return on Capital Employed is a measure of yearly pre-tax profit relative to capital employed by a business. Changes in earnings and sales indicate shifts in a company's ROCE. A higher ROCE is generally representative of successful growth of a company and is a sign of higher earnings per share in the future. A low or negative ROCE suggests the opposite. In Q4, LKQ posted an ROCE of 0.04%. Keep in mind, while ROCE is a good measure of a company's recent performance, it is not a highly reliable predictor of a company's earnings or sales in the near future. ROCE is a powerful metric for comparing the effectiveness of capital allocation for similar companies. A relatively high ROCE shows LKQ is potentially operating at a higher level of efficiency than other companies in its industry. If the company is generating high profits with its current level of capital, some of that money can be reinvested in more capital which will generally lead to higher returns and, ultimately, earnings per share (EPS) growth.
