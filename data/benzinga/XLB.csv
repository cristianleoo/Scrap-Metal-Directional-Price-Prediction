2009-09-03,August 2009 Rewind - Running On Empty?,"[GRAPHIC FIXED -THANKS!] Equities put in another august performance last month, but in some ways discussed below, the rally started to feel as if it were slowly running out of gas. For August, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and NASDAQ 100 cash indices once again posted positive results of +3.36%, +3.54% and +1.36%, respectively, leaving them all up nicely on the year.While we have certainly seen some more obvious cracks in the market advance in the first days of September, I note below that there were some early warning signs last month in the lagging performance of the leading NASDAQ 100, and an actual negative result in the Small-Cap Growth stocks. So far the retrace has been mild at best. With the majority of earnings now out of the way, the reaction to tomorrow's jobs report may well set the tone for the balance of the month.Sentiment: PositiveVolatility: Narrow (VIX 24-27)Direction: Higher[Click to Enlarge/ Weekly ETF Analyses]The Style-Box was calculated using the following PowerShares™ ETFs: Small-Growth (PWT), Small-Value (PWY), Mid-Growth (PWJ), Mid-Value (PWP), Large-Growth (PWB), and Large-Value (PWV).

2009-10-02,September 2009 Rewind - Back to School for Bears,"Last month I questioned whether equities were Running on Empty, and perhaps I could pose that very same question this early October after a rash of less than stellar economic reports. Nevertheless, September undeniably put in more healthy returns for the year with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and NASDAQ 100 cash indices up +3.57%, +2.27% and +5.77%, respectively.Mid-Caps, Industrials and Technology led the charge, while Health Care and Large-Cap Value stocks lagged somewhat, although clearly all of the tracked indices came out to the positive.

2009-11-03,October 2009 Rewind - A Stop in the Road,"October finally put a halt in the road for equities' historic seven-month run off of the March lows, leaving the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and NASDAQ 100 cash indices mixed at -1.98%, +0.00% and -3.02%, respectively. The month also ended with the VIX back in the low thirties for the first time in a while.With the majority of third quarter earnings entered into the record books, the pullback came on nascent dollar strength, a key rate increase in Australia, higher energy costs and mixed economic reports. Small (IJK) and Mid-Caps (IWS), Financials (XLF) and Materials (XLB) led the retreat, while Energy (XLE) and Consumer Staples (XLP) were able to eek out positive returns. Ten days into the decline, traders in early November will be looking to the FOMC and the monthly jobs report to put the rally back on track.

2010-01-06,December 2009 Rewind - Steady Sleighing,"Short of a sovereign debt downgrade or two, last month provided remarkably steady sleighing as the majority of economic reports continued to come in ahead of expectation. For the month, all tracked indices finished higher with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and NASDAQ 100 cash indices up by +1.78% , +0.80% and +5.26%, respectively.

Watch the UltraShort Financials ProShares ETF (NYSE: SKF) if financials remain under pressure. The Market Vectors Russia ETF (NYSE: RSX) is finding 2010 to be much tougher sledding than 2009 was.

2010-02-08,January 2010 Rewind - Foundational Cracks,"In spite of a relatively decent earnings season, mixed economic readings, domestic political turmoil and an emerging sell-the-news mentality left cracks in the foundation of the ten-month old bear market recovery. This January, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and NASDAQ 100 cash indices finished down across the board by -3.70% , -3.46% and -6.41%, respectively.Although the VIX (implied options volatility) set new post-crash lows, it likewise spiked heavily in the month's fourth week when General Electric (GE) missed earnings expectations and strong opposition was indicated for Federal Reserve Board Chairman Bernanke's renomination.As shown below, Technology (XLK) and Materials (XLB) were the hardest hit by January's reversal of fortune (2009's biggest winners). In fact, only the Health Care (XLH) sector was able to eek out a small gain. With February's trade well underway, it seems clear that last month's poor performance was just the first shot across the bow as volatility remains on the rise while traders ponder the long-term consequences of the swap of private for public debt across the globe.Sentiment: MixedVolatility: Low (VIX 18-27)Direction: Down [Click to Enlarge/ Weekly ETF Analyses/ Prior Monthly Summaries]The Style-Box was calculated using the following PowerShares™ ETFs: Small-Growth (PWT), Small-Value (PWY), Mid-Growth (PWJ), Mid-Value (PWP), Large-Growth (PWB), and Large-Value (PWV).

2010-02-11,"Materials Sector Poised For Upswing (XLB, AA, DOW, MON, FCX)","We have been looking over the sectors analyzing which ones may be the first to move higher if the markets continue upwards. One that interests us is the materials sector. A solid ETF that tracks this sector is the Materials Select Sector SPDR (Nasdaq: XLB). Currently, it is trading at just under $31 per share with a 52-week high of $35.38 per share. Looking at the annotated chart of the Materials SPDR we can see that the technical indicators are showing us strength coming back into the ETF and sector. We are looking for a breakout of the $31 per share price to be a major bullish indicator to the upside. If you are looking for stronger names within the sector that could outperform the sector overall, we like most Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (NYSE: FCX). Freeport-McMoRan has a great fundamental base with large amounts of copper and gold reserves which, although not yet mined, makes it an attractive investment for fund managers. Even better, traders can encompass option strategies because its options are actively traded as well. Currently trading at $73.33, the 52-week high of the stock is $90.55. Another stock that would be worth looking at is Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) as momentum traders like to play this name as well. If the sector does kick to the upside, this name could also spike as well. Monsanto Company is currently trading down -0.35 cents today at $75.22 per share. Its 52 week high is $93.35. The last stock to highlight is Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA) which is currently trading for $13.45 per share. With a beta of 2.19 Alcoa Inc. could also move quite a bit higher if the sector lifts. If you are looking to reduce some risk while limiting upside, you could create a synthetic dividend by selling April-2010 15 strike calls of Alcoa for roughly $0.50 which could help lower your break even stock price to below $13.00 per share over that 64 day period. That would create a maximum profit of roughly over $2 per share over the 64 days until April expiration. This would be a great return on an annual basis."
2010-02-12,"Materials Sector ETF Poised to Fill Gap Down (XLB, GLD)","Just a quick note for traders looking for some gap fill ideas. We are noticing some upward movement in Materials Select SPDR ETF (NYSE: XLB). The names in this sector were strong yesterday so we may see a rebound continue in them after this mornings gap down. This ETF tracks a basket of stocks in the Materials sector and includes names such as Alcoa (NYSE: AA), Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) and Freeport McMoran (NYSE: FCX)."
2010-02-12,"How To Play China's Move (UUP, XLB, VALE, CSCO, FLR)","China took steps to cool its overheated economy this morning by raising reserve requirements for its banks. This is the second time Beijing has announced plans to raise reserve levels. Now that China is taking some of the easy money off the table, what's the trade to profit in this new environment? When monetary policy is tightened by central banks, the dollar often rises (NYSE: UUP), while commodities and materials (NYSE: XLB) suffer. Zach Karabell joined the Fast Money crew on Friday and stated that he doesn't believe these recent events change the fundamental China story. He believes China is a source of enormous economic growth and he wants to buy what China buys as an economy. For longer-term picks, Zach likes Vale (NYSE: VALE), a Brazilian metals and mining company, around $26. He is also bullish on Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) and Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) around $40."

2010-03-08,Materials ETF Sees Bearish Options Trade,"The Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE: XLB) is seeing some bearish options action today as 20,000 of the January 2011 30 puts were purchased. That trade was more than six times open interest in the strike and represents a bet the ETF will trade below $30 by early next year. The trade wasn't tied to another options or stock trade today, so it is likely a straight bearish bet. XLB's top holdings are Monsanto (NYSE: MON) and Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW)."

I know many of you are religious about archiving these -- which is precisely their purpose -- so here it is in shortened form. Early February was all about fear of a sovereign debt domino effect on the prospect of a default by Greece.However, by the end of the month after clean tag of the S&P 500's 200-day ema, a significant snap back rally ensued that has pushed well into mid-March. This move left the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and NASDAQ 100 cash indices higher across the board by +2.85%, +2.56% and +4.46%, respectively. With ramifications of the exchange of private for public debt put on the side for now, equities continue to string together a record ratio of up days.

2010-04-27,I Disagree With William Bernstein,"IndexUniverse posted an interview with William Bernstein who is known for strong beliefs in index investing and has written several books. In there he made two points that I would strenuously disagree with.First he reiterated a point that many indexers make that I think is overly academic as he noted that passive still beats active in the long run because it has to by mathematical certainty. I believe this ignores way too many variables to be useful for most folks.I have heard versions of this argument that focus on management fees (based on the article this was Bernstein's point) and other versions that focus on there only being so much alpha out there.It is not clear to me what Bernstein thinks of as long term but most indexers are talking about market cap weighting. If you recall last summer the ALPS Equal Sector Weight ETF (EQL) came out with a ten year back test of beating the regular cap weighted S&P 500. It should be noted that the ten year period backtested for EQL was probably the best possible time for such a thing because of excess and subsequent fallout of the tech sector and then the financial sector. I would also concede that Bernstein probably thinks long run is longer than ten years and I would not disagree with that but ten years of outperformance is a long time.I believe I have made a reasonably compelling case on this site in the last few years for the importance of correctly avoiding a given sector or country. It does not take a lot of acumen to see that an S&P 500 sector is greater than 20% of that index which is a huge warning sign and easy to heed. Realizing that a country is on shaky ground takes a little more time but most certainly does not require a PHD.Bernstein's point also ignores the fact that active management is a series of decisions; some right and some wrong. In this light success depends on being right a little more often than you are wrong. If the wrongs can be mitigated one way or another and the rights do well there is a good chance of outperforming. This point is difficult to win the argument with but as a supporting factor a stock I have been writing about for more than five years is Vale (VALE) which is a client holding. Vale as a proxy for materials is up 350% versus about 25% for the Materials Sector SPDR (XLB) in the last five years. This just an example which has flaws of its own but one (mega cap) stock pick combined with one sector avoided (the financials) and an investor would be noticeably ahead of the market for a decent chunk of time, that being five years.I will say it is very reasonable to question how many people should be making a lot of active decisions in the market. People tend to not understand the volatility they have taken on until after a big decline resulting in panic sales so I am not saying everyone should be actively managing their portfolio but the idea of has to by mathematical certainty seems far too simplistic. I won't go into detail on another point here so the at post is not too long but another variable is the occasional buying and selling of stocks or funds that can add value as opposed to what I believe is a static portfolio in Bernstein's comments.Bernstein also has choice words for levered and inverse ETFs, But in practice, they’re being used as speculative tools. Some of them are silly, some are dangerous, and some, such as inverse and leveraged ETFs, are downright criminal noting that they do not work over longer periods of time. He adds what is this concept that an investment can only be used for one day? This is not an investment. Who has the predictive power of knowing which way the market is going to go on one day? and finally To the extent that people are using them more for speculation than for long-term investment, it’s a horrible thing.I would not disagree with an opinion that says many people will misuse a levered fund but speculation plays an important role in the functioning of capital markets. I think this is a rather elementary point actually--markets need liquidity to function and speculators are a source of liquidity. Again any argument that says most people should not be speculating is one I would agree with but the framing that speculation is a bad thing and tools that facilitate speculation are bad things is, again, too simplistic.To the extent new investors are trying to learn and seek out Bernstein as a source I believe they are learning the wrong thing. There is a difference between a fund being downright criminal and a fund simply being unsuitable for many people."
2010-05-03,Volatility Sold in XLB,"The SELECT SECTOR MATERIALS SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is receiving a bullish trade this afternoon as the ETF trades flat on the session; the ETF was in the red most of the session and recently rebounded. Freeport McMoran (NYSE: FCX) has been weighing heavily on the ETF as it represents 9.49% of the ETF. The Jan 2011 $31 put was sold on the bid 5,000 times for $2.09. This represents a trader betting that recent volatility will subside in the name and that the ETF should find a base around this level. The trader is willing to get long 500,000 shares at $28.91 should the ETF continue to fall. I am short vol in the SELECT SECTOR MATERIALS SPDR and in FCX."
2010-05-11,Using Credit as a Precursor to Equities ,"Yesterday, Goldman Sachs was out with an investor research note citing the positives of following the credit markets as a precursor to movement within the equity markets. Today they are out with round two of that note where they are reiterating their recommendation to hedge Financial names (NYSE: XLF) and Industrials (NYSE: XLI) from moves to the downside. Goldman Analysts said that equities are a little too quick is forget the recent volatility experienced than other markets and that implied volatility of 6-month options remains 37% higher than two weeks ago, a level inline with options prices from August 2009 (not exactly a great period for equities). CDS spreads of all companies in the S&P 500 are still 16% wider than two weeks ago as well. Credit markets appear to be less worried about Energy (NYSE: XLE) and Material (NYSE: XLB) names, though, Goldman analysts say. They said they would focus on buying calls and call spreads in these sectors. Come to the Traders Expo and learn from the top traders in the industry!"
2010-05-11,April 2010 Rewind - Rocky Top,"Although April finished the month near bull-run highs, equity prices began to show signs of increased volatility towards the top as the specter of sovereign debt downgrades came back to the fore along with a whole host of additional worries [also see February].The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and NASDAQ 100 cash indices nevertheless finished higher across the board by +1.48%, +1.40% and +2.16%, respectively. At this point we all know how this story unfolded. After the cascade failure on the sixth and subsequent nuclear weekend Euro bailout, equities are again marching higher.

2010-06-09,"Sector Funds: Best, Worst, and Mid-Year 2010 Stock Market Outlook (SPY, XLF, XLE, XLP, EEM)","Sector Funds: Best, Worst, and Mid-Year 2010 Stock Market Outlook (SPY, XLF, XLE, XLP, EEM) June 8th, 2010 Goto comments Leave a comment The past 45 days have brought about an abrupt change in the markets. After being in a phase of never-wanting-to-go-down from February through April, markets around the globe have turned south in a hurry. Steep losses in equity prices since late April have put most of the markets around the world in the red for the year. In the U. S., the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) that tracks the popular S&P 500 index ($SPX) is down 3.8%. Overseas markets have lost more. The iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (NYSE:EFA) and iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index ETF (NYSE:EEM) that serve as proxies for developed and emerging markets, respectively are down 15.2% and 10.4%, respectively. Best Sector Funds From a sector perspective, consumer discretionary and industrials have fared the best year-to-date. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLY) and Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLI) are up 6.1%, and 2.7%, respectively. The Fidelity Select universe has performed similarly with Fidelity Select Consumer Discretionary (FSCPX) and Fidelity Select Industrials (FCYIX) advancing 7.1% and 2.3%, respectively. Strong year-over-year earnings improvement from recessionary levels helped consumer discretionary shares to rebound from low valuation levels at the start of the period. Stronger demand for industrial goods from emerging markets and falling energy costs contributed to relative outperformance of the industrial sector. Performance of sector funds: Year-to-date, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLY) has led the way while Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLB) has lagged. Worst Sector Funds Commodity-related materials and energy sectors have fared the worst year-to-date. Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLB) and Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLE) are down 11.6%, and 9.3%, respectively. Fidelity Select Energy (FSENX) is down 12.8% while Fidelity Select Materials (FSDPX) is down 8.7%. Strong demand for commodities helped materials and energy stocks gain early in the year. The advance wore off when the U. S. dollar gained ground and commodity prices started to falter. While BP’s (BP) Gulf of Mexico disaster and Australia’s plans for increasing mining taxes added to these sectors’ woes, worsening fiscal condition of many European economies is the more important reason for weakness in materials and energy shares. Mid-Year 2010 Stock Market and Sector Fund Outlook As the midpoint of year 2010 approaches, a few themes dominate investor attention. They include: Strained fiscal situation in Europe and the possibility of a contagion Rising inflation and slowing growth in emerging markets Flat or worsening employment situation in the U. S. Against this backdrop, will consumer discretionary continue as a momentum play to be the best performer in the second half? Or is it turn for commodities as a value play to take charge? Momentum plays tend to work well in the short-term and value plays in the long-term. The turning point in leadership change often comes when the crowd piles to overvalue sectors in favor. Likewise fear or neglect leads to undervaluation that is eventually corrected. More often, sectors with adequate momentum and reasonable valuation have a higher probability of becoming best performers. See: Sector Rotation – Increase Your Sector Selection Success by 75% With Europe’s financial troubles likely far from over and persistently high levels of unemployment acting as a headwind for consumer spending, neither commodities nor consumer discretionary investments may prove to be the best performer in the remainder of the year. Listed in alphabetical order with no probabilistic significance attached, the odds of consumer staples, financials, or industrials turning out to be second half’s best performer appear higher. Fidelity Select Consumer Staples (FDFAX), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLP), Fidelity Select Financial Services (FIDSX), Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLF), Fidelity Select Industrials, and Industrial Select Sector SPDR ETF are among the mutual funds and ETFs available for these sectors. As always, selected industries or groups within winning sectors will likely provide investors bigger gains. We will be directing our efforts at identifying such leaders when we recommend new investments for Premium Service readers on June 30.

2010-06-11,May 2010 Rewind - Sovereign Debt Cascade,"After a rocky April, May was a veritable cascade reminiscent of Fall 2008, featuring an all-in retrace now well past a 10% official correction here at the mid-month on sovereign debt contagion and building double-dip worries.The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and NASDAQ 100 cash indices all finished lower for the month by -8.20%, -7.92%, -7.41% respectively for negative annual readings across the board. With many major indices now just under their respective 200-day moving averages and volatility still fairly high and erratic, it feels as if the markets could run hard either direction at any moment.Sentiment: NegativeVolatility: Moderate to High (VIX 20-46)Direction: Highly Negative [Click to Enlarge/ Weekly ETF Analyses/ Prior Monthly Summaries/ Mrkt Rotation Selections]The Style-Box was calculated using the following PowerShares™ ETFs: Small-Growth (PWT), Small-Value (PWY), Mid-Growth (PWJ), Mid-Value (PWP), Large-Growth (PWB), and Large-Value (PWV).

2010-06-21,Summer Camps  06-21-2010,"Cusick’s Corner The market continued to pull back into the After Hours but was able to hold key support, SPX 1110. While the Yuan news was a potentially nice boost for market sectors that we mentioned in the Midday, it only incited the Deflationary or Disinflation camps who believe that this is either a rouse by the Chinese or they just fired their last proverbial bullet before the G20 meeting. Speaking of meetings -- there is a two-day Fed meeting and the market will be watching to see if there’s any inflation and if keeping it in check is still the only storyline, plus if there’s any language that surfaces about disinflation. Existing Home sales due out at 10:00am ET -- watch to see if there is a dramatic pullback in the pool of buyers in the face of the tax credits being pulled. See you Midday. Stocks traded broadly higher early, but then gave back the gains and the major averages finished with modest losses Monday. The table was set for gains on Wall Street after Asia’s equity markets cheered news that China was abandoning the peg between the yuan and the US dollar. The link between the two currencies was implemented two years ago during the global financial crisis and the change in policy signals greater confidence in China’s economy, as well as a more open trade policy from China. However, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied as much as 140 points in morning trading, the gains were short-lived and market action had turned mixed by midday. There were no domestic earnings or economic news to guide the action and, stocks slumped into the close. After a four-day winning streak, the Dow close down 9 points on the session. The tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 20.7. Bullish Flow Amgen (AMGN) shares gained $1.32 to $56.52 and seemed to benefit from news that Affymax’s (AFFY) anemia drug, Hematide, resulted in greater health risks, including heart attacks. AFFY plummeted 68.8 percent on the news. Meanwhile, AMGN, which produces its own anemia drug, jumped higher and options volume hit 2.5X the average daily, with about 30,000 calls and 10,000 puts traded. The top trades included some apparent diagonal spreads, where one more investors were selling October 55 calls and buying January 62.5 calls, 5000X in morning action. The spread is possibly a bet that AMGN will hold around $55 through the October expiration, and then rally during the three months that follow. Bullish order flow was also seen in Revlon (REV), Alcoa (AA), and Heinz (HNZ). Bearish Flow General Mills (GIS) shares lost 59 cents to $37.95 and put volume surged, with roughly 33,000 contracts traded on the day. The volume represents 18X normal and compares to 4,400 calls. The action was focused on July 37.5 puts, which traded 13,400X. August 35, August 37.5, and July 36 puts saw interest as well. There was no company specific news to explain the action, but implied volatility rose nearly 9 percent to 25, suggesting demand for put options was driving up options premiums in the food company Monday. Bearish flow also picked up in Emerson Electric (EMR), AMD, and Micron Technology (MU). Index Trading Options action picked up in the Russell 2000 Small Cap Fund (.RUT) Monday. The index, which tracks the share price action of 2000 of the smallest US-listed companies, gave up early gains and finished the day down 6.89 to 660.03. In the options market, 135,000 puts and 54,000 calls traded on the index. The top trades were in the July 550 – 560 put options, which traded more than 42,000X each. Looks like bullish spread traders were taking positions, paying about $1.10 for the 550s and collecting $1.40 on the 560s, possibly betting that the Russell will hold above 560 through the July expiration (25 days). ETF Trading Select Sector Basic Materials Fund (XLB) added 19 cents to $31.14 Monday and options volume hit 8.5X the average daily, with 81,000 puts and 35,000 calls traded. The top trades were in the July 30 – 32 put spread, which was bought at 70 cents, 30000X in morning trading. That is, an investor – probably an institution – bought 30,000 of the July 32 puts at $1.10 and sold 30,000 July 30 puts at 40 cents. The spread offers a potential pay-off (excluding commissions) of $1.60 if shares of the fund fall to $30 or less by the July expiration."
2010-06-21,China Ordering U.S. Takeout  06-21-2010,"Cusick’s Corner The market did like the news out of China, so the question is – who or what will benefit from this new stance on the Chinese currency? One major benefactor, non-Chinese manufacturers could benefit from the Yuan’s greater buying power. Thus, China would be able to buy products that are manufactured outside of China at competitive rates. This does presume that the demand for such products or growth will continue in China and that the Chinese government does not step in and stop the Yuan from appreciating, right now +/- .5% a day. Some potential sectors to benefit from this new policy -- Construction Equipment, Base Metals, Coal, and Fertilizer are some of the more notable. See you After Hours. Stocks are broadly higher on news China unpegged the yuan from the dollar, but the stock markets are now well off session highs at midday. The table was set for morning gains on Wall Street after the People’s Bank of China announced plans to remove the peg between the yuan and the US dollar. The initial move was implemented two years ago during the global financial crisis. Its removal signals greater confidence in China’s economy and a more open trade policy. Equity markets rallied across Asia on the news and were broadly higher across Europe before the start of trading in New York. With no domestic economic or earnings data to guide trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied and was up more than 140 points mid-morning. However, trading has turned a bit more cautious midday and the Dow is now up 61 points. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) edged up .47 to 24.42. Trading is active due to the options expiration, with about 4.5 million calls and 3.6 million puts traded at 12:45 ET. Bullish Alcoa (AA) is up 7.7 percent to $11.96 and the best gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Monday. Options action is heating up as well, with about 80,000 calls and 21,000 puts traded so far. The top trade is a block of 8,900 July 12 calls on the International Securities Exchange, where sentiment data indicate this trade is a customer opening a new position. 32,600 contracts now traded. Another 14,500 June 13 calls also changed hands. Shares have been battered in recent months, down nearly 37 percent since January, and some investors might be buying July calls as a cheap way to play the stock for a rebound. Storage device maker EMC shares are up 7 cents to $19.42 and call options are busy Monday. 26,000 traded so far, which is 6X typical volume for midday and 6X the number of puts. Investors are showing the most interest in July 20 calls. 17,900 contracts have traded so far and, with 85 percent of the volume traded at the asking price, it appears that call buyers are dominating the action, possibly looking for a move beyond $20 by the July expiration. Bearish A couple of chipmakers see bearish trading Monday. AMD is one of them. Shares are up 21 cents to $9.04 and 16,000 puts traded in the name. The action includes a buyer of 5,500 August 9 puts at 74 cents each in morning trade. The position was tied to a block of 240,000 shares, according to a source on the floor, and probably a volatility play. Meanwhile, the July 9 – 10 put spread was bought at 68 cents, 2500X. That is, the investor bought 2,500 July 10 puts at $1.14 and sold July 9 puts at 46 cents, which creates a bearish position with a max profit if shares fall to $9 or less by the July expiration. Meanwhile, Micron Technology (MU), another semiconductor company, is up 15 cents to $10.15 and a block of 19,000 January 9 puts traded at $1.08 on the ISE. It was an opening customer buyer, according to ISEE sentiment data. The trade was probably tied to a block of 589,000 shares that traded at about the same time. So, it doesn’t appear to be a straight bearish bet, but rather a volatility play on the chipmaker. Unusual Volume Movers Russell 2000 Small Cap Fund (IWM) options volume is running 2X the usual, with 161,000 contracts traded and put volume accounting for about 68 percent of the activity. Select Sector Basic Materials (XLB) options activity is running 5X the usual, with 63,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 98 percent of the volume. General Mills (GIS) options volume is running 7X the usual, with 36,000 traded and put volume representing 89 percent of the activity. Unusual volume is also being seen in Amgen (AMGN), Xerox (XRX), and Intermune (ITMN). Implied Volatility Movers After falling from 86 to 73 last week, implied volatility in BP is moving higher Monday. Shares are down 3 percent to $30.80 after the oil giant warned that the cost of the oil spill is reaching $2 billion. Meanwhile, options trading remains active, with another 75,000 calls and 66,000 puts changing hands so far. Implied volatility is now up 5.5 percent to 77."
2010-06-23,Homebuilders (XHB) Rise Despite Bad Report,"Homebuilders (XLB) rallied today despite a terrible earnings report. The homebuilders ETF ended the day up 1%. Home sales fell to historic lows as investor appetite for home buying has disappeared. A lot of this is attributable to the expiration of tax credits. Chief economist of Gluskin Sheff, David Rosenberg appeared on CNBC’s Fast Money this evening to talk about the weak housing market. Rosenberg stated that the US economy is still incredibly fragile and believes that the economy is incredibly weak. He thinks that the chances of a double dip recession are growing. Rosenberg predicted that unemployment will continue to rise and that inflation will be subdued. He is bullish on the Asian economy and believes that investors should trade commodities for the rest of the year."
2010-06-23,Victor Niederhoffer,"An interview of Victor Niederhoffer on Slate made the rounds yesterday (I found it through FT Alphaville). It was about the two huge blow ups that Niederhoffer endured, what went wrong, what he learned and his mind set now.I've read a few other things about him and while this may not have been very different it is useful. There are people in this business, and it seems like he is one of them despite what he says, that are willing to really bet big, face the consequences of a big bet gone wrong and then start over from scratch.The point clearly seems to be about learning from Niederhoffer's mistakes. From there you incorporate what you learn from him into your own investment philosophy. He seems to have been done in by enormous bets with no counter strategy and presumably misuse of leverage in pursuit of those big bets. These things have done plenty of people in and will do so in the future. Students of market history have seen this story play out countless times.Philosophically this blog is at the completely opposite end of the spectrum or road in rural Iceland as the case may be. I don't ever want to worry about the stock market, client portfolios or my own. Further I don't want clients to worry about their portfolios either. Everyone has different panic points and the dread that goes with watching portfolios values implode is very predictable and I would think more people would make a priority out of avoiding that feeling. Yet somehow people can not envision this when they are placing the trade or trades that put them at risk for this dread.I can remember a few years ago after a lottery ticket biotech stock blew up, a reader left a comment disclosing that this now dusted stock had been 25% of his portfolio. While I don't remember what the stock was I remember him saying something about the extent to which he believed in the company and the regret naturally felt. Given that any stock can blow up (Fannie Mae and WaMu were very blue chip) there can be very little justification for the typical person to make the types of go for broke bets that did in the reader above and Niederhoffer.What would be your reaction to 25% or more of your money disappearing that quickly? Do you even know what your reaction would be? An even better question would be do you ever want to find out? As I said above some people can exist this way but finding out the hard way you are not one of those people would be an awful experience.There is nothing wrong with buying a lottery ticket biotech, long shot gold miner or the like; these are perfectly valid things to buy but measuring a wipeout's impact on your portfolio is crucial in this context. If you put 2% on what turned out to be a fraudulent Chinese hair growth company (Seinfeld reference) could you live with that consequence? I think most people could. What about 5% or 10%? At some point is your line in the sand or know thyself number.This is also true of the overall portfolio and the portfolio's volatility budget. You know how to build a portfolio that is more volatile than the market or less volatile than the market. If every stock you pick is more volatile than the corresponding Sector SPDR then your portfolio will obviously be more volatile than the market.Most people are unlikley to pick the most volatile stock in every sector, instead there would be a blend of volatile and low octane names to create a mix that can be lived with when things in the market are their worst. From there an investor could increase or decrease their overall volatility.For example an investor could swap out of the Materials Sector SPDR (XLB) into a much more volatile stock like Silver Wheaton (SLW) the silver (sort of) miner. Assuming the stock is not a fraud (I don't own the name but don't believe it is a fraud either) then the decision about adding the name and volatility that goes with it becomes either a good decision or bad decision based on top down factors for the market and the materials sector and bottom up factors based on SLW's situation at the time in question.Buying SLW at $19 in spring 2008 on the way to $3.45 (assuming no sell discipline) becomes less of a problem at 3% of the portfolio; it simply becomes a lesson learned not a radically altered financial plan."
2010-07-02,Big Money Still On Sidelines  07-02-2010,"Cusick’s Corner The Unemployment number has come and gone with very little fan fare. The bottom line is that the private sector was hiring, maybe not at the levels that the market would like, but it dampened the impact of government layoffs. While the bounce into the Midday is nice, the market internals are horrible, everything is negative. I expect the potential for the downside to be tested, especially since there seems to be a lot of big money still on the sidelines. A few things to monitor -- Gold after the 50-Day Moving Average was broken with some authority, plus the Euro which has been on a momentary delay. One final note, take some time out this weekend to reflect and be thankful for the freedoms that we have in this great country and those who have served and given the ultimate sacrifice to continue these freedoms. Have a great weekend. The major averages are lower again Friday after economic data showed the US economy losing more jobs than expected in June. According to the Labor Department, 125,000 jobs were lost last month. Economists were looking for a drop of about 100,000. While the unemployment rate declined to 9.5 percent from 9.7 percent, hourly earnings also fell .1 percent. Economists were looking for the rate of unemployed to increase to 9.8 percent and for hourly earnings of +.1 percent. After several days of disappointing economic news this week, the mixed jobs report did little to ease concerns about the deteriorating economic outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had fallen in eight of nine trading sessions prior to Friday, saw modest gains at the open. It proved short-lived, however, and another wave of selling pressure has the Dow down 75 points midday and ahead of the three-day Fourth of July weekend. The NASDAQ lost 12.7. Meanwhile, options activity is slowing, with about 2.6 calls and 2.7 million puts traded through 12:15 ET. Bullish A number of biotechnology names saw increasing call volume after Bloomberg BusinessWeek reported that Sanofi Aventis is prepared to make a major acquisition in the US. Biogen (BIIB), for example, is up $2.19 to $48.91 and options volume is 19X the average daily. 19,000 calls and 3540 puts traded so far. August 55 and 60 calls are the most actives. Genzyme (GENZ), Allergan (ALGN), and Celgene (CELG) are seeing bullish trading as well. AMD calls have seen heavy trading all week and the action continues Friday. 62,000 call options traded on the chipmaker through midday. The volume is 8X the expected activity and compares to 8,100 puts. Shares are down 27 cents to $7.12 and the focus is on October 7, October 8, August 7, October 6, and January 2012 10 calls. There is no news to explain the spike in activity and some of the action might offset (close) existing positions. However, this week’s heavy call volume is also noteworthy because it comes ahead of earnings, due on July 15. Bearish The top options trades so far today are in the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) exchange-traded fund. SPY holds the same stocks that comprise the S&P 500 and shares are down 79 cents to $101.97 midday Friday. One strategist appears to be bracing for additional losses and sold the July 100 – 105 bearish risk-reversal at 12 cents, 29000X. That is, they bought 29,000 July 100 puts at $1.15 and sold 29,000 July 105 calls at $1.27. The bearish trade might be a closing position or possibly a short-term hedge. July options come off the board two weeks from today. Pfizer (PFE) is down 8 cents to $14.15 and a substantial spread traded in the January 2011 puts after one player apparently bought 10,000 January 14 puts at $1.47 and sold 20,000 January 11 puts at 49 cents. This bearish 1x2 ratio spread is possibly a hedge or a straight bearish bet. It makes its best profits if shares fall 22.3 percent to $11 by the January expiration. PFE has fallen nearly 30 percent since mid-January. Longer-term, the ratio spread trader might have a bullish view, however. By selling January 11 puts, they are making the statement that they are willing to buy the stock at that price. Unusual Volume Movers Select Sector Energy Fund (XLB) options volume is running 3X the usual, with 49,000 contracts traded and put volume accounting for about 99 percent of the activity. Select Sector Tech Fund (XLK) options activity is running 2X the usual, with 49,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 65 percent of the volume. Motorola (MOT) options volume is running 7.5X the usual, with 65,000 traded and put volume representing 94 percent of the activity. Unusual volume is also being seen in Juniper Networks (JNPR), ADS, and RadioShack (RSH). Implied Volatility Movers RadioShack implied volatility is moving after takeover chatter surrounded the electronics retailer Friday. It’s unsubstantiated speculation, but triggered a 4.7 percent rally in the stock, to $20.76. Options volume hit 5X the average daily, with about 16,000 calls and 2,200 puts traded through midday. Implied volatility rose 7 percent to 58.5."
2010-07-12,Big Money Yet to Buy Into July Rally  07-12-2010,"Cusick’s Corner The major indices held up into the After Hours, minus the small caps like RUT. This does not totally dampen the potential for upside, but it is putting traders a little more on the alert. Alcoa (AA) announced and beat by a penny but the market in the After Hours is muted, potentially signaling that the market has priced in some of the good news and is waiting to be surprised even further. Watch the 1075 level on the SPX downside to hold and 1085 on the SPX to be broken, which would potentially get some of the big money that is yet to buy into this July rally. See you Midday. Major averages finished with modest gains on a relatively slow news day. With no economic data or earnings of importance to guide the action, the tone of trading was wait-and-see ahead of earnings from Dow component Alcoa (AA), which unofficially kicked off the reporting season with a release Monday afternoon. A number of other Dow stocks, including Intel (INTC) Tuesday, report earnings later in the week. Meanwhile, the economic calendar picks up midweek with Retail Sales and FOMC minutes due Wednesday. So, trading was a bit cautious ahead of the earnings and data. After sluggish trading throughout most of the session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average strengthened late in the day and finished up 18 points. Bullish Flow Yum Brands (YUM) saw active trading ahead of earnings. Shares of the restaurant company, which owns name brands like Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and KFC, finished the day up 60 cents to $40.87. Options volume hit 8X the recent average daily, with some investors munching on YUM July 40, 41, and 42 calls. July 40 puts were actively traded as well. At the end of the day, 12,000 calls and 9,690 puts had changed hands. Implied volatility was up 18.5 percent to 32, ahead of the results which are due Tuesday after the closing bell. Bullish order flow was also seen in Pride International (PDE), P&G, and Lowe’s (LOW). Bearish Flow An interesting three way spread in ResMed (RMD), a thinly-traded San Diego-based medical equipment company. Shares gained 42 cents to $65.35 and an investor apparently sold 1,000 August 70 calls at $1.00 to buy the August 60 – 55 put spread at 75 cents. This spread traded for a 25 cent net credit and seems to represent a bearish short-term view because it offers a max pay-off if shares fall to $55 by the August expiration, or 15.8 percent in 39 days. It might be to hedge shares around the company’s earnings which are expected in early August. Bearish flow also picked up in Casey’s General Stores (CASY), Paychex (PAYX), and Cracker Barrel (CBRL). Index Trading The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) finished the day down .55 to 24.43 following a day of relatively slow trading Monday. The S&P 500 traded in a 10-point range and finished up .8. Volatility has been easing a bit over the past few weeks and it seems that some investors expect the trend to continue. More than 100,000 VIX August 25 puts traded Monday. The action included a buyer of 50,000 contracts at $1.40 each. The premium purchase, which represents a $7 million investment, is a bold move because the contract could expire worthless if VIX rallies back beyond $25 between now and the August expiration. ETF Trading Select Sector Basic Materials Fund (XLB) saw increasing action ahead of Alcoa’s earnings. XLB holds all of the material (metal, chemical, paper, etc) companies from the S&P 500 and Alcoa is the 10th biggest component in the exchange-traded fund. Some players seemed worried about the short-term outlook for the group, as 66K XLB puts traded Monday. One strategist apparently bought a block of 40.6K September 47 puts at 73 cents each. 42.3K contracts traded total. The position might not work out too well, however. Alcoa is up in after hours Monday after posting better-than-expected results and also raising estimates for aluminum demand."

2010-07-14,An Interesting Materials Play,"Positive market sentiment and a temporary renewal of risk appetite are positive catalysts for material ETFs, but does that mean it's time to stray off the reservation and embrace a name beyond the usual suspects such as the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials ETF (NYSE: IYM)? Maybe, maybe not, but it is worth noting the First Trust Materials AlphaDEX ETF (NYSE: FXZ) has performed admirably in the past week, adding 8%, though that trails XLB and IYM. FXZ is nothing if not well balanced as the top-10 holdings account for just over 33% of the ETF's total weight. Names like Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF), CF Industries (NYSE: CF) and Huntsman (NYSE: HUN) dot the lineup. Here's the knock on FXZ: An expense ratio of 0.7%. XLB checks in at just 0.22% and IYM checks in at 0.47%. Volume on FXZ also pales in comparison to its rivals. Bottom line: FXZ will follow its friends higher, but is not likely to outperform and if FXZ won't outperform, why stick around for higher fees?

2010-08-03,Reason Yen's Move is Not Bullish for Japan 08-03-2010,"Cusick’s Corner The market did close the day in the red, another grinding session after an initial pop in the morning. The Japanese Yen currency has been on a tear and some market insiders who often confer with me, gave me some additional insight -- this move in the Yen is not a bullish signal for Japan, but more of a sign that the Japanese could be potentially bringing their risk capital home. Reason being, the Japanese could be seeing some potential volatility that at this juncture would not have explanation. Keep an eye on larger index strategies like straddles and strangles. (Go to oX site to learn more about these strategies.) Seeing larger trades in long straddles or straddles may be a potential signal that strategists are positioning for a volatile move in the next few weeks. See you Midday. Trading was slow on Tuesday after big gains the day before. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rallied for 210-point advance Monday, opened lower after economic data Tuesday morning showed personal incomes and spending flat during the month of June. Economists were expecting no change in spending, but a .1 percent increase in personal income. Later, separate economic reports showed factory orders down 1.2 percent in June; which was better than the 1.8 percent drop in May, but worse than the .5 percent decline that economists had expected. A third piece of data showed pending home sales falling 2.6 percent in June. Meanwhile, the day’s earnings news was mixed (see the ETF section below). At the end of the day, investors found few reasons to bid stocks higher after Monday’s big move. Consequently, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 38 points and the NASDAQ lost 11.8. Bullish Flow Genworth (GNW) has been the subject of interesting spread trading during the past two days. Shares lost 41 cents to $13.26 Tuesday and are down some 16 percent since the company reported earnings last Friday. Some investors seem to view the weakness as an opportunity for bullish trades. For example, late Tuesday, one strategist apparently sold 500 December 12 puts at $1.08 to buy 500 December 15 – 18 call spreads at 68 cents. The three-way spread traded 1000X Tuesday and about 4,000X the day before. The strategist is probably looking for a rebound by the December expiration and entering this spread on hopes for a move beyond the $18 strike price during that time. Also, by writing $12 puts; the strategist is saying that they’re willing to buy the stock at that price from now through the December expiration. Bullish order flow was also seen in Pfizer (PFE), Frontline (FRO), and Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA). Bearish Flow CIT Group (CIT) shares lost 65 cents to $36.67 and a noteworthy spread traded in the New York-based financial services company late Tuesday. One strategist apparently bought 20,000 January 30 puts and sold 20,000 October 30 puts, creating a massive time spread at a $1.05 net debit. Looking at the open interest numbers, the spread is possibly rolling of a position – or closing out October to buy a new position in January. On the other hand, this might be a calendar spread on expectations that shares will hold above $30 through the January expiration, but then begin to fall from that point forward. Bearish flow also picked up in Express Scripts (ESRX), GE, and Kohl’s (KSS). Index Trading Trading slowed in the index market, with only about 325,000 index calls and 343,000 index puts traded on the session, or 68 percent of the recent average daily. One index did see increasing action: the US Dollar Settled British Pound Index (XDB), which tracks the pound/US dollar currency pair, X 100. The index finished up .53 to 159.47 and options volume rose to 8X the average daily, led by a three-way spread trade. In this position, the strategist apparently bought 300 September 152 calls at $7.93 (probably closing) and sold 300 December 156 put – 162 call strangles at $5.76 (to open), perhaps betting the index will trade in a range between 156 and 162 during the months ahead. ETF Trading Options activity picked up in a few of the Select Sector Funds, as some investors look beneath the surface of the major averages and for opportunities with specific sectors of the market. There are nine Select Sector Funds and together they hold the five hundred S&P 500 stocks. For example, the Select Sector Basic Materials Fund (XLB), which holds all of the basic materials names, fell 60 cents to $32.27 after Dow Chemical (DOW) tumbled on earnings news Tuesday. An interesting trade surfaced in the XLB when an investor apparently bought 10,000 January 32 puts and sold 10,000 January 28 puts, to create a bearish spread or hedge in the fund. Meanwhile, the Healthcare Select Sector Fund (XLV) finished up with help from Pfizer’s strong earnings and investors were focused on XLV August 30 calls, with 12,330 traded. Finally, the Select Sector Consumer Discretionary Fund (XLY) lost 39 cents to $31.62 on disappointing earnings from P&G (PG). Players snapped up XLY Jan 19 puts, with 12,500 traded on the day."
2010-08-15,USCI – The Commodity ETF Evolves,"The United States Commodity Index Fund (USCI) began trading last Tuesday (8/10/10). The fund’s objective is to match the SummerHaven Dynamic Commodity Index Total Return, less expenses. The underlying index is comprised of 14 futures contracts, selected on a monthly basis from a universe of 27. Composition of the rules-based index in any given month will be determined quantitatively. Contrary to what you might have read, USCI is not an actively-managed ETF. The fund’s composition is not determined by manager discretion. Instead, the holdings are determined by an index and remain static between monthly rebalancings. The prospectus (pdf) elaborates on the fact that no human bias is introduced into the process. Even its name clearly identifies this product as an “index” fund. That said, the index is dynamic and its composition can change significantly from month to month. Quantitative dynamic indexes are nothing new. PowerShares pioneered their use in the ETF space, launching more than 40 funds using this concept beginning with the introduction of PowerShares Dynamic Market (PWC) in 2003. However, I believe USCI is the first time the concept has been used with a pure commodity ETF. The underlying index was developed by SummerHaven Index Management LLC and is based upon academic research by Yale University professors Gary B. Gorton and K. Geert Rouwenhorst, and Hitotsubashi University professor Fumio Hayashi. Much of the research behind the fund is documented in the 2004 paper titled “Facts and Fantasies About Commodity Futures.” The methodology employed by the index seeks to minimize the harmful effects of contango (negative roll-yield) by favoring commodities in backwardation (positive roll-yield) and longer term contracts. Each month 14 of the 27 eligible commodities are selected to be index components, with a minimum of one commodity from each sector (energy, grains, industrial metals, livestock, precious metals, and softs) to ensure diversification. The monthly commodity selection is a two-step process: The seven commodities with the highest percentage price difference between the closest-to-expiration futures contract and the next closest-to-expiration futures are selected (the seven displaying the most backwardation). From the remaining 20 eligible commodities, the seven with the highest one-year percentage price change are selected (the seven displaying the most one-year momentum). If all six sectors are not represented by at least one commodity, then a substitution process is employed until the constraint is satisfied. The 14 selected commodities are included in the index for the next month on an equally-weighted basis. Due to the dynamic monthly commodity selection, the sector weights may vary from approximately 7% to 43% over time. Selections are made on the fifth business day before the end of the calendar month. The rebalancing then occurs during the last four days of the month, with one-fourth of the required rebalancing taking place each day. For the month of August 2010, the fund’s sector allocation and component futures contracts are: Energy (14.3%): Crude Oil (WTI) SEP11, Natural Gas OCT10 Grains (14.3%): Soybean NOV10, Soybean Meal OCT10 Industrial Metals (21.4%): Copper OCT10, Nickel MAR11, Tin DEC10 Livestock (7.1%): Lean Hogs DEC10 Precious Metals (21.4%): Gold OCT10, Platinum OCT10, Silver DEC10 Softs (21.4%): Cotton DEC10, Coffee DEC10, Sugar #11 OCT10 USCI is the latest evolution of commodity investing products for retail investors. Phase 1 kicked-off 54 years ago with the introduction of Van Eck International Investors Gold (INIVX) in 1956. It is currently the oldest mutual fund still in existence targeting commodity producer equities. A plethora of similar funds arrived in the 1980s. Phase 2 was the introduction of commodity producer ETFs, the first being SPDR Select Sector Materials (XLB) 1998. Phase 3 is marked by the arrival of the first physically-backed commodity ETF, SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), in 2004. Physically-backed products have been extremely successful with retail investors, but are thought to be impractical for anything except precious metals. Phase 4 began in 2006 with PowerShares DB Commodity Index (DBC), the first ETF based on commodity futures. Retail investors, impressed with the ability of physically backed ETFs to track spot prices, were not fully prepared for ETFs implemented with futures contracts. The past four years have been a period of prolonged contango conditions in the commodity markets. As such, futures indexes have greatly underperformed spot indexes, leaving many retail investors perturbed. Now we begin Phase 5, which is marked by ETF sponsors employing dynamic indexing techniques to combat the negative effects of contango, capture the positive effects of backwardation, and maximize total return. USCI is likely to be just the first of many such Phase 5 products as the evolution of commodity investing continues. USCI has an expense ratio of 0.95%. Additional information on the fund can be found in the links above and on the USCI summary page, USCI details page, and USCI fact sheet (pdf).

No income, revenue, or other compensation (either directly or indirectly) received from, or on behalf of, any of the companies or ETF sponsors mentioned."
2010-08-17,Factory Output Rises ,"The Federal Reserve reported bullish news on the United States manufacturing sector this morning. Output from the nation's factories rose 1 percent in July, spurred on by an increase in auto production. The increase in was larger than estimated with analyst expecting a 0.6 percent bump in production. A full range of sectors saw increased production. Production of consumer goods increased 1.1 percent and durable goods rose 4.9% in the month. Construction supplies even saw a small increase of 0.5 percent. Overall, industrial output has risen nearly 7.7 percent throughout the year, cutting through all the negativity about the health of the economy. Investors can take advantage of this bump in output by betting on exchange traded funds within the manufacturing sector. Adding an investment in the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI) to either the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) or iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials (NYSE: IYM) gives a broad swath of the entire manufacturing sector. Over the short term, these ETFs should ride high on the bullish news. Over the long term, if the economy is truly strengthening, the ETFs will continue to outperform."
2010-09-16,Under The Hood: A Forgotten Materials ETF,"We all know that emerging markets ETFs get a lot of attention and we all know that traders love materials stocks. So if you combined the best of both worlds, materials and emerging markets stocks, into one ETF, that ETF would be pretty popular, right? Maybe not. At least that's the case with the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Materials Index Fund (Nasdaq: EMMT). So let's go under the hood with this ETF. First off, the big problem that EEMT has to deal with is light volume. In this case, light means almost non-existent at just over 1,600 shares a day. Second, the EMMT has collected barely over $6 million in assets since making its debut on January 20. If we're still talking about weak volume and low assets in a year, we may be writing EMMT's obituary. Third, the expense ratio is a tad high at 0.72%. OK, that's the bad news. The good news is that this 58-stock ETF will get you exposure to some of the top global materials names. Brazil's Vale (NYSE: VALE), the world's largest iron maker, and South Korean steel giant Posco (NYSE: PKX) are found among EMMT's top-10 holdings. Chemical & Mining Co. of Chile (NYSE: SQM) is another top holding and EMMT is one of the few ETFs that holds Peru's Buenaventura (NYSE: BVN). So give EMMT some credit, it is diversified across a good mix of countries and companies with exposure to different areas of the materials complex. In terms of performance, EMMT is even with the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the iShares Global Materials ETF (NYSE: MXI). MXI has a big allocation to Vale as well, that ETF isn't focused exclusively on emerging markets whereas EMMT is. Given the weak volume and the problems that presents, just keep an eye on EMMT for now or only commit to a small position. The concept is sound with this ETF, but sometimes that's not enough. Beat the market consistently by receiving real-time trade alerts from the ETF Professor!"
2010-09-27,"ETFs Are The Worst Idea Ever, No Wait They Are Mankind's Savior","That title sort of sums up some of the current reading about how ETFs are bad versus the only things we should be using and of course both extremes are wrong. I have to say I am astounded that such bi-polarism still exists 17 years after the first US ETF started trading.From worst idea ever camp is this article from Chuck Jaffe and what I believe was the tipping point for the collapsing ETF theme that a reader was kind enough to link to. Jaffe's article seemed to support both Bogle's idea that they are bad because of the trading they allow (so not the actual product but human behavior) while conceding ETFs might be the better wrapper than traditional funds but he concluded with the suggestion to wait for five or ten years for the revolution to actually prove out.My first response to the collapsing ETF idea was no because in the now famous XRT example it would, IMO, be worthwhile for the fund provider to keep a popular and actively traded ETF seeded with capital if somehow there were to be a run. While I believe it would be worthwhile, folks like IndexUniverse did some sleuthing on the matter and the short answer is that creation/redemption process does not allow for the scenario that Bogan laid out in the original paper.Just because a collapse as described by Bogan appears to not be plausible some other sort of serious malfunction could be. Part of the case against ETFs stems from how they reacted during the flash crash. I think the narrowness of the argument is a miss because of how short lived the event was and someone who actually thought a fund with an NAV of $50 at noon could all of a sudden be worthless at 2:30 probably needs help with their investing. But looked at from a broader perspective the funds malfunctioned for a short while after many, mostly bond funds, had previously malfunctioned during the Lehman panic days drifting very far from their NAVs.It would be easy to envision some sort of event where an ETF does not recover from some sort of distortion so quickly. I don't know what this might be but ETFs are investment products that rely on certain things working properly. There can be no assurances that all the things that need to work properly can do so 100% of the time.From the Mankind's Savior camp is an article from Seeking Alpha that seemed like nothing but a commercial for a website so I'm not going to link to it but it laid out a bunch of different portfolios using broad ETFs from different asset classes (there were no benchmark comparisons). So the entire business is built on broad ETFs and there are plenty of advisory shops who run their practices this way--that is relying solely on the ETF wrapper.The best use for ETFs is of course in the middle of the two extremes. A point I have been making from the start has been that ETFs are just one of several tools available to all types of market participants. For some they are vehicles to be traded frequently, for some they are core investments and others still (this is where I fit in) they are part of the solution for portfolio construction and cycle navigation.Yesterday I read an article making the case for uranium as an important investment for quite a few years to come. For anyone for whom this thesis resonates they would probably want to find a way to add uranium to their portfolio. Once that decision has been made the next step should be figuring the best way in and being open to buying whatever this step yields.Uranium is obviously a play on the nuclear energy theme. GlobalX has filed for a uranium fund but it is not trading now and there can be no guarantee it will ever trade. There are three nuclear energy ETFs that I am aware of each with varying amounts of uranium exposure. The iShares Global Nuclear Energy Index Fund (NUCL) appears to have 18.1% in uranium miners, the PowerShares Global Nuclear Energy Portfolio (PKN) appears to have 13.6% and the Market Vectors Nuclear Energy ETF (NLR) appears to have 39.5%.If you are convinced uranium is the single most important theme of the decade are the weightings in any of the ETFs enough? If the 39.5% in NLR might be enough, is the 18% in Japan then a problem? If I loved uranium the 39.5% would not be enough but the Japan weighting would not be too big of an issue as the correlation of the fund to Japan looks low enough to me. FWIW the PowerShares Coal ETF (PKOL) has about 11% in uranium and while the fund itself is interesting it is clearly not a pure play for uranium.So until GlobalX Uranium comes, if it ever does, and an investor thinks uranium is the most important theme what are they going to do? Obviously right here right now they must consider a stock. There are a few stocks out their to choose from mostly from Canada and Australia. It doesn't make sense for an investor to deprive them self of the most important investment theme waiting for an ETF that could be several years away or might never come.Contrast that with something like copper miners where there are at least two ETFs or water where there are I think four ETFs and of course there are others. Here there is more choice for anything else that might be the most important investment theme which in a way creates more work; the decision of whether one of the ETFs is better or one of the stocks.A building block for this post is my belief, that IMO has been playing out, that investors above a certain account size need to learn about and implement narrow investments in their portfolios instead of some combo of SPY/EFA/IWM. My preference is to go sector by sector and a perfectly valid way to do this is with a mix of products (for most people this means individual stocks combined with ETFs). Sticking with the materials sector example a blend of something broad based like the Materials Sector SPDR (XLB) or one of the foreign sector funds that will be heaviest in BHP Billiton (BHP) along with a miner of some specific resource or a fertilizer company can work without taking obscene risk.This can be applied in all of the sectors and ETFs can be a big part of the solution. For people not wanting too much reliance on ETFs functioning normally I would suggest that a basket of staples stocks with products you have used your entire life that have paid decent dividends for decades would not likely all go to zero at the same time.The all or none idea with ETFs above a certain account size seems woefully misguided."
2010-09-29,Real Estate Sector May Be Poised For Bounce  09-29-2010,"Cusick's Corner The market continued to stay in a tight range into the After Hours, but one key sector, Energy (XLE) was moving today. With the month-end and the breakouts continuing, market watchers and traders are looking for the next sector to join the upside party. It looks like the Real Estate sector could be next, especially since tomorrow is the last day in September and money managers need to get there October positions in place. The Real Estate sector has been lagging this impressive move and may be poised for a bull bounce. Watch the Claims data premarket, this could get the market moving. See you Midday. Major averages finished with modest losses on a very slow news day. With no earnings of significance or economic data to guide the early action, stocks slumped at the open following a day of losses in Euro-zone equity markets. Benchmarks were under pressure in Europe amid strikes and protests in several countries. Individuals were speaking out against recent measures designed to help ease the European Debt Crisis. The concern is the growing resistance might thwart some of the recent policies designed to ease the crisis. Yet, while stocks slumped, there wasn't much volatility in overseas markets and, after falling in morning trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was flat into midday. From there, modest selling pressure surfaced late and, when all was said in done, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had traded in a narrow 70-point range and lost 23 points on the session. The NASDAQ gave up 3. Bullish Flow Monsanto (MON) lost another 75 cents to $48 and has now suffered a three-day 31.4 percent slide. The weakness has stirred up a lot of action in the options market. After a day of very heavy trading Tuesday, approximately 30,000 calls and 26,000 puts traded Wednesday. One contrarian-minded investor seems to be looking for a rebound in the weeks ahead, however, and apparently initiated a November 55 – 60 call spread at a 58-cent debit, 5000X in afternoon trading Wednesday. That is, they bought 5,000 November 55 calls for 85 cents and sold 5,000 November 60 calls at 27 cents. The spread is a bullish play, as it makes its best profits if shares rally to $60 or beyond through the November expiration. Bullish options action was also seen in Blue Coat Systems (BCSI), Hewlett Packard (HPQ), and Schlumberger (SLB). Bearish Flow NetLogic (NETL) saw an increase in options activity today. Shares added 48 cents to $28.09 and have now added 10.9 percent over the past four days. Yet, while shares have performed well, the tone of trading in the options market seemed to take a bearish turn after 7,375 puts and 1,695 calls traded on the Mountain View, CA semiconductor maker. October 29 puts were the most actives. 3,677 changed hands and, according to data from WhatsTrading.com, two-thirds (or 66 percent of the volume) traded at the asking price. So, it appears the put buyers were dominating the action and perhaps making bearish bets or taking defensive positions to protect recent gains in the shares. Bearish flow also picked up in Flour (FLR), Principal Financial Group (PFG), and DineEquity (DIN). Index Trading The PHLX Semiconductor Index (.SOX) saw a bit more volume than usual amid relative strength in the chip sector Wednesday. SOX is a cash-settled index that tracks the price action of 21 leading semiconductor and semiconductor equipment companies. The index added 2.33 to 351.79 and options volume rose to twice the average daily, with some players apparently selling October 345 calls. The contract is 6.79 points in-the-money and these investors were possibly banking profits following Wednesday's move. Overall, there hasn't been much noteworthy activity to report from the index pits lately. 337,000 calls and 418,000 puts traded across all products Wednesday, which is only about 71 percent the average daily volume. ETF Trading Put volume picked up in the Basic Materials Select Sector Fund (XLB) amid relative weakness in the sector Wednesday. Shares finished down 26 cents to $32.91 and options volume hit 6X the average daily. 43,000 puts and 6,000 calls traded on the exchange-traded fund. One investor was responsible for a large percentage of the flow. They bought a block of 35,000 December 29 at 50 cents per contract. Since XLB holds all of the basic material names from the S&P 500 Index, the massive premium purchase was probably initiated by a portfolio manager looking to hedge his or her exposure to that market sector."
2010-10-26,Current OX Put/Call Ratio 10-26-2010,"Cusick's Corner The Dollar fluctuations and the pullback in the Euro put early pressure on this market. I am still concerned with the amount of bullishness, especially on the retail side with the put call ratio at oX at .41, meaning that for every 2.5 puts being purchased there are still 6 calls being bought. This is also telling me that if we do have a bounce in the Dollar or a rash of mixed earnings, the weak hands in the market (usually retail) will start to jump ship. This will only add more short-term volatility and test the fortitude of the day traders who keep coming in and buying dips only to sell out on the bounce. See you After Hours. Stocks opened broadly lower, but trading has turned mixed midday after data showed improvement in October Consumer Confidence. The table was set for losses early following a round of weak earnings results from several prominent names including Texas Instruments (TXN), Bristol Meyers (BMY), and US Steel (X). However, stocks strengthened at 10:00 ET when the Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence increased to 50.2 in October, up from 48.6 in September and better than the 49.0 reading that economists had expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average moved higher on the data, is flat at midday and 76 points off its worse levels. The NASDAQ has added 7.5. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) is up .51 to 20.36. Trading in the options market is active, with 3.3 million calls and 2.5 million puts traded by 12:00 ET. Bullish Netflix (NFLX) shares are up and options are actively traded after Jim Cramer made positive comments about the video rental company on the latest episode of Mad Money. According to Cramer, Wall Street just doesn't get Netflix, but the company has huge potential. Shares are up $6.52 to $173.35 midday Tuesday and today's options volume includes 27,000 calls and 14,000 puts. A lot of the focus is on Weekly call options that expire on 10/29. The 170, 175 and 180 strikes are the most actives. Adobe (ADBE) options are actively traded. Shares added 10 cents to $28.30 and the volume includes 17,000 calls, which is 1.5X the normal for midday and compares to put volume of just 2,100 contracts. Most of the action is in November call options with strike prices ranging from 29 to 33. Shares saw a 60-cent spike in morning trading on takeover speculation. It's totally unsubstantiated, but is probably the reason that call activity is outpacing put activity by a margin of 8-to-1. Bearish Commscope (CTV) shares rallied more than 30 percent yesterday after Reuters reported that Carlyle Group is looking to acquire the company for $3 billion. CTV is down 21 cents to $29.95 today and a noteworthy trade is a November 28 – January 32 risk-reversal, 10000X. That is, one investor bought 10,000 of the November 28 puts and sold 10,000 of the January 32 calls. This spread might be a shareholder looking to protect or “collar” the stock after yesterday's big run higher. Arris Group (ARRS), a Georgia-based communication equipment company, is up a penny to $9.62 and options volume is 14X the recent average daily ahead of an earnings release (10/27 after market). Most of the action is in the November 10 puts and being driven by opening put buyers, according to sentiment data. 3,450 traded through midday, pushing implied volatility up 13 percent to 52. Shareholders looking to protect the stock ahead of earnings might be initiating the trades. Or, the put buying might be outright bearish trading ahead of report. Unusual Volume Movers Research In Motion (RIMM) options volume is running 2.5X the usual, with 172,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 72 percent of the activity, according to data from website WhatsTrading.com. Basic Materials Select Sector Fund (XLB) options activity is running 2X the usual, with 21,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 60 percent of the volume. Abercrombie (ANF) options volume is 4.5X the typical levels, with 43,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 63 percent of the activity. Increasing volume is also being seen in Bristol Meyers (BMY), Ford Motor (F), and Royal Caribbean (RCL). Implied Volatility Movers Ford Motor (F) implied volatility is easing. Shares are up 30 cents to $14.45 and within striking distance of a 52-week high of $14.57 set in late-April. The automaker reported a quarterly profit of 48 cents per share this morning, which was ten cents better than Street estimates. The stock is up and options volume includes 126,000 calls and 53,000 puts through midday. Implied volatility is down about 15 percent to 34.5, and falling back towards a 52-week low of 32.5."

2010-11-05,Market Continues Kung Fu Fighting  11-05-2010,"Cusick's Corner The market continues Kung Fu Fighting, and while the Fed intervention seemed quite frightening, those Cats (the Fed) fight with expert timing! (I never thought that I would work this one into the Corner, thanks Doug.) But the Fed seems to have pulled off the greatest timing for easing and in front of what seems to be on the surface, Job growth that is quite pleasing. I want to note that, yes, we still have 9.6% unemployment, but the +160K growth in private sector jobs is the largest in over 3 years. Now the big question is will the Funky men from Chinatown decide it's time to chop it down. The BOJ decided not to get into the fray, not adding any monetary injection going into today. This sudden intervention has made this market skip (to the upside), but could this motion make the weak longs trip? Let's see if the market continues its Kung Fu Fighting into the After Hours, thanks Carl! Stocks are trading mixed after big gains the day before. The underlying tone of trading remained upbeat early Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 220 points Thursday and after the Labor Department reported a surprise jump in job creation during the month of October. The data showed the US economy adding 151,000 payrolls last month, which was significantly better than the 60,000 increase that economists had expected. The rate of unemployed remained unchanged at 9.6 percent, which was in-line with estimates. Average hourly earnings rose .2 percent and twice as much as expected. However, after the big rally Thursday, the market failed to build on the gains despite the good jobs data. Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 18 points and midday. The NASDAQ lost 4. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) edged down another .41 to 18.11. Trading in the options market remains very active, with about 6.5 million calls and 4.3 million puts traded so far. Bullish A huge spread traded in Citi (C) options Friday morning. Shares have added a dime to $4.43 amid strength in the banking names after Fed officials signaled yesterday that they will allow some banks to begin paying dividends if they meet certain capital requirements. The news sparked a rally in a number of banking names late Thursday and the momentum spilled over to trading early Friday. BofA (BAC) and JP Morgan (JPM) are the Dow's best gainers. Meanwhile, Citi is trading higher and one player sold 60000 Citi December 4 calls at 51 cents to buy 60000 January 4.5 calls at 28 cents. This massive spread might be a roll, closing out a position in the December 4 calls that are 43 cents in-the-money, to open a new bullish position in January 4.5 calls, which are 7 cents out-of-the-money. Coventry Healthcare (CVH) shares are rallying and call options are busy after the managed care company reported a quarterly profit of $1.25 per share, which was 58 cents better than Wall Street analyst estimates. The stock is trading up $1.08 to $24.56 on the news and options volume is running 5X the average daily, with 4,670 calls and 40 puts traded on the ticker. December 24 calls are the most actives. 3,100 traded and, with nearly all of the volume trading at the ask, it looks like call buyers are driving the action and looking for shares to perform well through the December options expiration. Bearish IShares Small Cap Fund (IWM) saw an interesting four-way put spread Friday morning on the CBOE. According to a source on the exchange floor, one investor sold 47,500 November 70 - 64 put spreads at 28 cents and bought 45,000 December 73 – 68 put spreads at $1.30. This looks like a position adjustment or a roll. That is, the investor is selling to close a position in the November spread to buy a new bearish position (or hedge) in the December options. A large block of puts traded on the Basic Materials Select Sector Fund (XLB) Friday. XLB is one of nine select sector funds that collectively hold all of the S&P 500 stocks. Shares touched a new 52-week high and are up 8 cents to $36.27 midday. Meanwhile, in morning trade, one player bought-to-open a block of 35,000 January 35 puts at $1.08 per contract. The massive put purchase is likely to hedge exposure to the basic materials sector of the market, which has been the most volatile on the nine sectors in recent weeks. Unusual Volume Movers Sandridge (SD) options volume is running 9X the usual, with 69,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 89 percent of the activity, according to data from website WhatsTrading.com. Schlumberger (SLB) options activity is running 2X the usual, with 68,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 79 percent of the volume. Hecla Mining (HL) options volume is 3.5X the typical levels, with 65,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 91 percent of the activity. Increasing volume is also being seen in US Bancorp (USB), Human Genome Sciences (HGSI), and United Continental (UAL). Implied Volatility Movers Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) options are actively traded and implied volatility is higher on unconfirmed market speculation that Starbuck's (SBUX) might be looking to partner with GMCR. The chatter comes after partnership talks between Starbuck's and Kraft (KFT) broke down. Today's chatter is unsubstantiated, but seems to be the catalyst for the action in GMCR. Shares have added 92 cents to $34.80 and call volume is running 3X more than normal. About 10,000 contracts traded. Meanwhile, implied volatility is up 7.5 percent to 67 on the session."

However, the gains didn't show strong participation from investors. Once again, we are leaving the support/resistance levels the same for the DJIA (DIA), S&P 500 (SPY), and Nasdaq Composite (QQQQ) (see below). Stocks appear to be at a reflection point looking for a catalyst to resume the stock market direction uptrend or a reason to go into correction mode and possible establish a new base safer for opening new positions in stocks.

2010-11-24,"BTDStocks.com Wednesday, November 24, 2010 End-Of-Day Update","The stock market recovered all the losses from yesterday and then some with very strong gains but the session didn't indicate strong participation from investors (albeit on small pre-holiday trade). In contrast, yesterday showed strong losses and investors dumping shares (possible on emotion from the events in Korea). We did point out this week that the recent correction has been constructive and the Semiconductor Index (SOX) has shown strength (a good sign) while the broader market showed some weakness. Based on the trend we are raising both the support/resistance levels on the DJIA (DIA), S&P 500 (SPY), and Nasdaq Composite (QQQQ) (see below). However, until we see more positive follow through, the prudent approach (if you need to own stocks) is to own small positions in stocks and keep the majority in cash based on the current stock market direction.

2010-11-30,Market Range-Bound  11-30-2010,"Cusick's Corner Even though the market has been in a range, it's been full of intraday volatility. One way to participate in this kind of volatility in a mitigating fashion is to use spreads. Take a look at the JC Penny bear put spread that traded under the Bearish section -- this strategist is implementing a bearish sentiment in front of the same stores data out 12-2. When I look at the implied volatility, which is low, buying the at-the-money strike makes sense. But if the stock does not move in the right direction (down in this JCP strategy), then the strategist wants to mitigate that decay risk in the long option by selling the out-of-the-money put, reducing the premium risk in the option that was bought by over 29%. The trade off is that they give up downside profits if the stock goes below $30. So with a bearish sentiment and interpretation of low implied volatility (check out our Volatility View), the ATM bear put spread is a potential strategy to consider. See you After Hours. Stock market averages fell Tuesday despite a round of positive economic news. Data released at 9:45am ET showed the Chicago PMI, a gauge of regional manufacturing activity, to 62.5 in November; which was up from 60.6 in October and significantly better than the 59.6 reading that economists had expected. Separate data released 15 minutes later showed the Conference Board's Consumer Sentiment Index up to 54.1 in November, from 49.9 last month and better than the 52.0 that economists had predicted. Yet, with the euro still reeling and European equity markets suffering another round of losses, the tone of trading remains cautious on Wall Street as well. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 40 points through midday. The tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 25.5 after Google (GOOG) shares fell on news of an EU investigation into complaints against the Internet giant. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) is up 1.31 to 22.84. Overall options volume is light and seems a bit more defensive than usual, with about 3.4 million calls and 3.4 million puts traded through 12:30 ET. Bullish UPS sees brisk trading. The action comes the day after FedEx (FDX) shares rallied on an analyst upgrade. FDX gained 4.7 percent Monday after Credit Suisse raised the stock to Outperform. Today, UPS is in focus. Although shares are flat at $69.88, 23,000 call options have traded on the shipping company. The volume represents more than 5X the norm and compares to put volume of 4,100 contracts. December 72.5 calls are the most actives. 11,850 changed hands so far. Dec 70, Jan 75 and July 67.5 calls are seeing brisk trading as well. Ann Taylor (ANN) is running to a new 52-week high and was recently up $1.03 to $26.85. Meanwhile, options volume is 2.5X the average daily after 9,200 calls and 333 puts traded on the retailer. December 25 and January 28 calls are the most actives, with 2,300 and 5,550 traded, respectively. No news to explain the bullish flow. It might be a play on November same store sales numbers. Many retailers will release their results Thursday. Bearish Collective Brands (PSS) is seeing heavy trading ahead its earnings. Shares are off 50 cents to $16.77 and in the midst of a three-day 6.5 percent skid. Meanwhile, 21,000 puts and 2,400 calls have traded on the retailer through midday. The action is happening across a number of expiration months and strike prices. December 16, January 15, and March 17.5 puts are among the most actives. Implied volatility is up about 12 percent to 64, as some players seem to be bracing for a volatile move in PSS when the company reports Wednesday after the closing bell. JC Penney (JCP) adds 55 cents to $33.32 and a noteworthy trade in the retailer today is a December 30 – 33 put spread. One strategist apparently paid $1.20 for the spread, 2000X. That is, they bought 2,000 December 33 puts at $1.71 and sold 2,000 December 30 puts at 51 cents each. It might be a play on November same store sales numbers, due December 2. Unusual Volume Movers Basic Materials Select Sector Fund (XLB) options volume is running 3.5X the usual, with 70,000 contracts traded and put volume accounting for 62 percent of the activity, according to data from website WhatsTrading.com. UPS options activity is running 2X the usual, with 28,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 85 percent of the volume. Alcatel Lucent (ALU) options volume is 9X the typical levels, with 18,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 83 percent of the activity. Increasing volume is also being seen in Urban Outfitters (URBN), Supervalu (SVU), and FedEx (FDX). Implied Volatility Movers The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX), which tracks the implied volatility of S&P 500 Index (.SPX) options, hit a high of 23.55 and is up 1.20 to 22.73 midday Tuesday. VIX has added 1.53 for the month of November. Meanwhile, one strategist seems to be looking for additional volatility through January and recently initiated a January 27.5 – 35 (1X2) call ratio spread at a dime (credit), 10000X. They sold 10,000 27.5s at $2.20 to buy 20,000 Jan 35s at $1.05. While they keep the 10-cent credit (X10000X100) if VIX settles below 27.5 at the expiration, they make better money if VIX sees a substantial rally between now and then."
2010-11-30,"BTDStocks.com Tuesday, November 30, 2010 End-Of-Day Update","For the third session in a row stocks had a down day. Just like yesterday stock opened weak and had an afternoon rally. Only today stocks materially weakened in late trading and couldn't finish near their highs. As a result, we are lowering the support/resistance levels for the DJIA (DIA), S&P 500 (SPY), and Nasdaq Composite (QQQQ) (see below). The S&P 500 tested and held its 50-day moving average on a closing basis again and the Nasdaq Composite has yet to test its 50-day moving average. Only the DJIA of the three major indexes is below its 50-day moving average. The Semiconductor Index (SOX) remains one of the strongest areas still above its 21-day moving average. Investor fear increased as the Volatility Index (VIX) rose 9.3% and closed above its 200-day moving average. As we stated in last night's update the market has been working off the recent investor complacency that has been building up. Also, as we noted last night we removed the US Dollar long ETF (UUP) and Euro short ETF (EUO) from our watch list at today's market open price. Overall, UUP and EUO returned 4.2% and 12.8%, respectively while they were on our watch list. In summary, the prudent approach (if you need to be invested in stocks) indicates it is ok to own small positions in stocks based on how the stock market direction consolidation is currently acting.

2010-12-01,"BTDStocks.com Wednesday, December 1, 2010 End-Of-Day Update ","As we have been suggesting the recent stock market consolidation has been constructive enough that we have reframed from calling it a correction. One reason for our thesis is the Semiconductor Index (SOX) has remained strong and outperformed the broader market during the consolidation phase. Good economic data today propelled stocks significantly higher. Breadth showed strength but the one missing ingredient from today's action was strong volume. However, we are increasing the support/resistance levels for the DJIA (DIA), S&P 500 (SPY), and Nasdaq Composite (QQQQ) (see below). In contrast to yesterday's session investor fears as measured through the Volatility Index (VIX) eased and if this continues could signal further upside action for stocks.

2010-12-02,"BTDStocks.com Thursday, December 2, 2010 End-Of-Update","The stock market had another nice day in terms of price action with the major indexes all posting gains of 1% or higher. Breadth was strong again (not like when the rally began in March 2009-could indicate a late stage bull market) but volume figures are making it difficult to determine if the resumption of the rally is for real or just a head fake. With the jobs report due out before the open tomorrow the market has rallied the last two sessions from a preliminary report that the job numbers for November is above expectations. However, below average market participation could be an indication that investors want to see proof before investing more aggressively.

Looking ahead, Dollar weakness has the UUP as short-term oversold as Emerging Markets (EEM) are now overbought, with RSI-2′s of 1 and 98, respectively. By the end of January, ETF Prophet will be hosting these statistics on a live daily basis!

2011-01-04,"The Commodity Sector Rotation Cycle: Think Gold, Then Copper, Then Crude","Attached is a short note about the commodity sector rotation cycle. Namely, that gold leads copper and copper leads crude….. The commodity sector rotation cycle is something you might want to consider as you watch prices' peaking in the commodity sector in 2011 as it has a strong bearing on the stock mkt sector rotation cycle. There is a central tendency for copper to stay bid into May. Not sure copper can make it into May. There is also a central tendency for the basic material sector to peak before copper prices. Thus, I don't expect the basic material sector to have much legs left in them as we enter 2011. The relative price strength/ ratio spread chart (shown below) of the basic material sector (XLB) against the SP500 double topping at the onset of 2010 and close of 2010 suggests that the basic material sector is going to have a difficult time outperforming the broad market in Q1 2011. Meanwhile the energy sector has been outperforming both basic materials and the broad mkt in recent months. Consistent with both the commodity and stock market sector rotation cycles, this trend of relative outperformance in the energy sector should continue awhile longer. The relative price chart below also suggests money is flowing out of higher beta stocks as 2011 gets underway. Evidence of money flowing into lower beta more defensive stock sectors (not shown) has not yet been indicated. However, I would be looking to front-run and get positioned for money flowing into the more defensive stocks in early 2011 as and when those buy signals on defensive stocks show up."

2011-01-07,Jobs Number Not Big Enough for Bulls  01-07-2011,"Cusick's Corner The employment number didn't look big enough to keep all the bulls happy, so there's been some small profit taking. The EU is weighing down the market and the Euro. I'll be watching the Euro's close today to see if it cannot break and settle above 1.30, the currency could continue its pullback. Also want to see if the market can hold the lower end of today's range of 1262 on the SPX. If not, looks like we could have some more potential volatility hit the market. See you After Hours Stocks are trading broadly lower following a mixed jobs report Friday. The headline number showed the US economy adding 103,000 jobs in December. Economists were looking for an increase of 150,000. However, November numbers were revised up (to 71,000 from 39,000) and the rate of unemployed fell to 9.4 percent from 9.8 percent. Economists were looking for a decline to 9.7 percent. Hourly earnings increased by .1 percent, which was in-line with expectations. Trading was steady on the heels of the data, but volatility picked up midday. The European Debt Crisis is causing some concern, as yields rose on Portuguese debt Friday and the euro made a run back below 1.29 against the buck. Meanwhile, JP Morgan (JPM) is down 3.7 percent and the biggest loser in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on a day of relative weakness in the financial sector. The Dow is off 86 points and the NASDAQ has lost 29. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) added .63 to 18.03 and session highs. Trading in the options market is active, with 5.9 million calls and 4.9 million puts traded through 12:30pm ET. Bullish A couple of transportation names are seeing relative strength and bullish flow Friday. AMR calls are actively traded. Shares of the airliner are up 16 cents to $8.61 and today's options volume includes 64,000 calls and 2,400 puts. May $11 calls, which have traded 24,800X, are the most actives. August 10 and Jan2012 $15 calls are seeing busy trading as well. AMR saw heavy trading yesterday as well, with 48,000 calls and 3,440 puts traded in the name. The company is in the midst of a battle with online travel agents Orbitz and Expedia. The call buying might be in anticipation of a positive outcome in the matter. December traffic statistics were also reported this week. Norfolk Southern (NSC) shares are up and call options are actively traded. Shares of the railroad company touched a new 52-week high and are up 91 cents to $64.71 midday Friday. Meanwhile, options volume is 7X the average daily, with 12,000 calls and 2,000 puts traded on the day. March 70 calls, which have traded 8,000X, are the most actives. In addition, with 91 percent trading at the ask and open interest of 1,145 contracts, it looks like some investors are buying to open new positions and looking for NSC to run beyond $70 by the March expiration. Bearish Wells Fargo (WFC) shares are trading down after a Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled against the company in a mortgage case. The court upheld a ruling against WFC and US Bancorp (UBS) in a matter related to how banks transferred mortgages into securitizations. WFC is down $1.08 to $31.07 and options volume is 3X the average daily. 120,000 calls and 79,000 puts traded. The biggest trades of the day are blocks of more than 9,000 January 29 and 35 calls, apparently sold at $2.50 and 11 cents, respectively. Supervalu (SVU) is under pressure and puts are actively traded. Shares came under pressure in morning action and are down 52 cents to $8.68 midday. Options volume is 9X the average daily after 46,000 puts and 5,440 calls traded on the grocery chain. January 7.5 puts, which have traded 23000X, are the most actives. Feb 7 and 8 puts are active as well. The volatility in shares and increasing put volume is probably related to concerns about earnings after a couple of brokerage firms issued cautious commentary on SVU this week. Unusual Volume Movers JP Morgan (JPM) options volume is running 2X the usual, with 220,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 50 percent of the activity, according to data from website WhatsTrading.com. Verizon (VZ) options activity is running 2.5X the usual, with 92,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 65 percent of the volume. AMR options volume is 3X the typical levels, with 67,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 96 percent of the activity. Increasing volume is also being seen in KB Homes (KBH), SPDR Retail Trust (XRT), and Basic Material Select Sector Fund (XLB). Implied Volatility Movers Financial Select Sector (XLF) implied volatility is moving higher amid relative weakness in the sector after a high court ruled against WFC and USB in mortgage case (see Bearish Flow). XLF is down 1.9 percent to $16.05 and today's trades include large blocks of March 17 calls, which appear to be liquidating trades on the news. Meanwhile, implied volatility has risen 8.5 percent to 25."
2011-01-07,Some Metal/Mining ETFs To Consider ,"If you believe that the metals sector will continue to see outperformance in 2011, then having a portion of your portfolio in the sector is more than beneficial to your financial health. One of the bigger ETFs is SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), which encompasses such stocks as Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF), Massey Energy (NYSE: MEE). The SPDR S&P Metals and Mining charges 35 basis points, the lowest among similar ETFs. It uses its size and scale to compete on price. It has over $1.2 billion in assets. iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials (NYSE: IYM) is another ETF to consider, as it has such holdings as Freeport McMoran (NYSE: FCX), Newmont Mining Corporation (NYSE: NEM), Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE: BTU) and others. iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials (NYSE: IYM) has a small expense ratio, compared to the other ETFs in the sector. It only charges 47 basis points. The last ETF being mentioned in this article is the largest one, Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLB) It's the largest ETF in the sector, with well over $2 billion under management. It holds such companies as largest holdings being Du Pont (NYSE: DD), Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (NYSE: FCX), Dow Chemical (nyse: DOW) and others. The fund has an expense fee of 21 basis points. I would expect these ETFs to continue to rise over the next 6 months or so, as quantitative easing continues to weaken the dollar, and commodities and those companies associated with them, continue to rise. After 6 months is anybody's guess, because no one is sure what will happen with the Federal Reserve once QE2 is finished. You can also look at some individual metal ETFs, if you believe a particular metal will outperform. Palladium and platinum have performed extremely well since the Fed first announced QE2, and I would expect that the first part of 2011 will be no different. ETFs Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) and ETFS Physical Platinum Shares (NYSE: PPLT) are ways to play these trends. Disclosure: no position in names mentioned"

2011-01-20,Time for a Correction? 5 Hedging Strategies,"As the market has been grinding higher over the past few months, we've heard many bears state that we are overbought and that we're due for a correction. The overbought part was likely true, but no correction was in sight on the back of QE2. I don't like being short when the printing presses are on full steam and I believe a real recovery is underway, but I'll never flinch at taking a profit or even use some of them to put on some hedges... After all, would you buy a house without insurance?I have spent the majority of Wednesday evening reviewing charts - mainly of indices and sectors, to see where I would like to place my hedges. When I believe we are due for a correction, and only expecting a minor 5-7% one if that, I have no problem putting up to 2%-3% of my entire portfolio value into hedges. Just like it is smart to be diversified when purchasing equities and call options, it is smart to be diversified when shorting and buying put options. In this article I will show you 5 ideas on how I plan on hedging my portfolio and why I believe it is a good idea.Idea #1: Hedging the S&P 500Most portfolios have exposure to the S&P 500, so it is worth spending some money on insurance against this index.(click chart to enlarge)As we can see from the S&P Index SPDR (SPY) chart above, we had a pretty ugly day on heavier than normal volume Wednesday. You can also see that the RSI or relative strength has been trading in overbought territory since January 3. Typically it is a good time to lighten up or purchase protection when trading in overbought levels like this. We sold off by close to 1% Wednesday and the RSI still is trading at the higher end of the range, 64.59. You can pull up a chart of the VIX or Volatility Index, which trades inversely to the S&P 500, and you will see the VIX was trading near oversold levels in that same time frame. The VIX also had a big 9% spike Wednesday regaining the 20 day moving average, the VIX is another great indicator to get an idea of when to hedge.S&P Hedging Strategy:Although volatility is cheap (yes even with the 9% spike Wednesday) I would purchase put spreads versus outright put options on the S&P 500 SPDR (SPY), but I would purchase more time versus if I were just buying puts I would likely choose to purchase less time. Purchasing more time requires me to be proactive as I might have to decide when to trade out of this strategy so the hedge actually works. I would purchase March 127 put options and sell (1 for 1) March 117 put options against them. This strategy would cost me roughly $210 per put spread and would protect me down to just above the 200 day moving average at 117. If the market corrects more significantly and the SPY is trading below 117 on March expiration this strategy would return $1,000 per put spread or a return of 476%. Of course us bulls out there don't want the maximum return from this spread, but it would certainly help pad the portfolio if the market did correct in such a manner.Idea #2: Hedging the NASDAQ 100Like the S&P 500, many of us have exposure to big tech names which fall into the NASDAQ 100. One way we can hedge many of our stocks in the NASDAQ is to purchase similar put spreads on the Powershares QQQ Trust (QQQQ).(click chart to enlarge)From the chart above, we can see many similar comparisons to that of the S&P SPDR chart. ETF was trading in overbought territory for days, heavier than normal volume to the downside. But the really bearish signal I see from Wednesday's price-action, and signals a potential key reversal, is that the QQQQ managed to open on the highs, which also happens to be higher than Tuesday's high as well as the 52 week high, but gave all of Tuesday's gains back closing below Tuesday's low and on heavier volume. This is called a bearish engulfing candle pattern and cannot be illustrated any better than this.NASDAQ Hedging Strategy:Again I would look at using the 20 and 200 day moving average to get an idea on where to purchase and sell put options. I would buy the March 55 put options and sell the March 50 put options. I could get this strategy for roughly $84 per put spread. If the NASDAQ corrected significantly and the QQQQ was below 50 on March options expiration this strategy would return $500 per spread or a return of 595%.Next I will outline 3 specific sectors using the Sector SPDR ETFS. I have looked at many sectors and believe the three to follow have the greatest risk and could have the most significant correction if we get a pull back.Idea #3: Hedging the Health Care SectorThis sector had some very ugly price action as well Wednesday. We can see a very similar bearish engulf candle pattern from the chart below of the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV).(click chart to enlarge)We can see the ETF opened within pennies of its 52 week high before selling off throughout the day. This ETF also engulfed all of Tuesday's move on greater volume. Not looking too promising for the bulls out there.Health Care Sector Hedging Strategy:With this ETF I am going to stay shorter term and purchase at the money February 32 put options for $46 per contract. I am choosing to stay shorter term on this ETF because the volatility stands at a whopping 14.75% (sarcastic) for February, and because I am trading on this signal and because this is sector specific I wouldn't want to overpay for time value.Idea #4 Hedging the Energy SectorThis sector is by far one of the best performing sectors since the most recent market bottom, which leads me to believe it may have the biggest correction if we get an overall market correction.(click chart to enlarge)As we can see from the Energy Select Sector ETF (XLE) above, it opened on the 52 week high and sunk like a stone all day engulfing Tuesday's entire move higher, all on greater volume. This again is very ugly price action and would signal me to sell energy stocks or purchase put protection. This is one of very few ETF's that traded above 70 on the RSI for more than 3 days.Energy Sector Hedging Strategy:I would also plan on purchasing shorter tem puts on this ETF, because this is sector specific and would think based on the ugly price action and recent overbought levels, it is due to correct sooner rather than later. I am structuring my bet on this ETF a bit differently than the last few. As you can see from the chart of the XLE above, the stock left a couple of gaps on the way up, and I believe those have a high probability of being filled if we get a pull back. I would purchase puts below the 20 day moving average at minor support near 68, and I would sell puts near 60. Therefore I would put on a February 68/60 put spread. This would cost me roughly $75 per spread. This strategy is a bit more bearish and factors in quite a significant correction, but selling the 60 puts versus the 61 or 62 puts didn't make too much of a difference compared to potential returns, especially because that lower gap which would need to be filled around 59.94. If this ETF sold off and closed at or below 60 on February options expiration this strategy would return $800 per spread or 1,067%.Idea #5 Hedging the Materials Sector:This sector was perhaps the ugliest of the day Wednesday. Many of the largest holdings in the Materials Select Sector ETF (XLB) such as Monsanto (MON) and Freeport-Mcmoran (FCX) have had unbelievable runs lately and need to take a breather.(click chart to enlarge)This ETF had an extremely ugly potential reversal day Wednesday . The ETF opened near the high and 52 week high and sold off the entire day on very large volume engulfing all of the previous two days moves higher. This stock also fell below the 20 day moving average for the first time since mid November. This again is a potential key reversal day to watch and would be a signal to sell material stocks or put on some hedges.Material Sector Hedging Strategy:As we can from the minor pull back in mid November the ETF broke below the 20 day but then bounced off of the 50 day moving average and continued a nice uptrend. You will also see Fibonacci retracement levels drawn on the chart which are also key levels to watch. The Fibonacci levels come in very close to the moving averages on the chart, but I will use both to structure my put spread. Again I would choose the February contracts to keep this hedge shorter term. I would purchase my first put near the 50 day moving average at 37 and sell put options near 34. If it broke below the 50% retracement, I would want to roll out into the next month and purchase another put spread (perhaps the 34/30) as the stock would likely head lower. This strategy would cost roughly $45 per spread and would return $300 per spread or 667% if this ETF closed at or below 34 per share on February options expiration.The ideas outlined above are bearish strategies and should not be considered if you think the ETF will continue higher or have a very minor correction in the near future. However if you feel the ETF could correct in the near future, these strategies could help protect your portfolio. To get a better understanding of stock options and different option strategies please check out my Simplified Stock Option Trading E-Books. These are just examples and are not recommendations to buy or sell any security; if you're more bullish/bearish, you'll want to adjust the strike price and expiration accordingly.The reason option volumes have surged in the last five years is because they are a great way to hedge your portfolio as well as create income off of your shares (see chart here). Keep in mind when using this strategy it is essential that broker commissions are low enough to profit from the position.I currently do not own any strategies mentioned above, but may open them in the next few days."
2011-01-24,Blue Chips Picking up Slack  01-24-2011,"Cusick's Corner This week starts off with a change at the helm. Small Caps, RUT, have lost all momentum and the Blue Chips, DJX, are picking up the slack early in this earnings season. The S&P and NASDAQ are in a consolidation at this stage, most likely because the heavy data and earnings releases are not out until mid-week and the Fed Meeting is two days with the decision due Wednesday. This leadership change and consolidation does nothing more than just switch the offensive players at this stage of this market rally. One market that is under pressure is Crude, CLH11, watch support at the $88 level, if this breaks could look to challenge $85. Just keep an eye on oil as a potential barometer that the expansion is still growing at the pace that we have been seeing over the last four quarters. See you After Hours. The Stocks are broadly higher on a relatively slow news Monday. The economic calendar holds no data and the earnings news was light as well. McDonald's (MCD) is up 31 cents to $75.32 and one of 23 Dow stocks trading higher after reporting in-line profits for the most recent quarter. Alcoa (AA) gained more than 3 percent and is the best gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. AA is higher amid relative strength in some of the cyclical names after a report from the National Association for Business Economics indicated that economists are becoming more upbeat about the prospects for jobs and the economy. Meanwhile, JC Penney (JCP) gained 7 percent after announcing job reductions and other cost-cutting measures. The Dow is up 86 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ has added 25.5. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX), which rallied 17 percent last week, lost .55 to 17.92. Trading in the options mart remains active, with 4.7 million calls and 3.5 puts traded through 12:15pm ET. Bullish Flow AMD has added a nickel to $7.59 and trying to battle back from a 6 percent post-earnings loss suffered Friday. Meanwhile, trading in AMD options is very active. 61,000 calls and 2,280 puts have traded on the chipmaker through mid-session. The top trade is a block of 16,400 AMD March 8 calls at the 34 cents. Meanwhile, February 8 calls are the most actives. Several large blocks traded at the 19-cent asking price in morning trading. 32,250 contracts have now changed hands and it appears that some investors are taking bullish position, looking for a move beyond $8 by the February options expiration. RadioShack (RSH) trades down $1.86 to $15.75 after the electronics retailer guided its fourth quarter earnings below expectations and also announced that Julian Day would retire as chairman. Shares are reeling on the news and options volume is up. 7,820 calls and 8,045 puts changed hands in RSH so far which is 6X the average daily. Not all of the options action is bearish, however. In fact, the top trade of the day is a block of 2,048 April 17 calls at 64 cents each on the International Securities Exchange [ISE], which was an opening customer buyer, according to ISEE data. Bearish Flow TIVO adds 21 cents to $9.77 after the company announced a deal with Charter Communications to deliver on-demand services. In options action, a noteworthy trade Monday is a March 9 – 12 risk-reversal bought at 28 cents, 8000X. In this play, the strategist bought 8,000 March 9 puts at 93 cents and sold 8,000 March 12 calls at 65 cents. This options combination might be a straight bearish bet or possibly a hedge (collar) around an existing stock position. Basic Materials Select Sector Fund (XLB) adds 55 cents to $38.03 and options volume is running 2X the average daily, driven by increasing action in February 36 puts. 44,560 contracts have changed hands. The action includes blocks at the 41-cent asking price in morning action and appears to be opening put buying. An institutional investor seeking to hedge their exposure to the materials sector might have initiated the trades. Or, it might be straight bearish trading. Unusual Volume Halliburton (HAL) options volume is running 5X the average daily, with 79,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 74 percent of the volume, according to data from WhatsTrading.com. AMD options volume is 2.5X the average daily, with 63,000 contracts traded and call volume representing for 97 percent of the activity. Clinical Data (CLDA) options volume is running 11.5X the average daily, with 55,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 90 percent of the activity. Increasing options activity is also being seen in First Solar (FSLR), JC Penney (JPC), and SPDR Regional Banking ETF (KRE). Implied Volatility Mover Clinical Data (CLDA), a Newmont, MA biotechnology company, is trading up $9.27 to $24.30 and options volume surged after the FDA approved the company's antidepressant. Shares jumped and options volume is running 12X the average daily. 53,000 calls and 5,900 puts traded in the name so far. Implied volatility is down 65 percent to 70 now that this company event risk has passed."

2011-02-11,International News Trumps Domestic  02-11-2011,"Cusick's Corner It was quite an end to an eventful week. Next week could be a big week in the markets with Retail Sales due out pre-market on Monday -- watch the Retailers, XRT, want to see if this weather is cooling down store activity. Housing data also gets a small push Monday with the NAHB due out at 10am ET. At the end of the day, international events trumped any domestic news. I am still trying to soak in all of these quickly changing world events and will be watching these developments with great interest. Have a good weekend. Stock market averages are holding gains Friday on news Egypt's Hosni Mubarak has stepped down. The underlying tone of trading was cautious early after Mubarak said late-Thursday that he would remain in power until September elections. The defiance raised some concern about escalating violence and unrest in Egypt, as well as other parts of the Arab world. Yet, anxiety levels eased after news agencies reported Friday that the Egyptian leader has now relinquished his power. Meanwhile, the domestic news of the day included the latest Trade Balance data: at -$40.6 billion in December, which was in-line with expectations. Separate data released later showed the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index up to 75.1 in February; which was better than the 74.2 in late January, but below economist estimates of 75.5. Bullish Flow Office Depot (ODP) sees some unusual volume Friday. Shares of the office supplies retailer are trading up 20 cents to $6 even and options volume is 9X the average daily. 14,000 calls and 1,000 puts traded so far. March 6 calls are the most actives and the action includes multiple blocks traded at 35 cents when the market was 25 to 35 cents. 9,630 traded total. Since open interest is 1,651 and most (96 percent) traded at the Ask, it looks like call buyers were initiating the trades and looking for ODP to move higher over the next five weeks. It's possibly a play on earnings, due February 22. Bullish order flow was also seen in Abbott Labs (ABT), IMAX, and Waste Management (WM). Bearish Flow Virgin Media (VMED) is seeing some pre-earnings put activity today. Shares are performing well, gaining 76 cents to $27.35. Meanwhile, 5,020 puts and 1,090 calls traded on the British media company. February 26 puts are the most actives. March 26 and February 30 puts are seeing interest as well. Implied volatility is up 3 percent to 34 and some investors might be initiating put purchase to hedge the stock (or make outright bearish bets) ahead of the company's earnings, due next Thursday. Bearish flow also picked up in Corning (GLW), Nokia (NOK), and AstraZeneca (AZN). Index Trading CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) eased a bit this week. Although the volatility index rose in three of this week's five trading days, it is down .37 to 15.72 today and off .21 since a week ago. Moreover, VIX is down 21.6 percent from the multi-month highs beyond 20 seen two weeks ago. On Friday, January 28, VIX surged after violence escalated in Egypt and other parts of the Arab world. The event triggered worries that these events might have a global economic impact and create an earnings risk to US corporations. However, those fears have eased during the past two weeks and the trend continued Friday after Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak stepped down. ETF Trading Basic Materials Select Sector Fund (XLB) puts are busy Friday. Shares touched a new 52-week high of $40.07 Monday and are up 32 cents to $39.95 Friday. Meanwhile, 54,000 puts have traded in the fund. Buyers of June 37 puts surfaced early. More than 30,000 contracts now traded. June 38 puts are being bought as well. XLB is one of nine select sector funds that collectively hold all of the S&P 500 stocks, but grouped by economic sector. By buying puts on XLB, an investor is making a bet against the companies that are involved in the basic materials space, like metals, mining and minerals companies. An institutional investor looking to hedge exposure to that sector of the market might be initiating some of these trades."
2011-02-17,Short-Term Technicals Extended  02-17-2011,"Cusick's Corner The S&P is up 4% so far this month and it's on a 9 session winning streak of finishing in the green. This leaves short-term technicals a little extended but it looks like there are no signals of this developing into pressure on the current bullish trend. If you watched the overnight and the open today, things have been on the quiet side even after worse than expected data (higher initial & continuous claims). Geopolitical events have led to a slightly weaker tone but these headlines seem to be giving the bulls a dip for buying. The first support level that could provide a read is the 1330 area in the S&P 500 cash with resistance 1342. See you After Hours. Major averages are holding slim gains following a round of mixed economic news Thursday. Market action was sluggish early after the Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index [CPI] rose .4 percent in January, which was .1 percent more than expected. Separately, the Labor Department reported that weekly jobless claims increased by 25,000 in the period ended February 12, which was roughly in-line with expectations. Later, the List of Leading Indicators came in at .1 percent for January and below economist estimates of .3 percent. However, the Philadelphia Fed Survey of manufacturing activity was a bright spot. It surged to 35.9 in February, from 19.3 last month and significantly better than the 21.0 that economists had expected. Meanwhile, the corporate news is light today. A handful of second tier names, including Weight Watchers (WTW), NVidia (NVDA), Barrick Gold (ABX), and Williams Companies (WMB), are up on earnings. Netapp (NTAP) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) are seeing post-earnings weakness. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 8 points and the NASDAQ gained 4. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) edged up .12 to 16.84 midday. Options trading volumes are running about the typical levels, but will likely pick up this afternoon and tomorrow due to the expiration. 4.9 million calls and 3.5 puts traded through 12:15pm ET Thursday. Bullish Flow Nabor's Industries (NBR), an oil and gas drilling company, is up $1.23 to $27.97 and notched a new 52-week high today. Shares have been rallying since the company reported earnings late-Tuesday and are up 7.9 percent over the past two days. Options action is interesting as well. 18,000 calls and 3,270 puts traded so far, or 3X the recent average daily. The top trade is a lot of 556 March 27 calls at the $1.14 asking price just after the opening bell. It seems to be a well-timed call buy, as the contract is now bid at $1.70. Volume is approaching 8,000 contracts. Family Dollar (FDO) calls are busy, the day after shares rallied on news Nelson Peltz's investment firm made a bid for the retailer. Shares surged 21.1 percent yesterday and are down 50 cents to $52.75 today. Options volume in the retailer is 12,000 calls and 2,850 puts. March 50 calls, which are already in-the-money, are the most actives. 3,575 traded and, with 98 percent trading at the ask, it appears that buyers are dominating the activity. Similar action is being seen in the April 49 calls. Bearish Flow Human Genome Sciences (HGSI) is flat at $26.17 and noteworthy options action is being seen in the company's March 22 puts. 6,300 contracts changed hands so far. 81 percent trading at the ask and open interest is only 468. Some investors or shareholders might be buying puts as a bearish play or to hedge stock ahead of an FDA decision regarding the company's Benlysta lupus drug. The decision was recently delayed from December to March. Basic Materials Select Sector Fund (XLB) shares are trading up 22 cents to $40.56 and notched a new 52-week high today. XLB holds all of the material companies from the S&P 500, which includes metal, chemical and mining names. In options action, one investor bought a block of 25,500 XLB June 41 puts at $2.51 per contract midday today. An institutional investor looking to hedge that sector of the market might have initiated the hefty premium purchase. Unusual Volume NVidia (NVDA) options volume is running 2X the (22-day) average, with 143,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 67 percent of the volume. Williams Companies (WMB) options volume is 3.5X the average daily, with 142,000 contracts traded and call volume representing for 79 percent of the activity. AK Steel (AKS) options volume is running 4X the average daily, with 53,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 92 percent of the activity. Increasing options activity is also being seen in NetApp (NTAP), Brocade (BRCD), and Nabor's (NBR). Implied Volatility Mover Brocade (BRCD) implied volatility is on the move ahead of earnings. Shares have added 32 cents to $6.04 and options volume is triple the recent average daily. 27,000 calls and 12,000 puts traded in the chipmaker. February at-the-money $6 puts and calls are the most actives. Meanwhile, implied volatility has increased by 14 percent to 64.5 ahead of the results, which are due out after the closing bell."
2011-03-11,The ETF Select List Is Here ! And It Stinks!,"Schwab published an ETF Select List of what it describes as the best fund choices for 50 categories. While there is a little utility, for the most part it is worthless.The list seems to be targeted at an Investing 101 or maybe Investing 102 audience. Most of the equity categories are broad and so in choosing the best funds for each broad category many of the funds are from Schwab and bunch more from Vanguard. I'm not critical of the fact that so many Schwab funds are the best pick. I heard an interview on CNBC about this earlier in the week and one purpose here is best choices for Schwab customers. The expense ratios of Schwab's funds are very competitive and there is no commission to trade them at Schwab. In that light where each ETF provider has, for example, a total market funds and the correlation between all of them will be 99 or 100 then why not go with cheapest possible choice?While the above is true it would seem to rule out things like RAFI, WisdomTree, Revenue Shares and probably a couple of other providers who may have built better mousetraps.The sector sections is truly pitiful. Nine of the ten sectors are the Select Sector SPDRs, the only one that isn't is telecom because there isn't a true Sector SPDR for telecom (the SPDR Telecom ETF is brand new, seems to own names not in the SPX and is not cap weighted). For Telecom they have iShares US Telecom (IYZ). Somehow, the methodology ignores a lot of fund families where sectors are concerned.What about PowerShares? The PowerShares Dynamic Energy Sector ETF (PXI) has outperformed XLE since inception, for one year, for two years and for three years. PXI has an expense ration of 0.65% versus 0.20% for XLE. So yes XLE is cheaper and while making a decision based solely on past results is not a great idea, PowerShares probably does deserve a seat at the table.The other thing that is lost here with sector funds is foreign sectors which appear to get no consideration as a category (meaning they might as well not exist) not to mention niche funds that can serve as proxies for sectors. Domestic sector funds can look very different from foreign sectors funds and this becomes very important in portfolio construction.The easiest example here is probably the materials sector. What has been the allure of the sector over the last five years or so? I think one big driver has been mining stocks. The Materials Sector SPDR (XLB) is more about chemical stocks than mining companies. Dupont (DD) and Dow Chemical (DOW) add up to 22% of the fund and there are many other chemical names in the fund. Freeport Mcmoran (FCX) and Newmont (NEM) combine for 20% of the fund, but they appear to be the extent of the mining exposure. There are also a lot of metals producers and depending on the particulars these could be price takers not price makers which would matter to me.A fund like iShares Global Materials (MXI) on the other hand has 56% in mining and it is the miners that dominate the top ten. Some clients own MXI. As another example the EG Shares Emerging Metals and Mining ETF (EMT) appears to have about 70% in mining companies (if you include coal companies). Relative to being the same sector I think the differences in performance are enough to matter but this could be in the eye of the beholder.The country fund section only had two countries; Japan and China. Long time readers will know the importance I place on country selection and by only having two countries Schwab is simply ignoring this segment.The exchange traded product space has vast possibilities for portfolio construction (preferably in conjunction with other products) but the select list doesn't begin to take take advantage of what is out there."
2011-03-11,"Civil Unrest, Contract Roll, Excellent Treasury Auctions, Earthquakes: Who's Winning?","With continuing civil unrest in Libya and fears of contagion into Saudi Arabia, the global financial markets once again had an excuse to be volatile. This past week has probably had more headlines than we have seen in past several months, so combine that with an extended run in equities and commodities and the trends were likely to change, at least in the short run. As equity index futures contracts rolled from March to June this week (volume moves from March contract on Wednesday to June contract on Thursday), weakness ensued. The downward spiral in all asset classes except for the dollar and bonds were amplified on Thursday with news of the Saudi police firing on protestors. The selloff continued into late Thursday night and early Friday after an 8.9 magnitude earthquake rocked Japan. Despite the Asian and European equity markets closing lower, the U.S. markets found strength from a beat up energy sector and material sector (NYSE: XLE (NYSE: XLB) to eek out gains going into the weekend. Yields moved higher this week in U.S. Govt. Treasuries, highlighted by an excellent auction in the 30 year bond. Bill Gross announced on Wednesday of this week Pimco no longer owns any U.S. government securities. With POMO expected to end shortly and the Federal Reserve now the largest holder of treasuries, one certainly might wonder how much longer yields will remain so low. Quad-witching will be the highlight of next week's market activity, and from a historical perspective, odds are that the markets will be volatile. As larger institutions begin to either initiate and/or unwind positions, look for opportunities to capitalize on the volatility."
2011-03-25,ETF Showdown: A Materials Matchup,"Let's be honest: Few investors think that what materials and mining companies do is a sexy business. They don't make smartphones, tablets or operate in the high-growth e-commerce or social networking spheres. Yep, all that is true, but materials stocks, on the other hand, are sexy. High beta produces great intraday moves and the potential for rapid gains (or losses) as the big names in the materials and mining sectors are often found making headlines. And all that does not include the fact these are emerging plays without having to directly buy a particular emerging market. There's no shortage of materials ETFs to take a look at, but the result of today's ETF Showdown, might be a surprise to some. Let's get on with this materials matchup. The Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLB) is squaring off against the iShares S&P Global Materials Index Fund (NYSE: MXI), an ETF we've highlighted several times in the past. Here's the key difference between these ETFs: XLB is a North American play while MXI is globally diverse. Want some exposure to Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) and DuPont (NYSE: DD)? XLB will cover you with a combined weight of over 23% to those names. Put another way, two stocks dominate XLB, which only holds 29 stocks to begin with. On the other hand, MXI is far more diverse. The ETF holds 121 stocks with BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP), the world's largest mining company, the top holding at about 12%. Freeport and DuPont also factor into MXI's top-10, but their weights are far behind the likes of Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) and Vale (NYSE: VALE). At the country level, the U.S. and Canada combine for a third of MXI's weight, but the fund is still more geographically diverse than XLB. XLB has its high points though, including an expense ratio of 0.2% compared to 0.48% for MXI. So what is an investor to do? Consider approaching XLB and MXI this way: The biggest mining companies in the world are typically based outside of the U.S. and you probably want one of BHP, Rio and Vale in your materials portfolio. Of course, there's nothing wrong with a less sexy name like DuPont and Freeport's copper dominance is noteworthy, too. Let's do the math: If you wanted to load up on Vale, BHP, Freeport and DuPont, 100 shares of each would cost about $23,000 give or take a few bucks. By comparison, you can get 200 shares of XLB and 200 shares of MXI for less than $23,000, plus you now have a truly global materials portfolio. Rare as it is, we have a draw in this week's ETF Showdown."
2011-04-19,"3 Commodities ETFs You Used To Like, But Can't Like Now, But Might Be Able To Like Again Later","Things are not well these days across myriad corners of the market. Excluding gold and silver, the same can be said of many commodities and their corresponding ETFs and ETNs. That's led to troublesome declines in ETFs and ETNs that were previously darlings and not just commodities darlings, but in at least one case, a now former broader market superstar. In another case, we have a stealth loser, one whose declines have kind of flown under the radar. In all cases, we have three exchange traded products that you used to love, cannot love right in this moment, but just might be able to warm to again in the medium-term. Let's have a look at this heart-wrenching trio. 1) ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL): PALL topped out just below $85 in February and fell well short of that level at its March peak. Its April high is below both the the February and March highs. In other words, we have a series of lower highs. If PALL breaks $71, a decline to $65 could be in the offing. The Problem: China's car market is slowing. The Solution: Maybe, just maybe, the U.S. economy can rebound enough to spur new car sales and prop up palladium demand and prices. 2) iPath DJ-UBS Cotton TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: BAL): BAL more than tripled from August 2010 through March, perhaps leaving it more vulnerable to a big decline than any other commodities-related ETF or ETN. The Problem(s): Goldman Sachs said take profits in cotton last week. Farmers are planting more cotton to take advantage of higher prices. The Solution(s): Bad weather in cotton-producing regions and some hot hedge fund money into the futures market ought to right this ship, but those are two big X factors. 3) Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB): We wanted to include one equity-based ETF on the list and XLB, our stealth decliner, fits the bill. XLB has been suffering as investors have started to cash in higher-beta fare for more conservative stocks and ETFs. The Problem(s): China's inflation-fighting efforts and weak earnings reports. The Solution: Well, DuPont (NYSE: DD), Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) all report earnings this week, but by the looks of things thus far in earnings season, stocks aren't getting much help. XLB's return to bullish ways may be a bit further off than some would like to admit."
2011-04-19,Trading Turns Mixed  04-19-2011,"Cusick's Corner The newest S&P rating is vetting itself throughout the financial shows, keeping viewers, but the reality is that the US going into default is not a reality. It has put more pressure on politicians but the market knows that the credit markets are not going to shut down. Plus the status of the Buck as a reserve currency is not unwinding today or tomorrow, but spending has been put on notice. Spending also needs to be watched and positioned in the EU debt crisis (which we discussed as an issue last week) and that is what the market reacted to yesterday. The Euro was under pressure and the market has growing concerns that the Banks in the EU are now so debt ridden that this stress is going to put more potential fear and pressure on the large cap Banking stocks. It might be worth adding Gold to your portfolio to mitigate some of these potential risks. You would have to consider the different products that are available too -- gold, the ETF GLD, GCM11 futures outright or miners, like GDX. See you After Hours. Trading has turned mixed Tuesday, with earnings from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) helping to lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average. JNJ is up 2.4 percent and one of 17 Dow stocks heading higher after the company said it earned $1.35 per share in the most recent quarter, which beat Street estimates by 9 cents. Meanwhile, the latest Housing Starts data showed an improvement to 549,000 in March, which was up from 512,000 last month and also better than the 520,000 that economists had expected. The Housing Starts number and J&J's positive results helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 30 points through midday. The NASDAQ lost 1.3 points ahead of earnings from tech bellwether Intel (INTC), due out after the closing bell. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) has given up .84 to 16.12. Overall options volume is light today, with 4.2 million calls and 3.2 million puts traded through 1:15pm ET. Bullish Flow Bank of America (BAC) shares are falling for a sixth day and are off 12 cents to $12.30. Meanwhile, trading in BAC options is very brisk. 230,000 calls and 166,000 puts traded in the bank so far. The biggest trade is a block of 28,000 May 13 calls traded at 17 cents per contract. It was part of a ratio spread, in which the investor sold the May 13 calls and bought 14,000 June 13 call options. The strategist is possibly closing out a position in the May 13s, which are falling nearly 6 percent out-of-the-money, and opening a new smaller position in the June 13s. They might still have a bullish view on the bank, but are buying an additional month for the trade to play out. General Electric adds 24 cents to $20.23 and more than 20,300 Weekly 20 calls traded in GE so far. Since Friday is an exchange holiday, these calls have only two trading days of life remaining after today. It looks like some investors are paying a nickel and are possibly taking bullish positions ahead of earnings. GE is due to release its results Thursday morning. After that, the weekly calls will have one day of life remaining. If shares settle below $21, or 3.8 percent above current levels, those calls will expire worthless. Bearish Flow Pulte Homes (PHM) shares gained 29 cents to $8.13 after the Commerce Department released Housing Starts numbers Tuesday morning. Both the starts and building permits rose more than expected in March. The sector is up on the news. Meanwhile, options volume in PHM is running 5X the average daily. 28,000 calls and 2,100 puts traded. The top trade was a block of 21,000 June 8 calls, which were sold at 54 cents per contract. Since volume exceeds open interest, this appears to be a new position and possibly a bet that shares will drift back below $8 through the June expiration. Ecolab (ECL), a St. Paul, MN cleaning products company, is trading up 44 cents to $51.18 and a noteworthy spread surfaced in midday action. In this trade, the investor bought 19,000 May 50 puts at 85 cents and sold 19,000 May 45 puts at a nickel. They paid a nickel for the spread and are possibly looking for the stock to fall to $45 or less by the May expiration, which is in 31 days. A shareholder might have initiated the spread as a hedge ahead of earnings, due later this month. Unusual Volume GM options volume is running 3.5X the (22-day) average, with 155,000 contracts traded and put volume accounting for about 54 percent of trades. Goldman Sachs (GS) options volume is 2X the average daily, with 100,000 contracts traded and call volume representing for 63 percent of the activity. SPDR Basic Materials (XLB) options volume is running 3.5X the average daily, with 66,000 contracts traded and put volume accounting for 97 percent of the activity. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Valero (VLO), AIG, and Allstate (ALL). Implied Volatility Mover Perfect World (PWRD) shares are rallying and options are actively traded after the company was highlighted favorably in an article titled The Next Great Chinese Stock on a Forbes blog. PWRD surged $3.18 to $28.73 and options volume is 5X the average daily, with 5,360 calls and 800 puts traded in the name. June 31, June 33 and Sep 35 calls are the most actives. Implied volatility is up about 6 percent to 58."

2011-05-03,"Defense, Defense  05-03-2011","Cusick's Corner Defense is in play. The VIX continues higher, 3 up days in a row, Financials (XLF) and Tech (QQQQ) lag and are now well behind Consumer Staples (XLP) and Healthcare (XLV). There's been a rush to Consumer Staples like toothpaste, beverages, soap, and Drugs (not the illegal kind!), makers/distributors, are outperforming the offensive sectors, especially when there's uncertainty on employment and domestic and global GDP growth. This might be a short-term pullback (not totally unhealthy) but this will wash out the weak hands. Out-of-the-money put butterflies are trading (check out Bearish Flow), indicating to me that there are strategists who see high implied volatility and a potential pullback. As a matter of fact, the SPY trade would have full profit if the SPY would pull back 7.4% and that level is the March low and the bottom where the head of the inverse head and shoulders that I spoke about last week formed. See you After Hours. Stocks are trading mixed, as weakness in the commodities markets and unimpressive earnings outweighed a better-than-expected report on Factory Orders. Crude oil is down $1.09 to $112.43 a barrel and gold gave up $14.1 to $1,543 an ounce. Consequently, Exxon Mobile (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are among the Dow's losers through midday. Pfizer (PFE) lost 2.2 percent and is the largest decliner in the industrial average after its earnings failed to live up to Street expectations. Clorox (CLX) and Molson Coors (TAP) are also seeing post-earnings weakness. On the economic front, the only economic stat of the day showed Factory Orders up 3 percent in March, which was much better than the 1.8 percent that economists were expecting. Still, the overall tone of trading remains cautious ahead of key jobs data later this week. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 22 points, the tech-heavy NASDAQ has given up 20.5. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) gained .34 to 16.33. Overall options activity is picking up, with 6.9 million calls and 4.2million puts traded through 12:30pm ET. Bullish Flow Alcoa (AA) has seen a surge in options activity today. Shares are up 2.7 percent to $17.70 and the best gainer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Meanwhile, options volume includes 289,000 calls and 65,000 puts. The May 18 calls, which are 1.7 percent out-of-the-money, are the most actives. 50,000 contracts traded. May 19 and May 20 calls are seeing brisk trading. A Reuters story out Tuesday morning attributes the increased call activity to speculation that Rio Tinto might bid for the aluminum maker. The article notes that sources at two banks said to be financing the deal have denied the speculation. Still, trading in AA calls is brisk in reaction to takeover chatter. Sirius XM Radio (SIRI) touched a new 52-week high today and is up 17 cents to $2.08 after the company posted a quarterly profit of a penny per share, which was in-line with analyst estimates. In options trading, volume is 4X the recent average daily. 59,000 calls and 7,700 puts have traded in the name so far. June 2 calls, which are now 8 cents in-the-money, are the most actives. 13,940 traded. May 2, June 2, January 1, and January 2 calls are seeing interest as well. Bearish Flow SPDR 500 Trust (SPY) loses 43 cents to $135.79 and a noteworthy spread traded in the ETF today. In this trade, the investor sold 42,000 June 125 puts at 60 cents. They also bought 21,000 June 130 puts at $1.21 and bought 21,000 June 120 puts at 34 cents. In other words, they bought the June 120 - 125 - 130 put butterfly spread at 35 cents, 21000X. The spread has traded more than once today. It's a bearish play or perhaps hedging activity. The spread offers a max pay-off if shares fall to $125 through the June expiration, which represents an 8 percent decline in the S&P 500 over the next 45 days. Silver Wheaton (SLW) shares are down 38 cents to $37.40 after silver tumbled $3.35 to $42.74 an ounce Tuesday. Meanwhile, 56,000 calls and 21,000 puts traded in the Vancouver-based silver miner. January 40 calls, which are now 7 percent out-of-the-money, are the most actives. 4,870 traded and, with 75 percent traded on the bid, it looks like call writers are dominating the trade.

Sirius XM Satellite Radio (SIRI) options volume is 3.5X the average daily, with 59,000 contracts traded and call volume representing for 88 percent of the activity. Eli Lilly (LLY) options volume is running 2.5X the average daily, with 29,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 80 percent of the activity.

2011-05-03,XLE The Clear Sector Leader,"In a retirement account, Sector investing can be very worthwhile. It can lead to portfolio returns that “beat the market”. Sectors offer a way of focusing, in a disciplined fashion, similar to looking at Countries, or broad markets. At any given point in time, one or more sectors may be out performing other sectors, and the broad stock market. Portfolios that include Sector allocation can capture this performance. A great way to get sector exposure is through exchange traded funds. Today, there are numerous 'sector' type exchange traded funds that you can invest in. The iShares and the SPDR lineups are probably the two most popular. However there are several other providers that offer unique and interesting sector and industry ETFs.

With all of the headline news lately, it is no surprise that the Energy Sector ETFs are the strongest. The holdings inside the ETFs usually include the large cap oil companies such as Exxon and Chevron, and, some of the smaller cap companies. When crude oil, and petroleum product prices rise, usually the margins of the oil companies expand. An example could be the cost of production of a barrel of crude stays relatively fixed, as the selling price of the barrel of crude goes higher. Similarly, some of the costs of refining a gallon of gasoline stay relatively fixed, as the selling price of that gallon goes higher. These energy sector ETFs are definitely on my retirement portfolio watch list this year.

2011-05-04,China Slowdown Slides Market  05-04-2011,"Cusick's Corner Support -- that is what the market is looking at into the Midday and After Hours sessions. This pullback is not the surprising but if support is not held, 134 in the SPY, a drive to April lows are in the sights of the bears. Volatility has not popped on the pullback today but it has been on the rise, so hedging could become more expensive if the market starts to challenge these support levels. See you After Hours. Stocks are broadly lower on disappointing economic data Wednesday. ADP reported this morning that the US economy added 179,000 private sector jobs last month. Economists were predicting an increase of 200,000. The news comes two days before the Labor Department releases its key monthly payroll report. Separate data released later Wednesday showed the ISM Services Index falling to 52.8 in April, down from 57.3 and well below economist estimates of 57.4. Meanwhile, commodities are under pressure again today. Crude oil lost $2.13 to $108.92 per barrel and gold gave up $30.2 to $1,510.20 an ounce. Within the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Chevron Texaco (CVX) and Exxon (XOM) are moving lower along with crude oil. Some of the cyclical names, DuPont (DD), Caterpillar (CAT), and Alcoa (AA), are among the Dow's biggest losers. The industrial average is down 125 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 30. The CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) gained .87 to 17.57. Trading in the options market is active and clearly more defensive than in recent days, with 5.3 million calls and 5.3 million puts traded through 12:30pm ET. Bullish Flow STEC, the Santa Ana, CA data storage device maker, is seeing relative strength and bullish options order flow today. Shares are up 4.1 percent to $20.20. Meanwhile, 9,530 calls and 565 puts have traded in the name. The August 18 calls, which are 12.2 percent in-the-money, are the most actives. 7,300 traded and it looks like some investors are paying $3.70 to open new positions. Open interest is only 64 contracts. August 26 calls are seeing interest as well. The strength in the stock and increasing call buying in STEC is noteworthy, as other names in the space (SNDK, STX, WDC) are trading lower today. STEC is due to release earnings on May 10. SPDR Gold Trust (GLD), which is an exchange-traded fund that holds the yellow metal, is down $2.81 to $147.07 after gold lost $30.2 to $1,510.20 an ounce. GLD has now suffered a three-day 3.5 percent slide. One options trader seems to view the weakness as an opportunity for a bullish trade. In midday action, a May 150 - 155 call spread was initiated on the fund. The investor paid 78 cents per spread to buy 10,000 May 150 calls at $1.02 and sell 10,000 May 155 calls at 24 cents. It's a bold move, as the May 150 calls are now 2 percent out-of-the-money and May options expire in two and a half weeks. Bearish Flow An interesting three-way spread trades in the SPDR 500 Trust (SPY) Wednesday. Shares are down $1.11 to $134.62 and have now suffered a three-day 1.4 percent setback. In options action, one spread trader apparently sold 20,000 May 130 puts at 35 cents to buy 20,000 June 122 - 132 put spreads at $1.35. Therefore, they paid $1 for the three-way and might be looking for SPY to hold above $130 through the May expiration, but then fall from that point forward. Or, they might have rolled a position - closing out May to open a new bearish position in June. Murphy Oil (MUR), an Eldorado, AR oil and gas refiner, is trading down $2 to $72.63 after crude gave up $2.13 to $108.92 per barrel Wednesday. Meanwhile, options volume in Murphy includes 6,225 puts and 870 calls. May 70 puts, which are 3.5 percent out-of-the-money and expire in 16 days, are the most actives. Volume is approaching 5,000 contracts and 82 percent traded at the ask, which indicates put buying. It's possibly bearish trading or hedging activity ahead of earnings. The company is due to report today, but a time has not been specified. Unusual Volume Las Vegas Sands (LVS) options volume is running 2X the (22-day) average, with 183,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for about 54 percent of trades. Gap Stores (GPS) options volume is 10.5X the average daily, with 54,000 contracts traded and call volume representing for 92 percent of the activity. First Solar (FSLR) options volume is running 2.5X the average daily, with 52,000 contracts traded and call volume accounting for 51 percent of the activity. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Macy's (M), El Paso (EP), and SPDR Basic Materials ETF (XLB). Implied Volatility Mover Gap Stores (GPS) implied volatility is elevated amid heavy trading in the options market today. Shares of the apparel retailer hit a morning high of $23.73 and were recently up 29 cents to $23.22. Options volume is running more than 10X the average daily, amid heavy trading in May and June 24 and 25 calls. Total volume is 49,000 calls and 4,540 puts. Meanwhile, implied volatility is up 17 percent to 35."
2011-06-01,Financials and Materials Among Worst Sectors Today; Both Down Over 2.5%,

2011-06-13,Tech Lags  06-09-2011,"Cusick's Corner As I said in the past few Corners, a bounce here is not unexpected, especially after the pounding that has been going on the last 6 sessions. What is concerning me is that Tech was the real laggard today, and some might say it is about time. But I watch offensive sectors closely, Finance/Consumer Discretionary etc., to see if any push could get tired quickly. The data was not a game changer and was not giving any wind to either the Bulls or the Bears. I would not be surprised to see a grind into tomorrow and expiration next week. Also for S&P futures traders the new front month is now September. There will be no After Hours tomorrow as I will be traveling. See you Midday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average snapped a 6-day losing streak, but finished off session highs Thursday. Economic data was in focus early after the Labor Department reported that jobless claims increased by 5,000 to 427,000 in the first week of June. Economists were looking for an increase of just 1,000. A separate report showed the nation's trade deficit at $43.7 billion in April. Economists were expecting the deficit to widen to $48.7 billion from $48.2 billion. A third stat released later was a report on wholesale inventories, which was up .8 percent in April and not far from economist estimates. Stocks rallied in morning trading and, after a six-day 521-point slide, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had tallied a 120-point gain through midday. From that point forward, there wasn't much news to guide the market and the Dow drifted lower in the second half of trading. At the closing bell, the industrial average was up 75 points and 59 points below its best levels of the day. The tech-heavy NASDAQ added 9.5 points. Bullish Flow Goodyear Tire (GT) shares rolled 7 cents higher to $16.06 and options on the tire-maker were actively traded Thursday 11,000 calls and 12,000 puts traded in Goodyear, which is 4X the average daily. The top trade was a 4,000-contract block of Jun 18 calls that traded at the 5-cent asking price. The contract is 12.1 percent out-of-the-money and expires at the end of next week. An investor might have initiated the trade to close a position. Open interest in the GT Jun 18 call is 7,020 contracts. Separately, blocks of January 12.5 puts traded on the $1.65 bid. At the end of the day, 10,340 of these puts had changed hands. Since open interest is only 911 contracts, the action looks like opening put sales and a bet that shares will hold above $12.5 through the January expiration. If not, the put sellers could face assignment and be asked to buy the stock at that price level. June 16, June 17 and July 15 calls on Goodyear were actively traded today as well. Bullish trading was also seen in BofA (BAC), Titanium Metals (TIE), and Eldorado Gold (EGO). Bearish Flow Liz Claiborne (LIZ) shares gained 10 cents to $5.54 and options order flow seemed somewhat bearish today, as 7,450 puts and 300 calls traded in the retailer. June 5 puts, which are almost 10 percent out-of-the-money and expire in 8 days, were the most actives. Most of the action surfaced in afternoon trading and included lots on the 10 and 15-cent asking price. At the end of the day, 6,527 traded and 98 percent of the volume was at the offer. Open interest is only 33 contracts and so today's put buying looks opening. July 5 puts saw interest as well. It's not clear what was driving the bearish trading because there was no news on the retailer, but the put buying seems to reflect some concerns about the risk of short-term weakness in LIZ shares. Bearish flow also surfaced in Melco Crown Entertainment (MPEL), Ciena (CIEN), and Skechers (SKX). Index Trading Trading was relatively quiet in the index pits, as market averages rebounded Thursday. The S&P 500 Index (.SPX) added 9.44 points to 1,289.00. Meanwhile, 526,000 calls and 515,000 puts traded on the SPX, S&P 100 Index (.OEX), and other cash indexes, which is about 90 percent the recent average daily volume, according to Trade Alert data. S&P 500 Index June 1,300 calls were the most actives. The contract is now .85 percent out-of-the-money and stops trading in one week. 33,100 traded. Some investors were possibly taking bullish positions in the calls on hopes for a short-term pop on the S&P over the next week. Others might have been closing out positions. Open interest in the SPX June 1,300 calls is 145,745 contracts. ETF Trading SPDR Basic Materials ETF (XLB) added 62 cents to $38.07and recovered some of the 5.8 percent loss suffered during the first six trading days in June. Options volume in the ETF was 40,000 puts and 5,275 calls. The top trades were part of a spread, in which the investor bought 10,000 September 35 puts at 91 cents each and sold 20,000 September 30 puts at 23 cents. Therefore, they paid 45 cents for this 1X2 put ratio spread. The position pays off if XLB shares fall below $34.55 through the expiration. An institutional investor might have initiated the spread to hedge exposure to the basic materials sector of the market. The 45 cent debit is at risk if shares hold above $35 and there is additional risk to the downside because only half of the 30 puts are covered by the 35s."
2011-06-22,Uninspired  06-22-2011,"Cusick's Corner Uninspired - that's the type of action that we saw slipping into the evening. The Fed Chief spoke and the market held then pulled off in the last hour. This also coincided with the strength in the Dollar, DXU11 75.25, bouncing off the 21-Day Moving Average and the highest volume levels in S&P Futures during that final hour. I held my short deltas into the announcement, resistance held at 1292 and there was little interest in the dips. The market is sitting right off first level of support, 1280 on spot and 1284 on cash S&Ps, going into the overnight session, especially since the Fed Chief was pretty animate about no need for further QE. Watch the overnight markets, China will have data on manufacturing and given the tone of data that has been coming out from the EU and here at home, any positive surprise could be the spark that the bulls did not see today. See you Midday. Stock market averages fell during the final ninety minutes of trading and finished with losses Wednesday. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NASDAQ were little changed at midday and ahead of the Federal Reserve's post-meeting statement. With little news flow to guide the morning action, the tone of trading took a wait-and-see feel ahead of the news. The post-meeting text started making the rounds at 12:30pm ET and Fed officials didn't offer much new information. Economic growth forecasts for this year and next were slashed. Few clues about future monetary policy were offered. Some investors had hoped the Federal Reserve would signal plans for another round of quantitative easing. It was not to be. Consequently, some disappointment set in and the Dow sold off during the second half of trading. At the closing bell, the industrial average was down 80 points and near the session lows. The tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 18. Bullish Call options on KB Homes (KBH) were busy today ahead of a report on New Home Sales. The data will be released Thursday morning. KBH shares added 13 cents to $11.83 ahead of the news and options volume was 2X the average daily for the homebuilder. 10,000 calls and 900 puts traded in the name. August 12 calls, which are now 17 cents out-of-the-money, were the day's most actives in KBH. More than 5,000 contracts traded. August 15 and July 12 calls saw brisk trading as well. KB Homes shares have rallied 12.34 percent since June 10. Today's call buyers might be looking for the New Home Sales to serve as a catalyst that sends the stock higher still. Bullish trading was also seen in Beazer Homes (BZH), Emerson Electric (EMR), and Bed, Bath and Beyond (BBBY). Bearish Campbell Soup (CPB) has seen two days of bearish trading. July and August 34 puts were the most actives yesterday. Shares lost 24 cents to $33.98 today and July 33 puts saw the most volume. 7,680 contracts traded against open interest of 576 contracts. The contract, which is 2.9 percent out-of-the-money and expires in 23 days, traded at an average price of 24.5 cents. Today's heightened activity was apparently driven by a (unconfirmed) brokerage recommendation to buy July 33 puts ahead of the soup company's Analyst Day, which is slated for July 12 and inside the expiration. Bearish flow also surfaced in Hyperdynamics (HDY), RF Micro Devices (RFMD), and Allscripts (MDRX). Index Trading The European-style S&P 100 Index (.XEO) saw more volume than usual. XEO is an index that tracks the same stocks as the S&P 100, or OEX (Notice that the ticker is OEX backwards). The only difference between the two indexes is in the way the options settle. OEX options settle American-style and can be exercised (assigned) at any time prior to the options expiration. Like most other index products, XEO options are European-style and exercise (assignment) can only happen at the expiration. Some investors were showing interest in the European-style index today, as 8,450 puts and 1,650 calls traded on the XEO. The index lost 3.88 to 572.46 and most of the volume was due to put spread trading in the Weekly options that expire 6/24. ETF Action Basic Materials Select Sector Fund (XLB) erased early gains and lost 15 cents to $37.74 on the day. A noteworthy options trade surfaced in the ETF after an investor bought 16,900 July 39 calls at 47 cents and sold 16,900 July 37 puts at 44 cents. They paid 3 cents for this bullish risk-reversal and appear to be opening a new position. The combo traded more than once and volume in both contracts surpassed 30,000. It's a bold move, as the calls are 3.3 percent out-of-the-money and expire in three and half weeks. In addition, if shares fall below $37 through the expiration, the strategist will be on the hook to buy 100 XLB shares at $37 per every put contract that is sold."
2011-06-30,Window Dressing  06-30-2011,"Cusick's Corner The shopping continues today. Seems like the big money managers are continuing to improve their window, dressing up their end of the month to keep the statement in the green. This is money that is already in the market, but this recent move has scared the managers and hedge funds that have been cash heavy, forcing them to jump into the market. I have written before that you need a select a control, barometer, or benchmark that you want your portfolio's performance to beat. Right now under invested, lagging fund managers are scrambling to get vested. This is the current catalyst but we need to watch these recent buyers, headlines impact these bids rather quickly and using spreads can strategically help mitigate premium and volatility fluctuations. See you After Hours. Stock market averages are broadly higher with help from stronger-than-expected economic data Thursday. The tone of trading on Wall Street remained positive early after European stock benchmarks posted another day of gains. UK's FTSE helped pace the advance with a 1.5 percent gain. Meanwhile, the euro is up another .6 percent on the dollar after Greek parliament passed a second austerity bill designed to prevent debt default. In the US, focus shifted to the Chicago PMI at 10:00am ET. The gauge of regional manufacturing activity showed a surprise jump to 61.6 in June, from 56.6 the month before and significantly better than the 54 that was expected. The report holds some sway, as it comes the day before ISM releases its gauge of nationwide manufacturing activity Friday. End-of-quarter window dressing is a factor today as well. Consequently, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 137 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ is up 31.1. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) is off 1.17 to 16.10. Trading is active as players close the books on the second quarter. 4.3 million calls and 4.1 million puts traded through 12:00pm ET. Bullish Flow NetApp (NTAP) shares are rallying and options on the data storage software maker are busy today. NTAP has added $2.69 to $52.65 and options volume is 2X the average daily. 16,000 calls and 5,630 puts traded in NetApp so far. July 52.5 calls, which were 5.1 percent out-of-the-money prior to today, are the most actives. 6,100 of these now in-the-money calls have traded. July 50 and 55 calls are busy as well. The July contract expires two weeks from tomorrow and the heavy trading in these short-dated options, and the rally in NetApp shares, is being attributed to comments made at the company's Analyst Day. The event is happening today. First Solar (FSLR) is rallying today after the company secured conditional loan guarantees worth $4.5 billion from the Department of Energy. Shares of the solar-panel manufacturer are up $8.17 to $137.59. Meanwhile, options volume is 27,000 calls and 23,000 puts. Typical options volume in FLSR at midday is 13,000 contracts. July 140 calls, which are now 1.8 percent out-of-the-money, are the most actives. 5,240 have changed hands. July 155 and August 145 calls are seeing brisk trading as well. On the put side of the options chain, the July 135s and August 125s are the most actives. Bearish Flow Select Sector Basic Materials ETF (XLB) was the subject of a sizeable bearish trade today. Shares are up 41 cents to $39.31 and an investor bought 20,000 XLB August 37 puts at 59 cents. They also sold 40,000 August 34 puts at 22 cents. Therefore, they paid 15 cents for this 1X2 put ratio spread. Since volume exceeds open interest in both contracts, the spread appears to be a new position. If so, it's a bearish play that makes its best profits if shares fall to $34 at the August expiration, which represents a 13.5 percent decline in XLB shares over the next 50 days. The fund holds all of the basic material names from the S&P 500, including Alcoa, Dow Chemical, Monsanto and a host of others. CF Industries (CF) is under pressure today amid sector weakness after USDA crop data sent the prices of many agricultural commodities sharply lower Thursday morning. CF, which manufacturers fertilizer products, is down $6.30 to $143.05. Options volume is 11,000 calls and 8,100 puts, which is 2.5X the typical volume for the name. July 150 calls, which have fallen $6.95 out-of-the-money and expire in 15 days, are the most actives. 1,915 traded. Since 72 percent of the volume has been on the bedside of the bid-ask spread, it appears that call sellers are driving the flow. Similar action is being seen in July 140 calls. Unusual Volume Hewlett Packard (HPQ) options volume is running 2X the (22-day) average, with 62,000 contracts traded and call activity accounting for 44 percent of the volume. First Solar (FLSR) options volume is 2X the average daily, with 49,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 54 percent of the activity. Dendreon (DNDN) options volume is running 3.5X the average daily, with 24,000 contracts traded and put volume representing 58 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Nordstrom (JWN), DR Horton (DHR), and Tellabs (TLAB). Implied Volatility Mover USEC (USU), the uranium producer, implied volatility is easing. Shares are rallying today, up 7.5 percent to $3.24, after the company reached an agreement with strategic investors. The move is expected to help the company fund a plant project in Piketon, OH. Shares are up and options volume in USU through midday is 9,540 puts and 2,275 calls. Put sellers appear to be active in the name, as implied volatility in USU options is down about 19 percent to 112.5."

2011-09-14,"He Said, She Said - Sarkozy & Merkel 09-14-2011","Cusick's Corner They are meeting, no they're not , yes they are, all referring to the German-French-US meeting, today's headlines have been driving the close in the EU and pushing US markets to the highs of the day. The market has hit stiff resistance, 1180 on the S&Ps, so the upside is in play but there is nothing concrete about the EU and solutions, add to the fact we have options expiration and traders will start to make adjustments as Thursday and Friday closes in on us. I think that today and tomorrow you need to have a game plan, whether it is rolls or close outs, these exit strategies need to be in motion. Do not wait until Thursday or Friday. See you After Hours. Stock market averages opened steady and are holding modest gains midday. Steady trading across the Eurozone helped set a positive tone for morning trading on Wall Street. Germany's DAX helped pace the advance and gained 3.4 percent ahead of a teleconference between French, German and Greek officials intended to help avoid a default by Greece. On the domestic economic front, data showed the Producer Price Index [PPI] unchanged in August, which was in-line with expectations, and business inventories rose .4 percent in July, and also as-expected. However, Retail Sales were flat last month. Economists had predicted an increase of .2 percent. Meanwhile, crude oil lost $1.25 to $88.96 on bearish inventory data and Dell Computer (DELL) is in the spotlight after announcing plans to increase its stock buyback program by $5 billion. Overall, the news flow has failed to trigger much volatility so far today. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 42 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ has added 21.5 points. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) lost 1.4 to 35.51 amid slow trading in the options market. 4.2 million calls and 4.3 million puts traded across the exchanges through 12:30pm ET. Bullish Flow Calls on Yahoo (YHOO) are actively traded today. Shares have added 25 cents to $14.51 ahead of a company meeting to discuss new executive leadership at the company. Yahoo was in the spotlight last week after the Internet giant ousted CEO Carol Bartz. Players in the options market have been active in Yahoo since that time in anticipation of the stock's next potential move. 103,000 calls and 18,000 puts have already traded in the name today. September 15 calls, which are 3.4 percent out-of-the-money and expiring at the end of the week, are the most actives. 22,300 traded. October 16 and 17 calls on Yahoo are seeing brisk trading as well. United Continental (UAL) shares have had a good week. Shares rallied 7.4 percent yesterday after the company updated its capacity plans at a Deutsche Bank conference. UAL is up 44 cents to $19.72 today and on a three-day 11.2 percent run higher. Today's options volume in the airliner is 3X the daily average, with 28,000 calls and 6,060 puts traded on the ticker so far. September 20 calls, which are 28 cents out-of-the-money and expire in three days, are the most actives. 20,265 contracts have changed hands so far. Bearish Flow Freeport McMoran (FCX) loses 54 cents to $41.46 and options volume on the copper and gold miner is running 2X the daily average. 62,000 puts and 39,000 calls traded in the name so far. The top trade is a spread, in which the strategist apparently bought 10,000 October 40 puts at $2.25 and sold 10,000 September 43 puts at $1.81. In other words, they initiated a Sep 43 - Oct 40 put spread for a 36-cent net debit and are possibly rolling a bearish position, or hedge, out one month and from in-the-money to out-of-the-money puts. The spread has traded 21000X so far. First Solar (FSLR) sees interesting spread trading today. Shares are down 51 cents to $90.41 and one strategist apparently sold the October 65 - 70 put spread on FLSR at 50 cents and sold the October 90 - 95 call spread at $2. In other words, they initiated an Oct 65 - 70 - 90 - 95 iron condor for a $2.50 net credit. The trade can be viewed as selling an Oct 70 - 90 strangle and buying the Oct 65 - 95 strangle as a hedge. It's not necessarily a bearish play, but a bet that shares will hold between 70 and 90 through the October expiration. Unusual Volume SPDR Basic Materials ETF (XLB) options volume is running 3X the (22-day) average, with 96,000 contracts traded and put activity accounting for 93 percent of the volume. SiverCorp Metals (SVM) options volume is 2.5X the average daily, with 65,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 53 percent of the activity. Ciena (CIEN) options volume is running 2.5X the average daily, with 45,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 88 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Virgin Media (VMED), Blackstone (BX), and Staples (SPLS) Implied Volatility Mover Longer-dated puts on the iPath VIX Short-term Futures Fund (VXX) are seeing interest today. Shares, which are designed to track market volatility through VIX futures contracts, have been ripping higher in August and September. VXX is up 93 percent since July. However, shares are down 65 cents to $45.19 today and on a two-day 9.1 percent losing skid. Options trades in the ETF today include a 40,000-contract block of January2013 30 puts at $6.65 per contract, which looks like a buyer bracing for additional losses in the ETF and falling levels of market volatility through January 2013."
2011-09-14,Market Velocity  09-14-2011,"Cusick's Corner As I noted earlier this week, I felt that velocity was more to the upside than the downside and today it has played out that way. While there could be challenges to 1200 on the S&Ps, new resistance, I would be apprehensive placing much in the way of upside exposure -- the economic uncertainty in US and EU has put enough fear so that holding cash is the position of choice, which makes the derivative trade pick up. I continue to view volatility as expensive, VIX pulled back -2.31, and I am looking at spread trades. If bullish, consider using in-the-money call spreads or trading OTM butterflies and I would be looking at Oct now. If bearish, consider buying out-of-the-money call calendars, ITM call butterflies. Visit our Education Center -- there are strategy pathways to help you learn more about the right strategy for the right environment. Watch the Claims, CPI data followed by the Production numbers, if either number disappoints, recovery and inflation or lack thereof could put pressure on the market, taking the wind out of the sails. See you After Hours. Stock market averages opened steady and rallied in afternoon trading to close with solid gains Wednesday. Much attention remains on Europe. The euro gained .5 percent against the buck and Germany's DAX added 3.4 percent ahead of a teleconference between French, German and Greek officials. The talks were focused on helping avoid a default by Greece. In the US, economic included data released before the opening bell that showed the Producer Price Index [PPI] unchanged in August, which was in-line with expectations. Meanwhile, Business Inventories rose .4 percent in July, and also as-expected. However, Retail Sales were flat last month. Economists had predicted an increase of .2 percent. Stocks were modestly higher on the mixed data through midday. Then, news Wednesday afternoon that France's Sarkozy and Germany's Merkel reaffirmed support for Greece sent stock market averages to their best levels of the day. At its afternoon highs, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 280 points. It fell off its best levels in the final twenty minutes, however, and closed the day up 141 points. The tech-heavy NASDAQ added 40. Bullish Staples (SPLS) shares were up today after the company's board approved a $1.5 billion stock buyback plan. Shares of the office supplies retailer added 51 cents to $14.60 and are on a three-day 7.6 percent run higher. Meanwhile, options volume in SPLS hit 3X the daily average Wednesday. 42,000 calls and 7,000 puts traded in the name - a ratio of six-to-one. The top trades were in the January 2013 $15 calls, as large blocks traded at the $2.30 and $2.35 asking price. September 15 calls, which are now 1.7 percent out-of-the-money and expiring in two days, were the most actives. 15,930 traded. Investors were apparently buying both short-term and longer-term $15 upside calls on the news, probably hoping that the buyback announcement will spark additional gains in Staples in the days ahead. Bullish trading was also seen in Ciena (CIEN), Oshkosh (OSK), and Riverbed Technology (RVBD). Bearish A large block of calls trades in New York-based apparel clothing maker Ralph Lauren (RL) today. Shares touched new 52-week highs Wednesday and finished the day up $4.73 to $143.22. Options volume in RL was more than 5X the daily average. 17,000 calls and 6,270 puts traded in the name. The top trade was a block of 9,000 October 155 calls at $1.70. At the end of the day, almost 10,000 traded against 342 in open interest. Some investors were apparently selling-to-open new positions in these upside calls. It's not necessarily a bearish play, but a bet that the stock won't rally beyond $155 (8.2%) through the October expiration (37 days). A shareholder might have initiated the sale against stock as part of a buy-write or covered call strategy. Bearish trading was also seen in Virgin Media (VMED), Rackspace (RAX), and Sunpower Tech (STP). Index Trading Trading volume is picking up in the index market heading into the options expiration. September is quarterly quadruple witch expiration - a time when options, futures, futures options, and single stock options all expire. 890,000 calls and 1.1 million puts traded across the S&P 500 Index (.SPX), NASDAQ Index (.NDX) and other cash indexes today. Since the settlement values for many (not all) index products is computed Friday morning, the Last Trade Day is Thursday before the expiration. Consequently, options volume often jumps midweek before the contracts expire. Today is no exception, with 524,000 calls and 783,000 puts traded in the SPX options pit on the CBOE today. The index gained 15.81 to 1,188.68 and Sep 1,200 calls, which are 1 percent out-of-the-money and have one trading day of life remaining, were the most actives. 61,340 contracts traded on the day. ETF Action SPDR Basic Materials Fund (XLB) adds 52 cents to $34.01 today and is up 3.2 percent since Monday. Options on the ETF saw noteworthy trading today. 105,000 puts and 11,000 calls traded on the fund. October 32 puts were the most actives. 50,100 traded. Another 40,000 September 36 puts changed hands. The activity might have included some rolling activity. That is, investors were closing out positions in XLB Sep 36 puts, which are $2 in-the-money and expiring later in the week. Meanwhile, they're buying October 32 puts, which are $2 out-of-the-money and expiring in 37 days. XLB is a fund that holds all of the basic material names from the S&P 500 and includes names like Alcoa, DuPont, and Monsanto. Shares are down 10.5 percent since July and today's rolling activity possibly reflects expectations for additional weakness through October."

2011-09-27,Playing Vol Conservatively  09-27-2011,"Cusick's Corner I mentioned last night that I was looking for fixed risk and reward options strategies that were conservative. One of those strategies to consider is an in-the-money bull call spread. This is a strategy where you buy the in-the-money call and sell another call with a higher strike price, creating a bull call spread which takes advantage of high volatility and bullish sentiment. This position already has intrinsic value because the option that I am long is in-the-money. Plus I have mitigated the premium I paid (which was high because of volatility) by selling another call with equally high volatility. Here's an example: XYZ stock is trading at $28, trader is bullish and volatility in the underlying was high, say 2X historic. A trader could look to buy the 22 strike calls for $6 and sell the 25 strike calls for $3.50, creating a net debit of $2.50 ($250 per spread contract). The risk of this entire trade is $250 and the reward is $50 but the stock needs to stay above $25. This gives you an 11% cushion and you still make your full profit target with a 12.5% cushion before you are break even. For a $250 risk you would potentially make $50, 20% return on risk, with a 12.5% cushion, which meets the bullish conservative options approach with the perspective of high volatility. Stock market averages are posting solid gains for a second day on hopes for a European debt deal. The table was set for morning gains on Wall Street after stocks moved broadly higher across the Eurozone. France's CAC 40 led the advance with a 5.8 percent surge after EU officials discussed various ways to increase the size of rescue funds and to recapitalize European banks. Events overseas again overshadowed the domestic economic news, which included a disappointing reading on Consumer Confidence. The index edged up .2 points to 45.4 in September. Economists were looking for an increase to 46.6. There was a modest negative reaction to the data, but it was short-lived. Through midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has added 271 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ jumped 58 points. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) lost 3.17 to 35.85. Overall options volume is running about the typical levels, with 5.4 million calls and 5.5 million puts traded across the exchanges through 1:00pm ET. Bullish Flow Research In Motion (RIMM) is up $1.32 to $23 and talk activist investor Carl Icahn has taken a stake in the company. The speculation has made the round on several web sites, including Forbes.com. Although there is still no actual evidence Icahn is involved with RIM, the chatter seems to have triggered a flurry of activity in RIM options. 95,000 calls and 34,000 puts have traded on the Blackberry-maker so far. Weekly $23 call options, which expire in four days and are now at-the-money after today's move, are the most actives. 14,290 traded. Weekly 22, Weekly 24, October 24 and October 25 calls on RIM are seeing brisk trading as well. Interdigital (IDCC) shares jumped $3.18 to $52.72 and options on the stock are actively traded after Barrons Online reported the company might be looking to sell all or part of its business. 17,000 calls and 3,780 puts traded on the King of Prussia, PA wireless communications company. Oct 50 calls, which are now 5.4 percent OTM and expire in 24 days, are the most actives. 1,400 traded. October 70 and Weekly 50 calls are seeing high volume as well. Bearish Flow Unusual action surfaced in Star Scientific (CIGX) today. Shares are relatively weak and trading down 7 cents to $2.62. Meanwhile, some players are focused on CIGX puts. There is no bid on the contract, as it is 24 percent out-of-the-money and expires in 24 days. Still, some investors appear to be paying a nickel per contract to open new positions. 7,800 traded against 1,250 in open interest. CIGX tumbled to $1.5 per share in late-August on news of a negative court ruling. Today's put buyers might be taking positions on concerns about additional volatility in the stock in the weeks ahead. Popular (BPOP), a Puerto Rican bank, added 18 cents to $1.65 and one player sells 11,300 January 2 puts on the stock at 14 cents per contract. Since open interest is 2,265, the call write appears to be a new position. It's not necessarily a bearish play, but seems to reflect expectations that shares will hold below $2 through the Jan expiration, which represents a 21.2 percent rally over the next 115 days. The stock is up today, but has not performed well in recent months and is down 47.1 percent year-to-date. A shareholder might have initiated the call write against stock as part of a covered call strategy. Unusual Volume Ivanhoe Mines (IVN) options volume is running 17X the (22-day) average, with 71,000 contracts traded and call activity accounting for 84 percent of the volume. SPDR Basic Materials ETF (XLB) options volume is 2.5X the average daily, with 70,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 65 percent of the activity. Walgreens (WAG) options volume is running 4X the average daily, with 46,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 55 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in Range Resources (RRC), SAP, and Popular (BPOP). Implied Volatility Mover Starbucks (SBUX) implied volatility is easing amid put selling today. Shares gained $1 to $40.49 and the biggest trade in the coffee chain is a 3,500 block of October 40 puts at $1.59 on the International Securities Exchange.

2011-10-03,Market Has Broken Two Critical Levels  10-03-2011,"Cusick's Corner The market into the Midday has broken two critical levels, 1120 and 1102 on the S&Ps, which has the bears in complete control and new lows are potentially in sight. Now if we do get a bounce, let's say to 1150 on the S&Ps, the shorts could come under squeeze pressure, but I have seen enough action to say that the downside and the EU headlines that continue to come out have been worse than the stories out of a bad Greek wedding. Be careful playing the short side, there is too much cash on the sidelines, so watch this pullback and when or if we get to new lows, i.e. 1050 on the S&Ps, there could be some great bargains. This is how I am looking at this market. See you After Hours. Stock market averages are under water despite better-than-expected economic data. A report released in morning trading Monday showed the ISM Index of manufacturing activity up to 51.6 in September, from 50.6 the month before and better than the 50.5 that was expected. Meanwhile, Construction Spending rose 1.4 percent in August. Economists were looking for a decline of -.5 percent. Yet, although stock market averages ticked higher on the data, domestic news continues to take a backseat to events in Europe. The euro fell to 8 month lows against the buck and to decade lows on the yen amid ongoing concerns about the European Debt Crisis. European stock market averages also finished with losses. Volatility on the other side of the Atlantic has once again spilled over onto US shores. Through midday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 130 points and the tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 43. CBOE Volatility Index (.VIX) added another 1 point to 43.96. Overall options volume is active, with 4.5 million calls and 5.2 million puts traded across the exchanges through 12:45pm ET. Bullish Flow Yahoo (YHOO) sees relative strength and options on the Internet company are actively traded after Bloomberg reported that Alibaba's Chairman Jack Ma said he is very interested in buying the company. Yahoo is up 37 cents to $13.54. Options volume on the stock through midday includes 61,000 calls and 16,000 puts. October 15 calls, which are now 10.8 percent out-of-the-money and expiring in 18 days, are the most actives. 8,680 traded. Weekly (10/7), November and January $15 calls are actively traded as well. Some players are likely buying upside calls on hopes that some sort of official takeover announcement will lift shares beyond $15 in the months ahead. No actual announcement has been made, however. Sangamo Biosciences (SGMO) is trading down $1.10 to $3.25 after the biotech announced that is has halted the study of a diabetic treatment after the drug failed to meet targets in a Phase 2 study. SGMO has tumbled 45.8 percent from $6 per share just two weeks ago (9/16). Options order flow on the stock is interesting, as 4,310 calls and 800 puts traded in the name. Typical volume through midday is less than 800 contracts. November 3 calls are the most actives. 1,110 traded. November 6 and January 9 calls are seeing interest as well. Moreover, with about 70 percent of the overall call volume trading at the ask, it appears that some call buyers view the weakness in SGMO as an opportunity for bullish options trades on the stock. Bearish Flow General Electric (GE) is down 37 cents to $14.85 and one of twenty-nine Dow stocks losing ground today. Only Walmart shares are moving higher in the Dow. GE shares are now making a run back towards a 52-week low of $14.72 set on 9/12. Meanwhile, options volume in GE includes 159,000 puts and 67,000 calls. Typical volume through midday is about 83,000, according to Trade Alert data. The action includes a buyer of 34,000 October 12 puts at an average of about 15 cents per contract. The position looks opening and a bearish short-term play on GE. Oct 12 puts on the stock are 18.5 percent out-of-the-money and expire in 18 days. SPDR Basic Materials Fund (XLB) is trading down 38 cents to $28.98 and options volume on the ETF through midday includes 24,000 puts and 3,720 calls. One strategist sold 7,000 October 32 puts on the fund and bought 15,000 December 27 puts at $1.74. It looks like a roll down five strikes and out two months. After a 28-percent slide in shares since July 21, the strategist is probably selling a position in Oct 32 puts, which are $3 in-the-money, to open a new position in the Dec 27s, which are $2 out-of-the-money. Unusual Volume SPDR Oil and Exploration ETF (XOP) options volume is running 6X the (22-day) average, with 102,000 contracts traded and put activity accounting for 76 percent of the volume. Eastman Kodak (EK) options volume is 3X the average daily, with 98,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 54 percent of the activity. CREE options volume is running 3X the average daily, with 66,000 contracts traded and call volume representing 95 percent of the total volume. Increasing options activity is also being seen in AMR, Focus Media (FMCN), and Western Digital (WDC). Implied Volatility Mover iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-term Futures (VXX) is up $1.82 to $55.19 on a volatile start to the month of October. Shares, which track short-term market volatility through futures contracts, have now rallied 136 percent since July. Options volume on the VXX through midday includes 27,000 calls and 31,000 puts. The top trade is a 6,250 contract block of January 2013 $15 puts on the fund, which was bought at $1.10 per contract. The strategist is possibly taking a position on the view that extreme levels of market volatility will ease through 2012 and into 2013. VXX recorded a 52-week low of $19.88 on July 7. Therefore, a move to $15, or 72.8 percent below current levels, might not be entirely out of the realm of reality."

2011-10-25,Mike Khouw's Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) Trade,"On CNBC's Fast Money, Mike Khouw suggested an options strategy in Materials Select Sector SPDR (AMEX: XLB). He explained that the companies that make the XLB had a strong bounce of the bottoms, and it would be wise to hedge the gains if you want to keep your long positions. Mike Khouw wants to put on a put spread risk reversal in Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB). Specifically, he wants to buy the January 33 put for $2, and sell the January 30 put for $1.10. Additionally, he wants to sell the January 37 call for $0.85. This trade would cost him five cents, and it gives him a 10% protection in the material sector. Materials Select Sector SPDR (AMEX: XLB) fell 2.55% today, and it closed at $33.30."
2011-11-18,4 ETFs As Replacements For Beaten Down Materials Names,"It's as true as the day is long: The risk on trade gets turned off and materials stock suffer. However, high-beta materials names hold plenty of allure for investors that like risk, those that are willing to bet on a global economic recovery or both. The good news is there are a lot of upper crust materials stocks that have suffered their share of beatings this year and are now on sale. Maybe even better news for the more conservative investor is that there are plenty of ETFs out there that can be used as replacements for owning these stocks directly. So if you're yearning for materials exposure without making an all-in bet on just one or two specific stocks, consider the following ETFs. iShares MSCI Australia Index Fund (NYSE: EWA): In a strong bull market, owning some BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) is a wise idea. It's the world's largest mining company and is flush with cash with which to make acquisitions and reward shareholders. Still, this is one high-beta name that some investors may not want to own outright. The iShares MSCI Australia Index Fund offers enough BHP exposure at 14% to have you watching BHP, but not losing sleep over it. iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ): We'll be honest and say that we have not been fans of ETFs that are heavy on Brazilian oil giant Petrobras (NYSE: PBR) this year. With good reason because Petrobras has been the worst-performing global integrated oil stock for well over a year now. That said, an argument can be made Petrobras is cheap and long-term investors will be rewarded. If you don't want to bet the farm on Petrobras, try EWZ, which allocates more than 17% of its weight to Petrobras securities. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB): The Materials Select Sector SPDR is more conservative than EWZ for sure and it looks like a good replacement for two stocks: Dow component DuPont (NYSE: DD) and Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX). Those names combine for 20% of XLB's weight. Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL): Investors probably don't need to own Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) and Consol Energy (NYSE: CNX) outright at the same time. Adding in Joy Global (Nasdaq: JOYG), it would be risky to own this trio as individual stocks simultaneously. Stop with the coal stock-picking and just buy KOL, which could have a upside of 30% or more from current levels. Bull case: It's painfully obvious. Investors need to embrace risk in a big way and emerging markets will need to be back in style. Bear case: Europe continues to way heavy. Inflation remains a concern in Brazil and China and the U.S. economy falters."
2011-12-27,Checking In: Another Under The Radar Resources ETF,"In what will go down as a tough year for the high beta trade, 2011 has been tough on scores of energy and materials ETFs regardless of how old or new those funds are. Europe's sovereign debt woes, slowing emerging markets growth and plenty of issues within the U.S. economy have chased investors out of volatile energy and materials ETFs into the waiting arms of staples and utilities ETFs. Said differently, there have been betters to introduce materials ETFs, but give the FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index ETF (NYSE: GUNR) for defying the odds. The 134-stock ETF has raked in almost $151 million in assets under management since its mid-September debut. Hey, that's better than some materials ETFs that have been on the market several years. GUNR has an expense ratio of 0.48%, which puts its well above the dominant SPDR and Vanguard materials ETFs, but the new ETF does have a story to tell. Tracking the Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index, GUNR has gained over 6.2% in the past three months, GUNR spreads out its allocations well as no stock gets a weight of more than 5.34%. Honors for the ETF's largest holding go to Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and other top-10 holdings read like a who's who of the energy and mining sectors. BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP), Potash (NYSE: POT), Monasnto (NYSE: MON), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), BP (NYSE: BP) and Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: GUNR) are also among the names in GUNR's top-10 fray. Something else to consider is GUNR's sector breakdown: 57% materials, 30% energy and, we kid you not, 7% to consumer staples and 4% to utilities. Go figure, but maybe that 11% makes GUNR a little more palatable for risk-averse investors. Ten countries get allocations worth mentioning in GUNR, but three – the U.S., Canada and the U.K. – account for about 70% of the ETF's weight. So overall, the FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources ETF is off to a stellar start, especially when considering the environment, and that AUM total is impressive under any circumstances. And if 2012 delivers the rebirth of the risk on trade, then GUNR will be an excellent performer. That much is clear. However, we leave with a truth that must be acknowledged: In the past three months, GUNR has been sharply outperformed by the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW). As in XLB and VAW have doubled in GUNR's returns in the past 90 days and they've done that with expense ratios of 0.2% and soon to be 0.19% in the case of VAW, respectively."
2012-01-10,Five Key ETFs For Q4 Earnings Reports,"We're back to it. Dow component Alcoa (NYSE: AA) got the ball rolling on another earnings season yesterday after the close and the response has been decent, but the really important earnings updates don't start rolling until Friday when J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) reports before the bell. Even with next week being a holiday-shortened week, there is still an avalanche of earnings reports, particularly from the financial services sector. And arguably that sector belongs on our list of ETF earnings plays. Then again, it might be too early to be dipping out toes into the murky waters of bank stocks. For now, we'll let the bank dogs lies and focus on other sector funds that should be on every trader's radar this earnings season. In no particular order... Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) With earnings reports from Alcoa and Monsanto (NYSE: MON) out of the way (that's over 12% of this ETF's weight), the Materials Select Sector SPDR has already been an earnings play. In fact, the ETF has just been a solid play in 2012, gaining 4% in the early stages of the year. XLB makes the list not because profit updates from its constituents are important (yes, they are), but more because continued bullishness in this fund and continued weakness in utilities or staples ETFs might just validate the return of the risk on trade. Keep an eye on XLB above $36. Global X NASDAQ 500 ETF (Nasdaq: QQQV) This will be the first reporting season for the newly minted Global X NASDAQ 500 ETF and it makes our list because the looming earnings updates by and any potential guidance from tech juggernauts Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) will play a heavy role in legitimizing any early-year rally in stocks. Apple and Amazon combine for over 14% of the Global X NASDAQ 500 ETF's weights. Bulls are hoping those two combined for a banner holiday shopping season. iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average (NYSE: IYT) OK, it's reasonable to expect the five commercial airlines that call the iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average won't set the world on fire with their profit reports and we say that because oil prices are high. However, railroad stocks represent almost a third of IYT's weight. That group is also one of the best temperature checks on the economy at large. Good reports and guidance from Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) and friends will keep IYT chugging along, putting a smile on the faces of Dow theorists everywhere. ALPS Alerian MLP ETF (NYSE: AMLP) Alright, the ALPS Alerian MLP ETF might be a stretch on this list, but as we have noted the importance of MLPs cannot be diminished in this low yield environment. The thing to watch for with AMLP constituents isn't earnings as much as it distributable cash flow guidance and/or news on payout increase. iShares S&P Global Energy ETF (NYSE: IXC) Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) account for over 23% of this ETF's weight, but we're far more interested in what BP (NYSE: BP), has to say about its dividend and asset sales. Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS-A) is another dividend play in IXC to watch. Schlumberger's (NYSE: SLB) is always worth listening to."
2012-01-12,AdvisorShares to Introduce Fund of Funds ETF Today,"AdvisorShares, the ETF issuer known primarily for its actively managed offerings, will introduce the AdvisorShares ROCKLEDGE SectorSAM ETF (NYSE: SSAM) ETF today. The ETF will be buying (being long) the sector ETFs that Rockledge forecasts to outperform the S&P 500 Index while also selling (being short) an equal dollar amount of sector ETFs that they forecast to underperform the S&P 500, based on a proprietary quantitative analysis known as the “Sector Scoring and Allocation Methodology” (SectorSAM), according to the AdvisorShares Web site. SSAM is expected to hold equal amounts long and short positions so it will be dollar neutral. The new ETF has an expense ratio of 1.5%. The ETF's current long positions consists of the Materials Selector Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE). The fund is short the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF), Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE), Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV), Consumer Discretionary Selec Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY) and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI). Maryland-based AdvisorShares lists 13 ETFs on its Web site. The firm had $370 million in assets under management as of mid-September 2011."

2012-01-31,"China's Materials Gambit Exposed, Play These ETFs","The World Trade Organization says China isn't playing nice or fair with its raw materials exports. As if that's stunning news, but on Monday the WTO did uphold an earlier ruling that said China has violated violated international trade rules for restricting exports on nine raw materials. Of course, anyone that follows the rare earths sector knows something about China not being too liberal with its exports. Apparently, that stance extends to more than just rare earths. Monday's ruling affects China's exports of certain forms of bauxite, coke, fluorspar, magnesium, manganese, silicon carbide, silicon metal, yellow phosphorous and zinc, the Associated Press reported. Whether or not the WTO ruling gets China in a sharing mood remains to be seen, but in the meantime, consider the following ETFs on the assumption China will be forced to play a more honest materials exporting game. Market Vectors Rare Earth/Strategic Metals ETF (NYSE: REMX) One place where China clearly doesn't place with its exports is the rare earths space, but that didn't translate to a good performance for REMX last year. In fact, REMX was an utter disappointment last year. On the bright side, REMX is up about 18% year-to-date and an improving global economy could buoy the rare earths demand story. Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) Let's be honest: U.S. steel companies are no fans of China flooding the market with cheap exports. Manganese is a key ingredient in the production of steel and maybe China's willingness to withhold exports of that material means the country wants to keep more of its steel at home for domestic stimulation through infrastructure projects. That's a big maybe, but more competitive steel pricing is good news for SLX. Up 16% year-to-date, the ETF is another 2011 stinker turned early 2012 winner. Global X Aluminum ETF (NYSE: ALUM) Ingredients in the aluminum production process were among those mentioned in the WTO's chastising of China. The theory and the stretch here is similar to what we just discussed with SLX: If China wants to keep aluminum off the global market, prices could easily rise, benefiting ALUM in the process. Then again, the ETF may not need much help. It's up 17% to start the new year. At the very least if the WTO ruling can create a more level playing field, ALUM and SLX could be winners under that scenario. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) A fine ETF for either confirming or disavowing the risk on trade, the Materials Select Sector SPDR devotes over 16% of its weight to Dow component DuPont (NYSE: DD) and rival Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW). We bring that up because Chinese chemicals exports were also mentioned by the WTO. Overall, XLB is littered with U.S. companies that do battle with Chinese exports. WisdomTree India Earnings ETF (NYSE: EPI) Don't forget that India was part of the WTO complaint against China and don't forget that EPI devotes over 12% of its weight to the materials sector. Many Indian materials firms are exporters of Chinese raw materials and with Chinese materials makers previously inflating prices for export while keeping prices low for domestic consumption, Indian firms were arguably hurt by that equation. Other potential emerging markets ETFs that could benefit from the WTO ruling include the following: iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ), iShares MSCI Chile Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: ECH), iShares MSCI Mexico Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: EWW) and the Global X FTSE Argentina 20 ETF (NYSE: ARGT)."
2012-02-08,ETFs For QE3: More Than Just GLD,"Comments by San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams today serve as a reminder that another round of quantitative easing remains at the Fed's disposal should the U.S. economy start to falter. Williams appears to be a fan of buying mortgage-backed securities, but how many fans will QE3 have? Arguably, QE3 is about as good of an idea as Godfather III, maybe worse. Fixed income experts have argued more asset purchases by the Fed could spell the end of the bull market for bonds. In 2010, Pimco's Bill Gross said Check writing [QE2] in the trillions is not a bondholder's friend; it is in fact inflationary, and, if truth be told, somewhat of a Ponzi scheme. Simply put, another round of QE is likely to be viewed as controversial and that's probably putting things mildly. Of course, another QE package will be good news for select ETFs and that means more than just gold funds such as the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) and the iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU). If QE3 does arrive, the following ETFs could very well thrive. Market Vectors Mortgage REIT Income ETF (NYSE: MORT) In theory, the Market Vector Mortgage REIT Income ETF should at least have potential assuming the Fed ups its purchases of mortgage-backed securities. However, a very real problem for MORT exists in the form of some of its constituents' dividends being viewed as vulnerable. American Capital (Nasdaq: AGNC) announced a divided cut earlier this week, but some analysts have defended the stock. That stock represents almost 14.6% of MORT's weight and Annaly Capital (NYSE: NLY) accounts for another 20%. If Fed action helps stocks like Annaly and American Capital, then MORT benefits. It's that simple. ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) As we noted earlier, there are more winners under a QE3 scenario than just gold and some can be find with gold's cheaper but still precious alternatives. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns, but QE2 was announced in late August 2010. Around that time PALL was in the $52-$53 range. The ETF finished 2010 flirting with $75 and much of that gain can be attributed to QE2. FactorShares 2X: S&P500 Bull/USD Bear (NYSE: FSU) Just a couple weeks shy of its first birthday, the FactorShares 2X: S&P500 Bull/USD Bear is one of the most unique leveraged ETFs out there. It's best to let the issuer tell you what the fund does. FSU seeks to track approximately +200% of the daily return of the S&P 500 Non-U.S. Dollar Index (before fees and expenses) by primarily establishing a leveraged long position in the E-mini S&P 500 Stock Price Index Futures and a leveraged short position in the U.S. Dollar Index Futures, according to the FactorShares Web site. Translation: FSU offers a straight forward approach to more QE: Long stocks, short the greenback. Just don't make a habit of this leveraged fund as it has an expense ratio of 0.75%. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) Since QE has a way of stoking risk appetite, an equities-based materials play makes sense as an addition to this list. With XLB, we're applying the same logic as we did with PALL. In August 2010, XLB was trading in the $32-$33 area. By the end of the year, the ETF was over $38. Even with no QE3, XLB might be worth a look here. The ETF is up over 12% year-to-date and recently cleared some stiff resistance. The ETF could have upside to the $40-$42 area."
2012-02-10,"Danger, Danger: Prep For A Sell-Off With These Inverse ETFs","The reasons are plentiful regarding why investors and even active traders should tread carefully with leveraged and inverse ETFs but if today's market pullback sticks around for a while, the utility of these ETFs (when properly used) has the potential to shine. Inverse ETFs are probably the best bet of the three primary ways most folks establish bearish stances. Shorting individual stocks can be costly due to the margin requirements. Buying put options is fine, but if a stock or index doesn't fall as much as you need it to before expiry, then the puts are worthless. In other words, inverse and leveraged ETFs aren't the devil of the financial world, as long as they are used as short-term trading instruments, not long-term investments. Consider the following inverse ETFs if today's glum market action is a sign of things to come. Direxion Daily Latin America Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: LHB) Latin American stocks and ETFs have been impressive to start the year. Brazil, Chile Mexico and others have wiped 2011 from investors' memories. The good start to 2012 could make LatAm ETFs vulnerable to some near-term profit-taking. The Direxion Daily Latin America Bear 3X Shares is not for the faint of heart. No triple-leveraged ETF is, but with LHB trading for less than $12, it could prove to be a profitable hedge for a couple of days on existing positions in ETFs such as the iShares MSCI Brazil Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ) or the iShares MSCI Mexico Investable Market Index Fund (NYSE: EWW). FactorShares 2X: Gold Bull/S&P500 Bear (NYSE: FSG) FSG tracks the S&P Gold - Equity Spread Total Return Index and generates returns by establishing a leveraged long position in Gold Futures and a leveraged short position in the E-mini S&P 500 Stock Price Index, according to the FactorShares Web site. Translation: If stocks pullback and gold regains its safe-haven status, FSG becomes appealing. ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN) At the start of trading today, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) was one of the best performers among the select sector SPDRs on a year-to-date basis and with a solid January run in the books, more gains could be on the way for XLB later this year. The big but is when the riskier assets retreat, materials stocks are almost always part of that equation. SMN is great short-term hedge on positions in ETFs such as XLB or the Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL) or stocks such as Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX). Direxion Daily Small Cap Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: TZA) There was evidence of a January Effect, or small-cap leadership, and that encouraged an increase in risk appetite. That scenario may also make small-caps vulnerable on the downside and that validates TZA as an ETF worth TRADING. This is one of those ETFs that can have you thinking you've mastered the market one day and pulling your hair out the next day. In the span of about five weeks from September-October 2011, TZA went from $40 to over $60 and back down to $40 again. That's a warning label. ProShares Short QQQ (NYSE: PSQ) With the Nasdaq flirting with levels not seen in over a decade that means the tech-heavy index could easily be fertile ground for some downside savagery. PSQ is not a leveraged fund, so if the PowerShares QQQ (Nasdaq: QQQ) loses 1% on a given day, PSQ will be higher by roughly the same amount. This one is useful for those looking to get their feet wet with inverse ETFs because it's fairly calm compared to the other members of this list."

2012-02-22,"ETF Haters Keep On Hatin (XLB, XLE, IEZ)","The boo-birds, naysayers and haters just keep on bashing exchange-traded products. It's almost becoming a national past time on par with baseball, the Super Bowl and Fourth of July barbecues. Latest up on the ETF hit parade is the notion that if an investor is somehow fortunate enough to choose the best-performing stock in a given ETF, that stock will outperform the fund. It stands to reason and if it's true, it's probably fair to say best single stocks trumping funds can be applied to mutual funds, too. After all, by some estimates, 70% or more of mutual fund managers cannot outperform the S&P 500. Right? So let's see if owning an ETF's best-performing stock really does beat the fund. First, the argument needs to consider how much legwork one should be expected to perform. Even if we strip out all inverse and leveraged ETFs, bond funds and the ETFs and ETNs based on physical commodities we're still left with hundreds of plain vanilla long equities-based ETFs, some of which track indexes of 300, 400, 500 stocks or more. Obviously, that would be a time-consuming tax. Maybe the question is best answered by looking at an ETF's top components. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) offers some insight regarding the stocks vs. ETF debate. Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX), the two largest U.S. oil companies, account for almost a third of XLE's weight. Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) are the ETF's third- and fourth-largest holdings and ConocoPhillips is number five. At the start of trading today on a year-to-date basis, XLE was a better bet than Exxon, Chevron and Conoco, but lagged Occidental and Schlumberger. Change your time horizons to the past year, two years and five years and it's worth noting XLE is never the top performer. It's also never the worst. This is almost certainly the case with any number of sector funds and we conducted a similar evaluation of several other SPDRs funds, including the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) with similar results. Over various time frames, the ETFs beat a lot of their components, get beat by a few and rarely, if ever are the worst laggards. Of course the argument that buying an ETF's best individual stock is a winning strategy is dependent on several flawed arguments. First and perhaps most important, looking at an ETF's top performing stock is obviously dependent on current or past data. No one has a crystal ball. XLE's best performer today or last month may be its worst laggard next week or next year. Second, the reality is most investors, professionals included, probably won't pick the stock that winds up to be an ETF's top performer. And if someone does pick an ETF's star stock, there's no guarantee the investor holds it for the entire move. Take the example of National Oilwell Varco (NYSE: NOV) and the iShares Dow Jones US Oil Equipment Index Fund (NYSE: IEZ). It's pretty safe to say NOV has been one of the best large-cap oil services stocks in recent years. NOV has hammered IEZ over the past five years. The stock is up almost 150% over that time, but who held it from $88 to $23 in 2008 and rode it all the way back to where it is today? Answer: Only those with crystal balls, the best dumb luck known to man, a death wish or the dollar-cost averaging folks that were just convinced NOV was going to come back. It's probably fair to see all four groups were lightly populated. It's fine and dandy to say single stocks beat ETFs (and mutual funds), but the premise of ETFs has never been nor will it ever be to replace single stocks in portfolios. ETFs are sector/country/thematic instruments that are arguably less risky than single-stocks. Remember, an obvious advantage of ETF is they mitigate stock-specific risk. Said differently, it would be nice to own DuPont (NYSE: DD) if it was always the best stock in XLB, but where would one rather be if DuPont went bankrupt tomorrow (we're NOT saying that will happen). Holding DuPont shares or XLB? Bottom line is the single-stock-beats-ETF theory works until it doesn't and only when one is fortunate enough to pick what turns out to be the gold-star component of a given ETF."
2012-02-28,Durable Goods Orders Signal a Struggling Industrial Sector,"Durable Goods Orders are compiled from results of the U.S. Census Bureau's Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders survey. This survey provides data on manufacturers' value of shipments, new orders, end-of-month unfilled orders, end-of-month total inventory and inventories by stage of fabrication. According to the US Census Bureau, Durable Goods Orders in January decreased 4.0 percent, which was lower than the -1.0 percent estimate. Core Durable Goods Orders (ex-transportation) also decreased more than expected, reading -3.2 percent versus a 0.0 percent estimate. This is essentially bearish for the manufacturing sector and negative for general economic growth in the United States. US equity futures spiked lower on above average pre-market trading volume after this poor reading in the manufacturing sector. According to the report, new orders for manufactured durable goods in January decreased $8.6 billion or 4.0 percent to $206.1 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau announced today. This decrease, down following three consecutive monthly increases, followed a 3.2 percent December increase. Excluding transportation, new orders decreased 3.2 percent. Excluding defense, new orders decreased 4.5 percent. Transportation equipment, down following two consecutive monthly increases, had the largest decrease, $3.6 billion or 6.1 percent to $55.2 billion. This was due to nondefense aircraft and parts, which decreased $3.8 billion. ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that Durable Goods Orders is a leading indicator for the US economy, you might want to consider the following trades: Long general industrial (NYSE: XLI) companies like Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW) or Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) as these companies will benefit for increasing industrial production. Also, long material (NYSE: XLB) companies like Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) or Alcoa (NYSE: AA) Bearish:Traders who do not believe that the manufacturing survey is a leading indicator for the general US economy, you may consider alternative positions: Long Consumer Staple companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Colgate (NYSE: CL) because even if the economy is struggling, people still need to buy staple products like shampoo and toothpaste. Also, short big-ticket appliance makers like Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR) if the manufacturing trend is worse-than-expected.

2012-03-07,"Could The Jobs Report Make or Break These ETFs? (XLB, EWC, SLX)","Following Wednesday's ADP private sector jobs report that showed non-government U.S. employers added 216,000 jobs in February, which topped an estimate of 208,000, a lot of folks are expecting big things on Friday morning when the Labor Department delivers non-farm payroll data for February. The current Wall Street consensus hovers around 250,000, but there's a case to be made that the number could be higher. Even if the February jobs report shows the addition of 250,000, that could be enough to send the bears packing for a couple of days at least and support more gains for high beta fare. After waning in recent days, several ETFs could really use a pick me up in the form of a positive NFP number on Friday. Here are a few to keep an eye on. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) The Materials Select Sector SPDR has been a decent performer this year, but what was once a double-digit year-to-date gain has wilted as the ETF has dropped over 4% in the past month. Wednesday's modest gain barely made a dent in XLB's Tuesday tumble and the ETF is still languishing below its 50-day moving average. XLB's constituency is loaded with economically sensitive companies and none of them would pass up a good jobs report. Some of them, we're looking at you Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX), desperately need it for a near-term boost. Bottom line: Short or stay away from XLB if the market doesn't like the February jobs number. First Trust ISE-Revere Natural Gas Index Fund (NYSE: FCG) Recently battered by the seemingly never-ending decline in natural gas futures, FCG could get a boost from bullish payroll data because that data may support the notion that utilities are using more natural gas as the economy improves. Then again, FCG's story is misunderstood because of its name. Almost all of FCG's constituents are looking to boost their oil production. iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average (NYSE: IYT) One look at its chart shows the iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average is laboring below its 20- and 50-day moving averages and that this fund has gotten gradually weaker over the past two weeks. A lot of IYT's woes rest with high oil prices, but when an ETF's roster includes the likes of FedEx (NYSE: FDX), Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) and some airlines, strong payroll data never hurts. In fact, IYT needs the February number to be strong or the ETF could easily turn negative on a year-to-date basis. iShares MSCI Canada Index Fund (NYSE: EWC) Arguably, no country takes its economic cues from the U.S. the way Canada does and there is some virtue to investing north of the border. That said, EWC has plunged 4% in the past week. Due to the fact that Canada is the largest importer of oil to the U.S., if any group of non-U.S. country ETFs need a good jobs report on Friday, it's EWC and its brethren. Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) The technicals on this high beta ETF have deteriorated rapidly in the past month and the price action is nothing to crow about either as SLX has plunged almost 11%. SLX's U.S.-based components are extremely sensitive to U.S. economic data. That's concerning because the data has been pretty good in the past month and SLX has been dreadful.

2012-03-14,"Finally A Chemicals ETF? (DD, XLB, MXI)","With the rapid expansion of the exchange-traded products universe, finding sectors or sub-sectors not represented among ETFs and ETNs is a hard thing to do these days, but if one is to separate chemicals makers from the materials group, then there is no ETF devoted exclusively to companies such as Dow component DuPont (NYSE: DD). Van Eck, parent company of Market Vectors, is looking to change and has filed plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission to possibly introduce the Market Vectors Global Chemicals ETF, which would track U.S.-based and international companies that depend on chemicals sales and production for at least half of their revenue. The ETF would track the Market Vectors Global Chemical Index, a rules-based index that rebalances twice a year. As of February, the index comprised 158 securities with an average market capitalization of $7.8 billion, according to Index Universe. Companies must have a market cap of at least $150 million and a three-month average daily trading volume of at least $1 million to be included in the index. While there is currently no chemicals-specific ETF on the market, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) features DuPont, Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) and Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE: APD) among its top-10 holdings. Those stocks combine for about 20% of XLB's weight. The iShares S&P Global Materials Index Fund (NYSE: MXI) also offers exposure to chemical producers such as Dow, DuPont, Air Products and others."
2012-03-19,"The Don Draper ETF Portfolio (XLB, PBS, XLP)","March is turning out to be quite a month. First, the NCAA Tournament has provided a fair amount of upsets, per usual. Then investors were treated to some more good news today courtesy of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL). Well, don't let it be lost in the shuffle that the new season of Mad Men starts on Sunday March 25. The Emmy award winning show is back for its fifth season and if other shows are deemed worthy then Mad Men certainly deserves a crack at its own ETF portfolio. In this case, we'll name it in honor of the sometimes offensive, not always sober, but always stylish Don Draper. Instead of wondering what would Draper do, think about how Draper would invest. iShares S&P Global Consumer Staples Index Fund (NYSE: KXI) Smoking isn't quite the sexy social habit it used to be, but to accurately depict the time period in which Mad Men is set, the show's characters light up. A lot. In fact, Lucky Strike has been one of the fictitious advertising agency's clients in previous seasons. While there is no ETF devoted specifically to sin stocks, the iShares S&P Global Consumer Staples Index Fund is a great way to get involved with high-yielding tobacco stocks as Philip Morris (NYSE: PM), British American (NYSE: BTI) and Altria (NYSE: MO) are all found among the ETF's top-10 holdings. Don Draper would probably like the fact that KXI is up over 18% in the past year. PowerShares Dynamic Media Portfolio (NYSE: PBS) The closest thing one get to actually owning Don Draper through an investable security is with shares of AMC Networks (Nasdaq: AMCX), the company that broadcasts Mad Men. There must be something Wall Street likes about AMC shows because the stock is up almost 17% year-to-date and the PowerShares Dynamic Media Portfolio is one of the few ETFs that offers any decent allocation to the stock. The PowerShares Dynamic Leisure & Entertainment Portfolio (NYSE: PEJ) is another to consider. Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF (NYSE: VGK) Viewers are led to believe a few of the characters on Mad Men are World War II veterans, so they may not be the biggest fans of an ETF that features allocations to German and Italian companies. They may not to be fussed on the fact that French companies figure prominently in the Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF, either. On the other hand, VGK's top 100 holdings feature two tobacco companies and six alcohol or beer makers. As Roger Sterling once said: We drink because it's what men do. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) Investors do not need to own the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR and the iShares S&P Global Consumer Staples Index Fund at the same time, but a quick look at the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce client list shows XLP is definitely an ETF the Mad Men crew could warm up to. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) Count a couple of chemicals companies among the SCDP client roster and XLB makes the list as a result. Until that new chemicals ETF comes to market, XLB is really the only game in town when it comes to getting decent exposure to the likes of Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) and DuPont (NYSE: DD) in one ETF."
2012-03-22,"Avoid These ETFs For Now (FXI, TVIX, GDXJ)","The reality is we live in an instant gratification world and the financial markets are no exception. If anything, the markets are perpetrators of the please me now outlook so many of us have. No big deal because there is clearly something to be said in favor of short-term trading. On the other hand, trading for the sake of trading is not a sound risk management philosophy and sometimes it pays to know what to avoid as it is knowing what to embrace. That's what we're looking at here: A few ETFs that have particularly bleak prospects over the next several weeks that have the near-term avoid label. VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short-Term ETN (NYSE: TVIX) The level of controversy surrounding volatility ETNs is just too much to make them worth embracing. Like leveraged ETFs such as the Direxion Daily Financial Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: FAS), volatility ETNs like TVIX are best left to the pros. When an ETN drops more than 12% in a single day in part because its net asset value got a little rich, it's probably best to leave this thing alone. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) This is one a lot of traders clearly have on their personal avoid/sell short lists and that much is highlighted by what has become a grizzly performance over the past month. The knock on ETFs such as the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF and its large-cap cousin, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) has been that they don't do a good job of tracking gold prices on the upside. In twist of the dagger, these ETFs do respond to gold futures selling off. Let's say this: GDXJ was near $29 when Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke quashed hopes for QE3 in February. The ETF is at $24 today and looks poised to test its 52-week low. Don't be fooled by what looks like an inviting yield. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) The problem with the Materials Select Sector SPDR at the moment is two-fold. First, the ETF's chart shows technical vulnerability. Second, this an ETF that should be responding to positive U.S. economic data more than it is. XLB is being hamstrung by weakness in Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM), two of its top-10 holdings. Until those two names, Freeport in particular, get their acts together, XLB is in for near-term weakness. iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) There are plenty of reasons to be avoiding the China pain train right now and plenty of ETFs where a short or sidelines approach is warranted. Actually, there are nearly 230 ETFs offering China exposure, but FXI, the largest China fund makes the list today. Yes, Chinese equities have cheaper valuations right now than broader emerging markets universe. The broader Chinese market is also down over the past year and the macro environment is not supportive of more upside in the here and now. We're not forecasting a new bear market for Chinese stocks, but we will say better prices will be available for FXI in the coming weeks."

This survey provides data on manufacturers' value of shipments, new orders, end-of-month unfilled orders, end-of-month total inventory and inventories by stage of fabrication. According to the US Census Bureau, Durable Goods Orders in February increased 2.2 percent, which was lower than the 3.0 percent estimate. Core Durable Goods Orders (ex-transportation) also increased less than expected, reading 1.6 percent versus a 1.7 percent estimate. This is essentially bearish for the manufacturing sector and negative for general economic growth in the United States. US equity futures spiked lower in pre-market trading after the worse than expected reading. According to the report, New orders for manufactured durable goods in February increased $4.5 billion or 2.2 percent to $211.8 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau announced today. This increase, up four of the last five months, followed a 3.6 percent January decrease. Excluding transportation, new orders increased 1.6 percent. Excluding defense, new orders increased 1.7 percent. Inventories of manufactured durable goods in February, up twenty-six consecutive months, increased $1.6 billion or 0.4 percent to $373.7 billion. This was at the highest level since the series was first published on a NAICS basis in 1992 and followed a 0.6 percent January increase. Revised seasonally adjusted January figures for all manufacturing industries were: new orders, $462.9 billion (revised from $462.6 billion); shipments, $463.1 billion (revised from $463.6 billion); unfilled orders, $918.8 billion (revised from $917.9 billion); and total inventories, $614.3 billion (revised from $614.7 billion).

2012-04-02,"Loving Low-Beta ETFs (XLP, XLV, VTV)","Boring is beautiful is one of the investing adages that has a tendency to be overused, but it might be an appropriate maxim for the current market environment. Indeed, it was high-beta, riskier fare that drove equities higher through the first seven weeks of the 2012. Emerging markets, energy and select materials ETFs all had their days and weeks in the sun. That trend reverse course in March when the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) gained just half a percent and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) slid 3.5%. Still, the year-to-date performance gap between risk on stocks and ETFs and their more boring counterparts might be enough to keep enticing investors to eschew the ETFs their grandparents would love. In other words, boring stocks may keep trailing their sexier rivals, but that's not necessarily an invitation to ignore slow movers, either. And with May, which could bring selling and going away, right around the corner, it pays to note that March's sector leaders, might retain those titles for a few more months. Take a look at the following. Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) Arguably the king of boring sector funds, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR is up by a not-so-boring 3% in the past month. Philip Morris (NYSE: PM), XLP's third-largest holding at over 11% of the fund's weight, is helping lead the charge with a 6.1% jump over that time. A 7.1% gain by Dow component Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), 12.2% of XLP's weight, is certainly helping as well. Investors desiring a little bit more risk with a staples ETF might want to look at the First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXG), though it should be noted FXG's yield and recent performance trail XLP. Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV) The Health Care Select Sector SPDR is up almost 4% in the past month and Dow component Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has been helping drive the ETF's bullish ways with a gain of over 5%. Further validation of the embrace pharma trade comes in the form of the fact that both XLV and the rival Market Vectors Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSE: PPH) touched new 52-week highs today. iShares Dow Jones US Healthcare Provider Index Fund (NYSE: IHF) IHF has a beta that barely exceeds that of the S&P 500, but that nominal difference has not stopped IHF from outpacing the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) by almost a full percentage point over the past month. The ETF has utility on multiple fronts beyond being a conservative way to outperform the broader market. First, IHF could be a potential should Obamacare be overturned. Second, health care providers have a strong second quarter track record. Up almost 5% in the past week, IHF has also touched a new 52-week high today. Vanguard Value ETF (NYSE: VTV) The Vanguard Value ETF, had over $5.6 billion in assets under management at the end of February, making it one of the largest large-cap focused ETFs in the U.S. VTV was recently assailed by one pundit that put VTV on a list of the 10 worst large-cap ETFs. Long story short, that pundit implies that VTV is home to some so-called dangerous stocks, AT&T (NYSE: T) being one of them. Well, VTV is home to 418 stocks and it's reasonable to expect that when an ETF tracks that many stocks, some are going to be turkeys. After all, there probably aren't 420 large-cap stocks worth owning at the moment. Indeed, AT&T has been a dud for a while now, but only accounts for 2.9% of VTV's weight. The fund is up more than 10% year-to-date and has an expense ratio of just 0.12%. Combine those factors with a conservative lineup and a beta barely above one and we've got an ETF that is ideal for a market environment that favors the boring over the bold."
2012-04-10,Alcoa Jumps After-Hours Post-Earnings Beat,"Dow component Alcoa (NYSE: AA), the largest U.S. aluminum producer, is surging almost 4% in the after-hours session after the company reported first-quarter EPS of 10 cents a share compared. Pennsylvania-based Alcoa posted income from continuing operations of $94 million, or $0.09 per share; excluding special items, income from continuing operations of $105 million, or $0.10 per share, according to a statement. Alcoa posted revenue of $6 billion. Analysts expected a loss of $0.04 on $5.77 billion in sales. The company finished the quarter with $1.7 billion in cash on hand and reaffirmed 2012 global aluminum demand growth of 7%. Alcoa raised its demand forecast from aerospace customers by 3%. Alcoa's report traditionally marks the start of a new earnings season and the company's results are widely followed because of the cyclical nature of the aluminum industry and the tells regarding the health of the broader economy Alcoa's guidance can provide. Still, Alcoa is the second-lowest priced Dow stock behind Bank of America (NYSE: BAC). The Dow is a price-weighted index meaning at less than $10, Alcoa is unlikely to set the Dow's course on any given day.

2012-04-11,The Sobering Effect of Canada's 'Normal' Interest Rates,"By Howard Simons, Minyanville Has the chaperone ever been the hero in popular culture? No, and if discussion of the relatively strong prospects by default for the US dollar could focus on the self-trashing by Japan and Switzerland and the foibles of the eurozone, Canada has to be excluded from consideration. The consequences for US investors in Canadian equities are negative as evidenced by the 4.3% return year-to-date for the iShares MSCI Canada Fund (EWC) as compared to a 12.1% gain for the Russell 3000 (IWV). Higher Interest Rates Matter Canada prides itself, rightfully, on dodging the brunt of the 2008-2009 financial crisis because it never went as overboard on a residential real estate bubble as did the US and others. As an aside, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke does not think the US residential real estate bubble was a consequence of a deliberate attempt by his predecessor to create a real estate bubble, and celebrates homeowners' “extraction” of equity from their houses. Any institution wishing to study the principle of infallibility should pay a visit to Constitution Avenue. Canadian short-term interest rates have been higher than their US counterparts since QE1, often stunningly so. There are many ways to illustrate this spread; let's use the rate gap between six-month Canadian dollar (CAD) and US dollar (USD) LIBOR divided by six-month USD LIBOR interest rate. This rate gap between two economies with so many trade and financial links has keep the Canadian dollar bid over the period and has led to downward pressures on the Canadian share of US external trade. Weakening Commodity Connection The Canadian dollar and the relative performance of the Canadian stock market had been driven by the price of physical commodities for most of the past decade; it was in fact correct to call the Canadian dollar a “commodity currency.” That relationship is deteriorating; not only is the CAD becoming much more of a straight interest rate arbitrage play, but the relative performance of the Canadian market has been declining as a function of the Dow Jones-UBS index. As I note in the chart below, what had been a linear relationship between the two markets prior to the July 2008 commodity peak has turned into something far less deterministic. If we go back to the October 2011 global market low, the Basic Materials Select SPDR (XLB) has outperformed the Canadian resource sector rather handily. Of course, the area of greatest US outperformance has been in the technology sector thanks to the struggles of Research In Motion (RIMM). As long as Canada keeps its short-term interest rates normal in an abnormal world, its financial markets will suffer from the chaperone complex: Everyone else is having a better time or at least pretending to.

Core Durable Goods Orders (ex-transportation) also decreased more than expected, reading a decline of 1.1 percent versus an estimated increase of 0.5 percent. This is essentially bearish for the manufacturing sector and negative for general economic growth in the United States. US equity futures spiked lower in pre-market trading after the worse than expected reading. According to the report, new orders for manufactured durable goods in March decreased $8.8 billion or 4.2 percent to $202.6 billion, the U.S. Census Bureau announced today. This decrease, down two of the last three months, followed a 1.9 percent February increase. Excluding transportation, new orders decreased 1.1 percent. Excluding defense, new orders decreased 4.6 percent. Inventories of manufactured durable goods in March, up twenty-seven consecutive months, increased $1.7 billion or 0.4 percent to $375.1 billion. This was at the highest level since the series was first published on a NAICS basis and followed a 0.3 percent February increase. Revised seasonally adjusted February figures for all manufacturing industries were: new orders, $467.5 billion (revised from $468.4 billion); shipments, $462.9 billion (revised from $462.6 billion); unfilled orders, $930.1 billion (revised from $931.1 billion); and total inventories, $616.7 billion (revised from $616.8 billion). ACTION ITEMS:Bullish:Traders who believe that Durable Goods Orders is a leading indicator for the US economy, you might want to consider the following trades: Short general industrial companies like Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW) or Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) as these companies will not benefit for decreasing industrial orders. Also, short Material (NYSE: XLB) companies like Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) or Alcoa (NYSE: AA) Bearish:Traders who do not believe that the manufacturing survey is a leading indicator for the general US economy, you may consider alternative positions: Long Consumer Staple companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG) and Colgate (NYSE: CL) because even if the economy is struggling, people still need to buy staple products like shampoo and toothpaste. Also, long defense contractors like Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC) because these companies may be oversold. Neither Benzinga nor its staff recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

2012-06-12,Four Obscure Sector ETFs Outperforming Bigger Rivals,"There are instances in life when size does matter - but when it comes to ETFs, size can be deceiving. Investors have a tendency to equate a fund's size with quality, but there is no empirical evidence to suggest that simply because an ETF is home to a large assets under management and robust average daily trading volume that it is a good fund. In fact, the volume argument has already been proven wrong as a plethora of thinly-traded ETFs have shown stellar returns in 2012. As for size by way of assets, that's another argument that has been discredited as there are plenty of me too ETFs that have outpaced their larger rivals. in other words, the proof is in the pudding that popularity is great in high school - but not so much with ETFs. With that, here are a few ETFs that some investors probably haven't heard about. These obscure funds are outdoing their more heralded counterparts. PowerShares Dynamic Energy Exploration & Production Portfolio (NYSE: PXE): The energy sector is one of the ideal places to find unheralded ETFs that are delivering better returns than their more popular equivalents. There's no denying that the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) and the Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSE: VDE) make for decent choices for investors looking for exposure to integrated oil stocks. Both ETFs are large, highly liquid, and feature expense ratios of just 0.18% and 0.19% respectively. Those factors don't change the fact that the PowerShares Energy Exploration & Production Portfolio, which holds many of the same stocks as XLE and VDE, is the better performer over almost all relevant time horizons. PXE is more expensive at 0.63% per year, but paying another 45 basis points in fees, investors get an ETF that has outperformed XLE and VDE year-to-date, over the past year and over the past five years. And yes, PXE outperforms its rivals by more than enough to make up for its higher fees. PowerShares NASDAQ Internet Portfolio (NASDAQ: PNQI): When it comes to ETFs that are devoted exclusively to high momentum Internet stocks such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN), investors have two choices: the larger, more widely-followed First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (NYSE: FDN) and the PowerShares Nasdaq Internet Portfolio. The two ETFs make for a compelling, if undiscovered ETF rivalry, but how intense is debatable. With $427 million in AUM, FDN is more than eight times larger than PNQI. That's not what's important. What's important is the fact that both ETFs charge 0.6% annually, but year-to-date, over the past year and over the past five years, PNQI is the winner in terms of performance - by noteworthy margins, we should add. First Trust Financials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXO): It's a daunting task for an ETF tracking bank stocks to stand out in what is a heavily crowded field, but FXO does have its perks. The five-year-old ETF has almost $172 million in AUM and its average daily volume is strong at over 473,000 shares. Still, FXO is overshadowed by the likes of the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) and the Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSE: VFH). Year-to-date, FXO has slightly lagged XLF and VFH. Over the past 90 days, the First Trust fund is in the middle of this three-fund pack. Stretch things out over a year, or five years, and FXO's dominance becomes apparent. XLF and VFH are nowhere close to FXO over those time horizons. First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ): As is the case with the financial services sector, it's hard for some materials ETFs to really standout in the face of intense competition from the dominant funds such as the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials Index Fund (NYSE: IYM). FXZ warrants consideration for the same reasons that PXE and FXO do: different index and weighting methodologies have lead to superior returns. FXZ's constituents are ranked by factors including three, six and 12-month price appreciation; sales to price and one year sales growth - and, separately, on value factors including book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets, according to First Trust. In other words, market cap isn't the sole factor in determining a stock's weight in this ETF. The combined diversity of factors delivers an ETF that has outperformed IYM and XLB over the past six months, year-to-date and over the past year. Over the past five years, FXZ is the only member of this trio to sport positive returns."
2012-06-12,How King Dollar May Plague These ETFs,"Not that long ago, many so-called experts, pundits, and traders speculated that the U.S. dollar would lose its reserve currency status. The dollar appeared to be on its way to more declines against its major rivals amid the loss of the prestigious AAA credit rating, rising deficits, and no legitimate plans to deal with entitlement spending. The combination of gold losing its safe haven status, Japan being in perhaps a worse fiscal situation than the U.S., and Europe's worsening sovereign debt crisis have helped resurrect the dollar, bolstering its reserve currency status in the process. A strong dollar has its advantages, particularly for consumers and tourists that are traveling internationally. Conversely, a rejuvenated greenback also claims plenty of victims in the financial markets. With the dollar looking poised to extend its bull run, some ETFs could be in more for pain at the hands of King Dollar. What's really important is that we're talking about more than just gold and oil funds. Consumer Discretionary SPDR (NYSE: XLY): The Consumer Discretionary SPDR would be a viable alternative, as an ETF that can stave the impact of a stronger dollar if the U.S. economy can really gain steam. That's a big if, though. Half of XLY's top-10 holdings can easily be adversely affected by a strong dollar. McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), the ETF's largest holding, is facing the double whammy of slowing global sales and a stronger buck. Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), Ford (NYSE: F), and Nike (NYSE: NKE) all have some degree of currency risk. These five stocks account for 22% of XLY's weight. As if that's not bad enough, XLY has smaller weights to high-end discretionary names such as Ralph Lauren (NYSE: RL), Coach (NYSE: COH), and Tiffany & Co. (NYSE: TIF) that are vulnerable to a slowing global economy and a stronger dollar. iShares MSCI Canada Index Fund (NYSE: EWC): This is a perception play. Canada is the largest exporter of oil to the U.S., but energy stocks aren't the largest sector allocation in EWC. Financials are - but energy names are prominent at 26.3% of Canada's largest fund's overall weight. Regarding the greenback and the loonie (the Canadian dollar), the inverse correlation has been almost perfect in the past month. UUP is 2.43%, while the CurrencyShares Canadian Dollar Trust (NYSE: FXC) is down 2.49%. Over the same time, EWC has dropped 4.4%. Market Vectors Brazil Small Cap ETF (NYSE: BRF): With the WisdomTree Dreyfus Brazilian Real ETF (NYSE: BZF) down almost 5% in the past month, nearly any ETF tracking the export-driven Brazil would be suitable for this list. The U.S. is Brazil's second-largest trading partner behind China; so, in theory, the weaker real should be helping Brazil ETFs. That hasn't been the case, as the plunging real has weighed on BRF - 47% of its fund is allocated to discretionary and industrial names. Traders have shown that when they deport exotic currencies such as the real, they head to the dollar. Short real/long dollar is a problem for Brazil equity funds. It's that simple. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB): Materials stocks are an obvious strong dollar victim. XLB's constituents are primarily American companies, but they garner healthy revenue percentages overseas. In other words - a weak dollar is a catalyst for materials stocks, just as it is for the futures prices of many of the commodities that these companies produce. With Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold (NYSE: FCX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) among its top-10 holdings, metals and mining names account for almost 23% of XLB's weight. That's enough enough to validate XLB as a strong dollar play... from the short side. For more on ETFs with ties to the U.S. dollar, please click here."
2012-06-15,"Goldman Highlights ETF Correlations (XLF, XLK, XLU)","In a note out today, Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) said investors are continuing to increase usage of ETFs as hedging tools, a move that is creating unintended consequences to their portfolios. Goldman notes that managers and analysts are increasingly creating less-than-desirable hedges due, in part, to surprisingly high correlations among some sector funds. We see high trailing 3-month daily correlations among less-than-obvious pairs of sectors, including: Financials & Industrials, Tech & Discretionary and Materials & Discretionary, Goldman said. The recent performances of the various Select Sector SPDR funds indicate that Goldman's note highlights valid points. In the past three months, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) is down 9.7% compared to 8.8% for the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI). The three-month gap is wider between the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) and the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY), which are down 5.8% and 3.3%, respectively. Over the past three months, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is down 7.5%. Indeed, of the 36 sector ETF pairs we examined, correlations on a 3-year basis are higher than 70% for 31 of the instances, emphasizing the importance for portfolio managers to choose sectors wisely when hedging at specific points in time, Goldman said in the note. Over the past three months, Goldman says XLB and XLI are most correlated at a rate of 88%. XLB and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) are next at 86%. The following pairs have been 85% correlated over the past three months: XLB-XLY, XLF-XLI and XLK-XLY. Goldman's research indicates money managers looking to avoid intense sector correlations should opt for pairs involving low-beta sectors such as utilities and consumer staples. In the past three months, the the pairs with lowest correlations all involve the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU). The pairs are the following: XLK-XLU at 33% and XLF-XLU and XLB-XLU each at 47%. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) has a three-month correlation of 60% to XLE and a 65% correlation to XLK. Correlations rise when the time frame is expanded to three years. Goldman's data shows that the five most correlated pairs over three years move together 90% of the time. For example, the three-year correlation for XLY-XLI is 94%. The pairs of XLB-XLI and XLK-XLY are at 92%. XLF-XLI and XLB-XLE are each at 90%. The bottom five pairs in terms of correlation over the past three years include three with XLU. XLF-XLU has a three-year correlation of 60%. XLB-XLU rises slightly to 63% while XLK-XLU is at 64%. XLF-and XLP have a three-year correlation of 71% while XLF and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV) are correlated 73%. Investors may view health care stocks and ETFs such as XLV as low-beta and having low correlations to other sectors, but Goldman shows that's not the case. While 32 of the examined 36 sector pairs showed decreases in correlations, all of the four that showed increases included Healthcare. As an example, correlations between Healthcare and Financials rose to 76% from 73%, versus an average decrease in correlations of 8% among all 36 pairs, Goldman said in the note. Relative to the S&P 500 over the past three months, XLU, XLP and XLK are least correlated to the broader market index, Goldmand said. Energy as represented by XLE saw its three-month correlation to the S&P 500 jump to 62% compared to 56% over the past three years. Tech (XLK) and discretionary (XLY) saw the largest declines in correlations against the S&P 500, falling to 47% from 60% and 50% from 58%, respectively, on a 3-month and 3-year basis."
2012-06-19,Short US Steel Before Pensions Go Bust,"Some stocks are more dangerous than others. In an anemic economic environment, the most dangerous stocks are those with issues that are lurking behind the scenes or in footnotes. Too often, investors are willing to invest without much diligence when times are good. But when times get tough, more are willing to roll up their sleeves and do some old-fashioned analysis. U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) is an example of a stock that could see significant additional downward pressure as more investors become aware of the $5.2 billion in liabilities related to its “Pension Benefits”, “Other Benefits” and “Other postemployment benefits” plans, which I will bundle under the term “pensions” for the remainder of this article. A loophole in GAAP accounting minimizes, at least temporarily, the impact of big pension liabilities on reported earnings. Eventually, however, these issues can hurt earnings and surprise investors if the company does not take measures to get them under control. In a challenging economic environment, taking appropriate measures is not always feasible. As Warren Buffett famously said, “when the water is drained out of the pool, you see who is not wearing trunks”. My fear is that US Steel’s pension liabilities will eventually manifest in downward earnings revisions that will drive the stock down. Accounting loopholes can provide a short-term boost to earnings, but they can also lead to a long-term drag or possible bankruptcy. Eastman Kodak (EKDKQ.PK) used the same trick to prop up its 2010 earnings, and now it is bankrupt just as I predicted in my March 2011 article “Dead Company Walking: Sell Eastman Kodak”. Pension Accounting Boosts EPS US Steel boosted its 2011 earnings by increasing its expected return on plan assets (“EROPA”) assumption for its pensions to 7.79%[1], up from 7.75% in 2010. Page F-40 in US Steel’s 2011 10-K filing has the details. An EROPA of 7.79% is abnormally high. Out of the 1,021 companies with pensions that I cover, 90% of them have a lower EROPA. Only 96 of the 1,021 raised their EROPAs in 2012 while 525 lowered and 400 made no changes. US Steel’s EROPA assumption is not only among the highest but it is also rising when the majority is falling. Raising its EROPA in 2012 looks worse when compared to my estimates of the company’s actual return on plan assets. I estimate 2011’s actual return on plan assets was 4.96%. I estimate the average return over the last five years is also 4.96%. Over the last ten years, it is 6.30%. These estimates are based on dividing the “Actual return on plan assets” by the “Beginning balance” of plan assets. You can replicate my analysis using data from the company’s annual reports as detailed in the model used to calculate the actual return on plan assets, which is based on data from the 2001 – 2011 10-Ks. US Steel’s investor relations contact, Dan Lesnak, asserted that the company’s EROPA assumption was not high compared to actual historical returns. When I shared my analysis of the actual returns going back to 2001, he said that I was not looking at a long enough time horizon. When I asked for the appropriate time horizon, he would not provide one. Nevertheless, Mr. Lesnak’s assertion is consistent with this statement on page 57 of the 10-K in reference to using a 7.75% EROPA for 2012: “Actual returns since the inception of the plans have exceeded this 7.75 percent rate and while some recent annual returns have not, it is U. S. Steel’s expectation that rates will return to this level in future periods.” In my opinion, that is a rather big expectation given that 30-40% of plan assets are in corporate bonds, Treasury bonds and government-backed mortgages, which are not offering yields anywhere near 7.75%. The remainder of plan assets are in equities, which will have to earn 9.8% for the portfolio return to be 7.75% assuming a 70/30 equity/fixed income split and a 3% yield on the fixed income. I think most professional money managers would be happy with 9.8% return over the same long-term time frame assumed for the EROPA. Pensions Can Have Big Impact On EPS And Cash Since US Steel’s pensions are so large, its pension costs play a prominent role in earnings, much more so than most companies. US Steel’s net periodic benefit cost (the cost attributable to pensions with the current EROPA reported in GAAP earnings) is over 3% of revenue. We cannot analyze how large a part of net income the net periodic benefit expense is because X’s net income was negative in 2011. However, given that net income margins are at best in the high single digits, it is safe to say that, at 3% of revenue, US Steel’s net periodic benefit cost has a big impact on the company’s financial bottom line. A high EROPA enables US Steel to lower the costs it must report in earnings for paying into its pensions. In turn, the company’s overall expenses are lower and accounting earnings are higher. A 0.5% decrease in US Steel’s EROPA would wipe away $0.23 per basic shares outstanding. A 0.5% reduction to a 7.29% EROPA would be below the median (7.5%) EROPA for the 1,021 pensions we analyzed. It would still be significantly above my estimate of the company’s actual return on plan assets over the last ten years. Note that US Steel has been making significant cash contributions, not reflected in EPS, to its pensions. In 2011, the company contributed $626 million to its pension obligations, compared to $534 million in 2010 and $658 million in 2009. Those are big numbers, especially to maintain over a long period, for a company whose reported cash flows were negative in 2011 and 2010. Since 2009, the company’s cash and cash equivalents declined from $1,218 million to $408 million at the end of fiscal 2011. Pensions Are Underfunded by $5.2 billion US Steel’s pensions were under-funded by $5.2 billion as of 12/31/2011. The sum of the “net funded status” for the “Pension Benefits” and “Other Benefits” plans on page F-38 of the company’s 2011 10-K shows $5.1 billion in underfunded status. An additional $100 million in underfunded obligations to employees is found near the bottom of page F-48. All together, $5.2 billion is about 1.5 times the company’s market cap. For comparison, American Airlines’ (AAMRQ.PK) pensions were underfunded by $8.1 billion coming out of 2010, and it filed bankruptcy about 11 months later with its pensions underfunded by about $10 billion, not a good precedent for US Steel. Part of the increase in the underfunded level of X’s pension is due to lower discount rates used to determine the value of its pension obligations. These discount rates are based on “certain corporate bond rates” according to page 57 in the 2011 10-K. The discount rate in 2011 was lowered to 4.5% from 5.0% for most of its “pension” liabilities. Accordingly, a meaningful rise in corporate bond rates would meaningfully reduce the pension obligations and the underfunded level of US Steel’s pensions. Such a rise would be a welcome sign as would also likely correspond with a rebound in economic activity. I am not sure, however, if we can expect either anytime in the next couple of years. Doubtful That US Steel Can Grow Its Way Out Of Its Liabilities If US Steel were in a high growth industry with excellent prospects for future profits, one could argue that the company could eventually earn its way out of the underfunded pensions hole. That is a tough argument for a company in such a competitive and low margin business. Worse yet, my financial model suggests that US Steel is more unprofitable than reported GAAP earnings suggest, even if one assumes its EROPA is fair and accurate. Figure 1 compares US Steel’s economic earnings to its accounting earnings. In 2011, US Steel reported -$53 million in accounting losses while I believe the company’s losses were closer to -$1,050 million. Figure 1: Accounting Profits Are Not Truly Indicative Of Financial Health Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings One of the largest drivers of the differences in reported accounting and economic earnings for US Steel is $1.1 billion in off-balance sheet reserves (about 33% of the company’s market cap). In addition, US Steel is in a very capital-intensive business and generates relatively little cash compared to the amount of invested capital in the business. From where I sit, the company is in a tough spot. It is not making much, if any, money and its liabilities are formidable: pensions at $5.2 billion plus total debt of $4.4 billion equals $9.6 billion. Stock Valuation Could Suffocate Under Looming Liabilities Assuming that US Steel’s liabilities do not increase, equity investors should be intimidated by the $9.6 billion in existing liabilities that have a senior claim on the company’s future profits. If US Steel does generate future profits, those profits have to be large enough to cover the $9.6 billion in senior claims plus the expectations baked into the current stock price before equity investors can make significant money in US Steel. For those that say all of this information is already baked into the stock price, I suggest you look again. According to my discounted cash flow model, to justify the stock valuation at $18.41/share, the company has to grow its after-tax cash flow (NOPAT) by 9% compounded annually for over 15 years. That is a rather high growth rate for a long time for a commodity business. I underscore that those are the expectations baked into the current stock price. For investors to believe US Steel deserves a higher valuation/stock price, they must believe that the company’s future profit growth will be even greater than that baked into the current stock price. I would say the odds are rather low that US Steel can meet the current expectations baked into the stock price and the odds are rather high the company’s future profits will be much lower than what the market expects. Footnotes Diligence Pays In summary, using the footnotes to lift the accounting veil on US Steel’s financial situation reveals some earnings and liabilities issues for a stock that is already expensive and could suffer downward pressure when investors become more aware of these issues.

2012-06-27,S&P Bearish on Materials ETFs,"S&P Capital IQ downgraded its rating on the materials sector to Underweight from Marketweight on Europe's worsening sovereign debt crisis and slowing emerging markets growth today, and the research firm has a similarly bearish view on several marquee materials ETFs. For chemicals, the largest Materials sector industry group, representing 54% of market capitalization in the S&P 500 Materials sector as of June 22, the team has a positive fundamental outlook due to potential for higher pricing as long as economic growth worldwide continues to look sufficient, S&P Capital IQ said in a research note. On the downside, S&P notes that chemicals producers could face increased risks if global growth continues to wane because the firms are highly exposed to international demand trends. S&P Capital IQ has three-star ratings on Dow component DuPont (NYSE: DD), Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW), Air Products (NYSE: APD) and Airgas (NYSE: ARG). Those four stocks combine for almost 23 percent of the Materials Select Sector SPDR's (NYSE: XLB) weight. XLB, the largest materials ETF, with over $1.9 billion in assets under management, is rated Underweight by S&P. The ETF, which has an expense ratio of 0.18 percent, has lost 8.2 percent in the past three months. Some of the fund's other top-10 holdings include Monsanto (NYSE: MON), Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX). S&P also has an Underweight rating on the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal-Weight Materials ETF (NYSE: RTM). DuPont, Dow Chemical, Airgas and Air Products combine for about 13 percent of that ETF's weight. RTM has almost $31.3 million in assets under management and charges an expense ratio of 0.5 percent. The fund has lost 10.8 percent in the past 90 days. The First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ) also landed an Underweight rating from S&P. That ETF's chemicals exposure stands at 52 percent of its overall weight though DuPont, Dow, Airgas and Air Products represent just 5 percent FXZ's weight. FXZ's top holdings are CF Industries (NYSE: CF) and Valspar (NYSE: VAL). The $172 million fund, which charges 0.7 percent annually and is home to 57 stocks, is the worst-performer over the past three months of the trio of ETFs mentioned in the S&P note. Over that time, FXZ has tumbled 13.1 percent."

2012-07-10,"4 ETFs For Q2 Earnings Season (FXD, IYW, XLB)","With Dow component Alcoa (NYSE: AA) reporting earnings after the bell on Monday, another earnings season has officially arrived. Following a glum June jobs report, traders and investors might be looking to corporate earnings report to lift stocks and spur a summertime rally, but the statistics indicate the rosiest of scenarios are off the table. As of July 6, 85 S&P 500 constituents warned their results would not meet Wall Street expectations. The quarter's expected earnings growth of 5.8 percent is entirely due to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), according to Reuters. Bank of America's contribution comes courtesy of one-time gains. The NBA market is back: Nothing but Apple. Even with Apple being the primary driver of S&P 500 earnings once again, a plethora of other companies and sectors will be under intense scrutiny this earnings season. Here are some of the ETF plays that could standout for both good and bad reasons in the coming weeks. iShares Dow Jones U.S. Technology Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYW) The iShares Dow Jones U.S. Technology Sector Index Fund has steadily gained notoriety for one simple reason: It is the ETF with the largest allocation to Apple. Beyond the 23.8 percent weight to Apple, IYW will be in focus this earnings season. Micorsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), the world's largest software company and 9.5 percent of IYW's weight, has already warned on its upcoming profit report, but dark clouds for IYW may not end there. Last week, BMO Capital cut its 2012 revenue estimates on IBM (NYSE: IBM) and EMC (NYSE: EMC) among others. IBM and EMC combine for 11 percent of IYW's weight. Arguably, Apple will have to do all of the heavy lifting for IYW this earnings season. Market Vectors Oil Services ETF (NYSE: OIH) Oil services earnings do not kick into high gear until July 20 when Schlumberger (NYSE: SLB), the world's largest provider of oilfield services, reports its second-quarter results. It is worth noting OIH (or a rival fund) makes frequent appearances on these ETFs for earnings season lists. Helmerich & Payne (NYSE: HP) and Pioneer Drilling (NYSE: PDC) issued weaker outlooks last week. Halliburton (NYSE: HAL) (in early June) said rising guar gum prices would suppress second quarter margins. Add to that, amid surging output and falling prices for natural gas liquids, exploration and production companies are expected to pare their capital budgets, which spells bad news for service providers. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) Despite the highly cyclical nature of its constituency, the Materials Select Sector SPDR has held up well in recent weeks. A gain of one percent in the past month for an ETF like this is nothing to scoff at given the spate of weak economic data the market has had to digest. Many of XLB's holdings should be benefiting from lower energy prices, but with the outlook for the global economy tepid at best, this ETF and others like it are being held hostage by macroeconomic headwinds. If companies such as DuPont (NYSE: DD), Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) can provide investors with positive earnings surprises, then the risk-on trade could easily be renewed. Problem is, that is a tough bet to make. First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXD) More so than the rival Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY), the First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX has fallen victim to weak economic data. FXD is down more 1.1 percent in the past month while XLY is up a third of a percent over the same time. Home to 125 stocks, FXD allocates no more than 1.45 percent to any individual holding. How the ETF weights its component is not a problem. In fact, FXD's methodology would be a selling point in a bull market. The ETF's downside potential is derived from an almost 26 percent allocation to specialty retail names, an almost 12 percent to hotel and restaurant stocks and a nearly nine percent weight to the auto industry (manufacturers and suppliers). That leaves FXD extremely vulnerable to slack economic data."
2012-07-13,"Chinese GDP Slows in Second Quarter, Lowest Growth Rate in 3 Years","Chinese GDP growth slowed to the lowest level in three years during the second quarter. China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that the economy grew at a 7.6 percent annualized rate in the second quarter, slower than the growth rate in the first quarter of 8.1 percent. Chinese GDP reflects the weak data seen earlier this week. China reported that trade balances fell in June, showing that the global economy is continuing to slow. The GDP data furthers the bearish China thesis, as GDP growth is now only 1.3 percent above the lowest levels of 2008, when GDP growth was a mere 6.2 percent in the first quarter of 2009. Also released was Chinese industrial production data which showed that the manufacturing sector, China's largest, continued to slow in the second quarter. China reported that industrial production grew 9.5 percent in June as compared to a year ago missing economist estimates of a 9.8 percent rise. This was also a slower pace of growth than May's reported 9.6 percent. A continued slowdown in China's economy does not bode well for global growth. As the chart below shows, Chinese GDP growth tends to lead U.S. and German GDP growth. German GDP growth is a proxy for the Eurozone as a whole, which is the world's largest economy and China's largest trading partner. Now that China, the world's third largest economy, is slowing, it probably will lead to further slowdowns in other large economies. Industrial and manufacturing companies in the U.S. would see a slowdown in orders, and any slowdown should be reflected in the SPDR Industrials ETF (NYSE: XLI). Also, materials stocks should weaken as Chinese demand for commodities slows, which can be seen in the SPDR Basic Materials ETF (NYSE: XLB). Also, the dollar tends to rally in risk-off environments and could do so once again. Investors could buy the Powershares Bullish dollar ETF to express this thesis (NYSE: UUP)."
2012-07-23,"U.S. Futures Edge Lower Amid Fresh Europe, China Worries","U.S. stock market futures lowered about 1 percent lower early Monday amid renewed fears of recession and Greek's insolvency as well as a growth slowdown in China. Flight to safety trades are on, and risky assets are being sold off globally. The 10-year U.S. Treasury reaching an all-time low of 1.41 percent in London trading. The S&P 500 could soon fall out of its uptrend marked by the June and July lows. Volume support in the 1320 to 1325 could come into play in this week's trading. Below that, traders also will have an eye on key a near-term technical retracement level at 1310. European markets are being hit hard in the early going. The International Monetary Fund will stop paying further rescue aid to Greece, according to Der Spiegel magazine in Germany on Sunday, citing European Union officials with knowledge of the matter. That has only increased fears that the debt-strapped nation will not be able to meet debt-reduction targets, and that it will request more aid that from other countries that is likely to go unfulfilled. A funding shortfall could lead to insolvency as soon as September. The euro fell for a fourth day versus the dollar, as other nations in Europe also fell hard on recession fears. Italian stocks hit all-time lows in the intraday session early Monday, with bank stocks among the hardest hit. Large banks including UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo were suspended from trading after hitting 10 percent loss limits. 10-year Italian government bonds rose another 25 bps to 7.45. Fresh concerns about a Chinese economic slowdown also are weighing on the markets. The Shanghai Index is now trading at its lowest levels since March 2009. An official said economic growth will likely slow this quarter. Japan cut its economic outlook for China, it's largest Asian trading partner. In the U.S. banking stocks will be in the spotlight. The weekly open and close of the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) last week eclipsed the prior week's open and closing range, a negative near-term trading signal. Morgan Stanley shares are among those threatening to trade at their lowest levels since last October. Materials issues also will be in focus amid the new concerns in China, possibly giving back gains made in four of the past six trading sessions. Up-trending support at the lows from May through July on the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) will be closely watched. Tech stocks are expected to be affected less by the day's news from China and Europe. Tech will also be in focus, ahead of Texas Instruments (NYSE: TXN) expected report on Monday, Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) earnings on Tuesday, and Facebook's (NYSE: FB) first report as a public company on Thursday. McDonald's (NYSE: MCD)'s reports Monday morning, and investors will be closely monitoring the company's results in Europe. Analysts are expecting EPS of $1.37 on average, up slightly from the $1.35 a share it reported in the year-ago quarter."

2012-09-21,Hard Asset Boom Could Lift These ETFs,"Financial markets do enjoy news of quantitative easing. U.S. equities proved as much last Thursday when the Federal Reserve unveiled the latest version in what is now a trilogy of monetary stimulus. Part of the rub with QE in any form is that it is good for lifting near-term sentiment, but too much easing can have dour long-term consequences. First and foremost is the potential for increased inflation. Inflation is not good because it diminishes the purchasing power of the dollar. That could mean a dollar will not buy the same amount of coffee, gold, oil, platinum, silver, etc. in five or ten years as it does today. It is an obvious trade. Hard assets rise in price, leading investors to covet the shares of quality hard asset producers. There is no dearth of materials ETFs on the market today with which to play this trend, but there are some not-so-obvious candidates that merit consideration. FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index ETF (NYSE: GUNR) The FlexShares Morningstar Global Upstream Natural Resources Index ETF debuted a year ago and with almost $515 million in assets under management, it is fair to say this is one of the most successful ETFs that launched last year. Calling GUNR obscure, is clearly inaccurate and unfair, but it is fair to say the fund does not receive the same notoriety as other materials-focused ETFs. Popularity aside, GUNR merits consideration as an ETF that will benefit from rising hard asset prices. The ETF is a plethora of materials and natural resources equities. Agri-business and integrated oil names combine for half of the fund's weight, but the ETF also features a 16.7 weight to diversified mining firms and an 8.7 percent allocation to gold miners. Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), the largest U.S. oil company, is GUNR's largest individual holding with a weight of almost 5.4 percent. GUNR is up 10.1 percent this year, easily outpacing the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) in the process. Market Vectors RVE Hard Assets Producers ETF (NYSE: HAP) As is the case with GUNR, the Market Vectors RVE Hard Assets Producers ETF is home to a robust AUM total ($146.2 million), but HAP is also an example of a hard assets fund that does not draw much acclaim. HAP and GUNR are similar in that both offer broad-based exposure to multiple materials and natural resources sub-sectors. For those investors that think the 120 stocks held by GUNR is not enough, HAP holds nearly triple that amount. However, HAP is not diverse as GUNR as the former allocates a combined 82 percent of its weight to energy and materials names. Top-10 holdings include Exxon, Monsanto (NYSE: MON), Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan (NYSE: POT) and BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP), so there is some duplication with GUNR. HAP is also slightly more expensive with fees of 0.49 percent compared to 0.48 percent for GUNR. First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ) The First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund is proof positive that index methodology can make a difference in an ETF's return. On the surface, FXZ would appear to be an also ran next to the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW), just to name a pair. For starters, FXZ is not tiny with almost $176 million in assets under management. There are some moving parts to this ETF's index methodology, but to describe it simple terms, the bottom 25 percent of the Russell 1000 Materials and Processing Index are eliminated. The selected stocks are divided into quintiles based on their rankings and the top ranked quintiles receive a higher weight within the index. The stocks are equally-weighted within each quintile, according to First Trust. That means FXZ features some of the same constituents as XLB and VAW, but with vastly different weights. Asking why First Trust uses this is methodology is not important. Asking about the result is. Year-to-date, in the past year and over the past five years, XLB and VAW come nowhere FXZ in terms of generating alpha. For more on ETFs, click here."
2012-09-21,ETF Showdown: Materials Melee ,"The materials sector accounts for just 3.5 percent of the S&P 500's weight, making it the third-smallest sector in the broader market index ahead of only utilities and telecommunications. Even with that factoid, there are plenty of materials ETFs for investors to choose from. Including the inverse and leveraged products, there are nearly 60 materials ETFs on the market today. No two materials ETFs are exactly the same, but the major funds tracking producers of basic materials such as DuPont (NYSE: DD) and FreeportMcMoRan (NYSE: FCX) have a lot in common. The iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYM), Materials Select Sectors SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW) are not triplets, but one is not vastly different from the other. These are standard, passively managed cap-weighted funds. That approach has worked well at least in terms of attracting assets. In the case of XLB, the ETF has almost $2.5 billion in AUM. Impressive, but a smaller fund that does things a little bit differently is a worthy competitor to XLB and IYM and VAW for that matter. Just look at how the First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ) stacks up against XLB. XLB uses the traditional cap-weighted methodology found in so many ETFs. There is nothing wrong with this approach as it keeps costs down, but it does mean a stock's size is often the most important criteria for inclusion in the ETF. Regarding size, it is not surprising to see Monsanto and DuPont each accounting for 10.4 percent of XLB's weight. Freeport and Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) combine for 16 percent of the fund's weight. That is four stocks representing a 37 percent of one ETF. The First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund, which is just over five-years-old compared to almost 14-years-old for XLB, does things differently. Home to 57 stocks, FXZ devotes no more than 3.2 percent of its weight to any single holding. FXZ has duplicate holdings with XLB such as DuPont, Dow and Freeport. However, the AlphaDEX selection methodology ensures FXZ is much different than XLB. The AlphaDEX methodology is not active management per se, but it does employ quality screens on potential constituents for ETFs such as FXZ. FXZ tracks the NYSE Euronext constructs the StrataQuant Materials Index, which uses the AlphaDEX methodology. That ranks Russell 1000 members on metrics such as three, six and 12-month price appreciation, cash flow, book value, return on assets and others. The stocks are scored and ranked with the bottom 25 percent being tossed aside and the selected stocks are divided into quintiles based on their rankings and the top ranked quintiles receive a higher weight within the index, according to First Trust. That is how FXZ is put together. Not surprisingly, this way of constructing an ETF is pricy compared to the usual cap-weighted methodology. FXZ has annual fees of 0.7 percent compared to just 0.18 percent for XLB. FXZ is also slightly more volatile than XLB. This is a reward for the elevated volatility and higher fees: Over the past quarter, year and year-to-date FXZ has outperformed XLB by health margins, proving the AlphaDEX methodology is worth considering.

2012-10-05,AlphaDEX ETFs do Things Differently With Stellar Results,"First Trust, the Illinois-based ETF sponsor, is a major issuer of sector funds. As most investors know, there is no shortage of sector ETFs on the market today and this territory long dominated by the biggest fund sponsors, namely State Street's (NYSE: STT) select sector SPDRs along with sector funds issued by iShares and Vanguard. That is tough territory to encroach upon, but First Trust has done just that with its AlphaDEX funds that eschew the usual cap-weighting methodology in favor of using other valuation metrics to construct ETF indexes. The strategy has proven efficacious. Not only have an array of First AlphaDEX ETF proven proficient in terms of gaining assets under management, some have outperformed iShares, SPDR and Vanguard rivals over time. We're more selective in our approach, said First Trust ETF Strategist and Senior Vice President Ryan Issakainen in an interview with Benzinga from the Morningstar ETF Conference in Chicago. We're overweighting in terms of investment merit. Over time, these attributes predict relative outperformance. We consider momentum and valuation factors that have been vetted and passed through some rigor. The AlphaDEX methodology includes ranking members of various Russell 1000 sectors on growth factors including three, six and 12-month price appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, and, separately, on value factors including book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets, as First Trust notes on the AlphaDEX funds' web sites. AlphaDEX has worked for some First Trust sector funds. For example, the First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ) has outpaced the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) over the past year, quarter and year-to-date. Still, the AlphaDEX funds are not as large as their counterparts and in most cases are not as voluminous. The First Trust AlphaDEX Energy Fund (NYSE: FXN) has $134.5 million in AUM compared to $7.2 billion for the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE). The First Trust AlphaDEX Health Care Fund (NYSE: FXH) has average daily volume of 138,000 shares while Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV) has average turnover of almost 4.8 million shares. Issakainen notes that the AlphaDEX ETFs have been well received by investors. The ETFs are penetrating registered investment advisors and asset management firms, he said. They're using AlphaDEX funds more now. The AlphaDEX sector funds have been out for more than five years and we now how they perform in different environments. The statistics support Issakainen's view that investors are warming to the AlphaDEX methodology. FXH has $642.5 million in AUM. The First Trust Consumer Staples AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXG) has $360.9 million in assets. The First Trust Financials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXO) has nearly $187 million in assets. Those are all numbers that imply the AlphaDEX sector funds are not only surviving, but thriving as well. Due to AlphaDEX sector funds avoiding excessive weights to just one or two stocks, there are times when the funds can lag traditionally weighted ETFs. The technology sector provides a good example. Year-to-date,the First Trust Technology AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXL) is up 8.3 percent. FXL currently has a weight of just 1.9 percent to Apple. On the other hand, the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Technology Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYW) is up nearly 19 percent this year. That fund features the largest allocation of any ETF to Apple with a current weight of 24.2 percent. There will be times when AlphaDEX funds trail, particularly during risk averse environments, said Issakainen. If we're underweight big, safe stocks, we can underperform, but that is not the case the majority of the time. He is right about that. Over the past five years, a brutal time for bank stocks, FXO is off 16.3 percent compared to a 53 percent plunge for the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF). Since May 2007, the debut month of FXH, that ETF has surged over 70 percent, but XLV is up just 14 percent. In the past year, FXN has delivered almost 400 basis points in additional alpha compared to XLE and has topped the Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSE: VDE) by more than 500 basis points.

2012-10-09,Investors Cheating Themselves by Focusing on Largest ETFs,"In the ETF game, size matters. As the exchange-traded products industry has evolved, professional and retail investors alike have become more obsessed with numbers. Underscoring the notion that a herd mentality still permeates financial markets, investors tend to find comfort in the largest, most heavily traded ETFs because those ETFs are big and heavily traded. That is the case despite the fact that compelling evidence exists to suggest that bigger is rarely better when it comes to ETFs. Perhaps what is most vexing is that this scenario is not confined to just one area of the ETF world. The conversation is not limited to a couple of China ETFs outperforming the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI) or a fund or two being better alternatives than one of the sector SPDRs. The examples of small ETFs turning in stellar performances are too numerous to completely detail here. There are some standouts worth examining, though. For example, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund (NASDAQ: IBB) is, by most metrics, a fine ETF. Home to $2.5 billion in assets under management, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index Fund is the largest biotech ETF on the market. It has also performed quite well this year with a gain of 39.7 percent. Chances are, few investors – professional or retail – would complain about making 40 percent in less than 10 months. On the other hand, those investors, particularly the retail crowd paying fees to advisors, probably would not be pleased to know that of the four major biotech ETFs, IBB is the worst performer on a year-to-date basis. The fund IBB is closest to in terms of performance, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE: XBI), has outpaced IBB by over 300 basis points. The First Trust NYSE Arca Biotech Index Fund (NYSE: FBT) has topped IBB by 660 basis points. A biotech ETF that rarely gets the credit it deserves, the Market Vectors Biotech ETF (NYSE: BBH), has jumped almost 58 percent this year in near stealth fashion. Proving that the bigger is not always better argument lingers across multiple sectors, there is the example of the First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ). At least this ETF has drawn some praise for trumping its rivals. That is exactly what FXZ has done this year. In 2012, FXZ has topped the Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW) by 150 basis points and the Select Sector Materials SPDR (NYSE: XLB) by almost 480 basis points. Moving on from sector funds, broad market ETFs focused on a particular cap spectrum also give investors bigger is not always better examples. Take the case of the Guggenheim Wilshire Micro-Cap ETF (NYSE: WMCR). That ETF has just $13.4 million in assets under management compared to $478.6 million for the iShares Russell Microcap Index Fund (NYSE: IWC). Chances are if Joe Six Pack asked his financial advisor to put him into a micro-cap ETF, the advisor would choose IWC because its large by assets and has decent volume for these type of ETFs at almost 80,000 shares per day. Joe would have every right to be mad at his advisor because the choice means being cheated out of almost 700 basis points of alpha this year. Arguably, three examples is enough to make investors wonder if all they are getting with large ETFs is a security blanket by way of size. In the process, their returns may be suffering.

2012-10-22,A Look Ahead: This Week's ETFs to Watch,"A calamitous week on Wall Street ended with stocks plunging on Friday, the 25th anniversary of the Black Monday debacle. Perhaps that was just a coincidence. Maybe it was not. Either way, U.S. stocks endured the worst one-day performance since June. The good news is Black Monday was not repeated last Friday because a 23 percent plunge for the Dow would equal 3,000 points. Concerns about global growth the pesky European sovereign debt crisis are once again ebbing to the forefront of investors' minds. Less-than-stellar earnings reports are not helping matters, either. On Friday, it was Dow components General Electric (NYSE: GE) and McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), among others, that roiled the market. On the bright side, yields on Italian and Spanish bond yields fell on Friday. The cautionary tale for the week ahead is that Asian shares are already pointing significantly lower as of Sunday evening. With that, here are just a few of the ETFs that will be in play in this week. U.S. Natural Gas Fund (NYSE: GAS) Ever volatile, the U.S. Natural Gas Fund finished Friday up almost 0.6 percent, but that was disappointing considering UNG traded up by as much as 1.5 percent during the session. Still, Friday's action highlights a positive about UNG that is often overlooked: A low correlation to equities. In fact, UNG's one-year correlation to the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) is negative 0.69. Predictions of cooler weather along the East Coast could also provide some near-term help to UNG. ProShares UltraShort FTSE China 25 (NYSE: FXP) The rebound in long China ETFs has plagued FXP over the past seven weeks. There is another side to the story. The aforementioned rally in China ETFs has been fast and furious with some of the funds jumping 10 percent or more in just one month. ETFs can remain overbought for extended periods of time, so there are no guarantees a significant pullback for China funds is in the works. However, many of these ETFs do look overbought. Friday's price action indicates as much so it would not be a bad idea to hedge a trade in a traditional long China ETF with FXP. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) An earnings play in the spotlight. The Materials Select Sector SPDR could see increased activity as top-10 holdings DuPont (NYSE: DD), Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) and Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) all report this week. The order is Freeport, DuPont and Dow. Those three stocks combine for 27 percent of XLB's weight. XLB is also a good gauge of risk appetite in the broader market. If the ETF falls below support at $36.50, selling pressure will likely intensify. Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI) See above. With Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), Boeing (NYSE: BA), 3M (NYSE: MMM) and United Technologies (NYSE: UTX) reporting this week, over 18 percent of XLI's weight is heading to the earnings confessional. All of these stocks are represent accurate temperature checks on the broader economy. Caterpillar's comments about domestic and global demand when it reports Monday could see the weekly deal for XLI. A good report from the construction equipment maker should boost XLI. If the alternative scenario comes to pass, then the alternative result will as well. For more on ETFs, click here."
2012-11-01,These ETFs Could Soar in November,"Mercifully, a rough October for the bulls has drawn to a close. The better news is that November has a reputation for being kind to stocks. After all, the eleventh month of the year is the first month in the strongest six-month cycle in which to own stocks. Better still is the fact that this is a presidential election year and November has been the best month of the year in which to own stocks in that scenario for more than 10 elections. Since 1950, November is tied with April as the second-best month of performance for the S&P 500 with an average gain of 1.5 percent, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. Of course, some sectors outperform others at any point during the year and that is certainly the case in November. For example, over the past 25 Novembers, the energy and natural resources sectors have only posted monthly gains 11 times. So this probably is not the month to go running to the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) or the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). The following represent some of the better ideas at the sector for the month of November. iShares Dow Jones US Telecom Index Fund (NYSE: IYZ) Already being touted as a viable play on an Obama reelection, IYZ and comparable ETFs are in the sweet spot of favorable seasonal trends. In Novembers dating back to 1987, the telecom sector has posted up months 16 of 25 times with a mean gain of 1.67 percent, according to Allocationforlife.com. That number is slightly skewed by an almost 11 percent gain in 1999 and a plunge of nearly 22 percent in 2000, but telecom names perform well in November. Period. An Obama reelection could just be icing on the cake for IYZ, the Vanguard Telecommunications ETF (NYSE: VOX) and related funds. PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ) With the way Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) lately (off almost 11 percent in the past month), shying away from ETFs heavy on the technology sector might seem like a smart move. Seasonally speaking, it is not a good idea. With an average gain of 1.6 percent in Novembers dating back to 1971, only two months of the year, January and December, are more kind to the Nasdaq. As luck would have it, traders will quickly be able to figure out what November 2012 has in store for QQQ. The ETF is currently found resting at critical support. That support level is also QQQ's 200-day moving average. If that gives out, QQQ could have significant downside ahead. If buyers step in and do so quickly, QQQ should rally into the first quarter. The tech sector has climbed in 15 of the past 25 Novembers. Market Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF (NYSE: PPH) Like IYZ, the Market Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF is perceived to be a low-beta play and low-beta has worked this year. PPH shares some other things in common with telecom ETFs. The pharmaceuticals fund has given back some of its gain recently and this ETF is another one that could see near-term upside if President Obama wins reelection. And like the telecom sector, health care has a penchant for performing well in November. The sector has climbed in 17 of the past 25 Novembers, according to Allocationforlife. Regarding PPH, the ETF is different today than it was when it debuted in 2000 (it used to be HOLDRs ETF), it is worth noting the fund has risen in nine Novembers since 2000. First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXD) Holiday shopping is certainly one reason why discretionary tend to perform well in November. That thesis may seem too simple to be profitable, but it has worked as the consumer discretionary sector has risen in about two-thirds of the previous 25 Novembers. November bullishness for discretionary stocks and ETFs can be the start of more upside through year-end and into the first quarter as well. As for the First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund, the ETF has lagged more traditional cap-weighted discretionary ETFs this year. However, FXD has some traits worth acknowledging. First, no stock accounts for more than 1.58 percent of the ETF's weight, meaning the fund is not excessively exposed to the whims of just one or two stocks. Second, First Trust's AlphaDEX suite employs screening techniques based on growth and value metrics. That could give FXD a leg up on its rivals, particularly if risk on returns in earnest. Actually, FXD is already starting to outpace some of its rivals. Over the past 90 days, FXD is up 8.5 percent compared to 6.2 percent for the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY).

2012-11-01,Chinese Manufacturing Rebounds in October,"New data released overnight suggests that China's manufacturing sector may have bottomed over the last few months. Both the official Manufacturing PMI and the privately surveyed HSBC Markit China PMI showed a rebound in China's largest economic sector, boding well for China domestically and for the global economy as a whole. The official Chinese Manufacturing PMI released by the government showed that the manufacturing sector expanded in October. The survey of the largest Chinese manufacturers showed that China's manufacturing sector expanded for the first time in three months in October, as the PMI rose to 50.2 from 49.8 in September. The PMI came in lower than expected (economists were looking for 50.3), but the fact that the manufacturing sector expanded was enough to send Chinese shares higher by over 1.5 percent overnight. Also, the private HSBC Markit China PMI showed a rebound in the manufacturing sector. The survey rose to 49.5 from 49.1 in September and beat expectations of a flat reading at 49.1. This survey, which contains a greater number of Chinese manufacturers that tend to be smaller than the ones surveyed by the government, showed continued contraction in the sector, albeit at a much slower pace. China's economy has been slowing as its two largest trading partners' economies have stagnated. The Eurozone, China's largest trading partner, has been stuck in a recession for most of 2012 following sharp austerity measures aimed at reducing debt loads. Meanwhile, the U.S. economy has shown signs of slowing, weighing on Chinese manufacturing, as many of the manufactured goods are in turn exported to the U.S. In New York, material stocks rallied at the open on the positive news. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) rose 0.78 percent just after the open as higher growth and output in China may lead to higher demand for raw materials -- China is a large importer of these materials. Shares of Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) rallied strongly on the news, rallying 1.8 percent. Overall, the data suggests that China has (or is in the process of) bottoming and could see a rebound in growth through the end of 2012 and into 2013. Fiscal measures in the U.S. contained in the fiscal cliff could hurt Chinese exports, but rumors of a Chinese fiscal stimulus in 2013 still abound and could lead to a further pop in the economy. Historically, China has launched stimuli during the fall months, however, economists believe that, due to the regime change set to take place at the end of the year, authorities will wait until the change of power has concluded."
2012-11-06,"Royal Bank of Australia Keeps Rates on Hold, Surprises Market","The Royal Bank of Australia (RBA) overnight released its November interest rate decision and unexpectedly kept rates on hold. The RBA kept the benchmark cash lending rate at 3.25 percent in November, defying economist expectations of a 0.25 percent cut to 3.00 percent. The holding of rates follows October's decision where the Bank unexpectedly cut rates by 25 basis points. In fact, only one economist of the 27 surveyed by Bloomberg has predicted the previous two decisions accurately. The economists at ANZ bank predicted that the RBA would cut rates in October and keep them on hold in November. The RBA cited recent upticks in inflation and better signs out of China as reasons for keeping rates on hold. The RBA was slightly concerned with recent inflation data coming in higher than expected, a key reason for keeping rates on hold, but also noted that wage growth remains low. Generally, inflation can not take off unless wages, which are regarded as sticky by economists, start to inflate. Thus, the lack of wage growth could mean that the spurt in inflation is transitory and not fundamental. The Bank also noted that China appears to be bottoming along with the rest of the economy. In its post-decision communique, the Bank said that Chinese growth has stabilized. The RBA has a unique view of the Chinese economy both due to its geographic proximity but also because of the trade ties between Australia and China through raw materials. Thus, these comments should not be taken lightly and could confirm recent data trends that China is bottoming or has in fact already bottomed. Officials were concerned about the strength of the domestic currency and of commodity prices though. The RBA members warned in the communique that the Aussie dollar remains strong, one reason that exports have stayed lower than anticipated. Also, the bank is worried about commodity prices being lower than they were this year, as a large portion of Australia's economy is reliant on strong exports of raw materials. An interesting fact to note about the lack of a rate cut is that, although economists were expecting a cut, the market was decidedly in disagreement with the economists. Using interest swaps to extrapolate the chances of a cut just before the release of the statement, the market had only priced in approximately a 45 percent chance of a cut in rates. Therefore, either traders knew something that economists did not know or that the Aussie swap traders were simply just smarter than their forecasting cousins. The Aussie dollar rallied markedly on the news and the Australian stock market outperformed other Asian bourses. The Aussie dollar popped from near 1.0360 to near 1.0420 against the U.S. dollar on the release and has traded higher since. Currently, the pair trades at 1.0433, just below resistance and stops at 1.0450. Also, the EUR/AUD cross dropped to the lowest level since early September on the release as Aussie strength weighed on the euro. The Aussie also gained against the Japanese yen as investors piled into the carry trade, getting the higher than expected yield in the Aussie as a rate cut would have meant lower interest on deposited currency. Australian stocks also showed relative outperformance in Asian trading. The S&P ASX Index rose 0.24 percent overnight while other regional indexes suffered losses on global growth and European fears. For comparison, Chinese stocks fell 0.38 percent overnight and Japanese shares also fell 0.36 percent. Materials stocks rose slightly in U.S. trading at the open on the largely positive comments from the RBA. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) rose 0.17 percent and notable out-performers included Rio Tinto PLC (NYSE: RIO) and BHP Billiton PLC (NYSE: BBL), which each rallied nearly 1.0 percent at the New York open. Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold (NYSE: FCX) also rallied, but not as strongly as its British competitors."
2012-11-08,These QE3 ETF Plays Have Proven Durable,"On September 13, the Federal Reserve announced it would engage in additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities while pledging to keep interest rates low through at least mid-2015. That amounted to the third round of quantitative easing so many traders and investors were dying to hear about and a market rally was ignited in the process. Now, nearly two months since the Fed unveiled QE3, many of the most obvious ETF beneficiaries of the program have given up their gains. ETFs ranging from equity-based energy funds to those tracking mortgage agencies have tumbled, leading investors to wonder if QE3 will have any positive impact at all. Not all is lost as the following QE3 ETF plays have held up quite nicely following the announcement. Perhaps that is a sign of more gains to come. iShares MSCI All Peru Capped Index Fund (NYSE: EPU) The lone ETF exclusively devoted to Peru was anointed an ideal QE3 play because Peru is a major producer of gold and silver. Monetary easing debases currencies, in this case the dollar, and gold is denominated in dollars. The prediction about EPU being a valid QE3 ETF proved accurate as the fund rallied in the days leading up to September 13 and on the announcement itself. EPU would take a peak over $45 following the QE3 news and while it is slightly below that level today, the fund has held onto the bulk of its QE3-induced gains. Now, EPU looks like a credible play with which to avoid the post-election fallout in the U.S.. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY) One of the desired intents of quantitative easing is to spur economic activity and to get consumers feeling good about the economy. That means XLY and other discretionary ETFs were bid up leading up to and following the announcement. To be fair, XLY is trading lower today than where it was on September 13. However, the fund has held up better than other obvious QE3 sector plays such as oil ETFs and XLY has found support at $46. Risk takers can buy XLY at current levels and reap the rewards of a potentially robust holiday shopping season. Averting the fiscal cliff will also be a positive catalyst for XLY and its rivals. Global X Silver Miners ETF (NYSE: SIL) Any of the equity-based mining ETFs would have been included on a list of QE3 winners and SIL is no exception. With a beta over 2.2, market-moving monetary stimulus is like a dream come true for an ETF such as this one. The downside of SIL's high beta ways is that the fund is highly volatile and vulnerable to waning enthusiasm for programs such as QE3. Well, it should be noted SIL trades slightly lower today than where it resided immediately following the Fed's September 13 announcement. However, there is more to the story. Not only is SIL still within striking distance of its post-announcement highs, since September 13 the ETF has sharply outperformed the following QE3 winners: The Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX), the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP).

2012-11-15,"Soros Adds to Gold Miner ETF Positions, Raises GLD Stake","Billionaire investor George Soros, who as recently as late 2011 said gold was an asset bubble, now appears quite bullish on the yellow metal and the companies that extract it from the earth. During the third quarter, Soros Fund Management LLC added to its investment in the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD), the second-largest ETF in the world by assets. The firm raised its interest in GLD to 1.3 million shares from 884,400 shares, according to an SEC filing. Even at 1.3 million shares. Soros Fund Management owns a small percentage of GLD's shares outstanding, which stood at 443.2 million as of November 14. The filing also indicates Soros Fund Management has boosted its holdings of ETFs that own shares of gold miners. An August SEC filing showed the firm held 1 million shares of the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and nearly 2.4 million shares of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). The November filing indicates Soros has more than doubled his GDX stake to 2.32 million shares and now holds a sizable chunk of call options on the ETF as well. The firm's position in GDXJ has not changed, according to the filing. Since mid-August, GLD has jumped 6.6 percent while GDXJ has soared 5.7 percent. GDX has risen 3.3 percent over the same time. Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) combine for a third of GDX's weight. Soros also slightly added to his position in the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). The firm owned 350,000 shares of XME as of the August filing, but the more recent November filing indicates that stake has risen to 353,400 shares and the firm also owns call options on that ETF. XME does hold some gold miners, but the fund is heavily allocated to coal and steel names such as Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE). Soros also holds a stake in the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) as well as call options on that position. Other ETFs that Soros Fund Management holds interests in according to the November filing include the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP), the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE: KBE) and the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). The firm also owns options on the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund (NYSE: EEM) and the iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund (NYSE: FXI). EEM is the second-largest emerging markets ETF by assets while FXI is the largest China fund. For more on ETFs, click here."
2012-12-03,How To Find the Best Sector ETFs,"Finding the best ETFs is an increasingly difficult task in a world where a new ETF seems to be born every 10 seconds. You Cannot Trust ETF Labels There are at least 45 different financial sector ETFs. There are at least 176 ETFs across all sectors. Do investors need 45 different financial sector ETFs or 176 ETFs for 10 sectors? How different can they be? Those 45 financial sector ETFs are very different. With anywhere from 23 to 519 holdings, many of these ETFs have drastically different holdings, which creates drastically different investment implications. I am sure that most of them hold the big names in the sector such as Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM). However, investors need to know what else those ETFs hold before they can gain a fair understanding of the ETF. The same is true for the ETFs in any sector as each sector offers a very different mix of good and bad stocks. Some sectors have lots of good stocks and offer lots of good ETFs. The opposite is true for some sectors. And some sectors lie somewhere in between with a fair mix of good and bad stocks. For example, the financial sector, per my 4Q Sector Ratings report, ranks last out of the 10 major sectors when it comes to providing investors with quality ETF. The consumer staples sector ranks first. The energy and materials sectors are in the middle. Details on the Best & Worst ETFs in each sector are here. The bottom line is that investors simply cannot trust the ETF labels. You simply do not know what you are getting when you buy any particular sector ETF, based on name/label alone. Paralysis By Analysis I firmly believe ETFs for a given sector should not all be that different. I think the large number of financial (or any other) sector ETFs hurts investors more than it helps because too many options can be paralyzing. It is simply not possible for the majority of investors to properly assess the quality of so many ETFs. Analyzing ETFs, done with the proper diligence, is far more difficult than analyzing stocks because it means analyzing all the stocks within each ETF. As stated above, that can be as many as 519 stocks for one ETF. Nevertheless, any investor, worth his salt, knows that knowing the holdings of an ETF is critical to finding the best ETF. The Danger Within Why do investors need to know the holdings of ETFs before they buy? They need to know to be sure they do not buy an ETF that might blow up. Buying an ETF without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances. As Barron’s says, investors should know the Danger Within. Put another way, research on ETF holdings is necessary due diligence because an ETF’s performance is only as good as its holdings’ performance. No matter how cheap, if it holds bad stocks, the ETF’s performance will be bad. PERFORMANCE OF ETF’s HOLDINGs = PERFORMANCE OF ETF Finding the Sector ETFs with the Best Holdings Figure 1 shows my top rated ETF for each sector. Importantly, my ratings on ETFs are based primarily on my stock ratings of their holdings. My firm covers over 3000 stocks and is known for the due diligence we do for each stock we cover. Accordingly, our coverage of ETFs leverages the diligence we do on each stock by rating ETFs based on the aggregated ratings of the stocks each ETF holds. Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV) is not only the top-rated health care sector ETF, it is the overall top-rated ETF of the 176 sector ETFs I cover. Most of the top-rated ETFs for a given sector are not very good. For example, Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) is the top-rated energy sector ETF and it only gets three out of five stars. Same is true for Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU). Worse yet are the ETFs that rank as the best for their sector but have very little in assets. For example, First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (NYSE: TDIV) is the best tech sector ETF but it only has $45 million in assets. I recommend investor only buy ETFs with more than $100 million in assets. In which case, the next best tech sector ETF is Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK). Fortunately, it gets 4 stars like TDIV. You can find more liquid alternatives for the other funds on my free ETF screener. Figure 1: Best Sector ETFs Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings Covering All The Bases, Including Costs My ETF rating also takes into account the total annual costs, which represents the all-in cost of being in the ETF. This analysis is simpler for ETFs than funds because they do not charge front- or back-end loads and transaction costs are incurred directly. There is only the expense ratio, which is normally quite low. However, my ratings penalize those ETFs with abnormally high expense ratios or any other hidden costs. Top Stocks Make Up Top ETFs Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is one of favorite holdings in XLV, one of two ETFs in Figure 1 to get my 5-star rating. This stock gets my Very Attractive rating. JNJ has a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 17%, which places it in the top quintile of all companies. Usually that kind of profitability comes at a price. In this case, the valuation of JNJ’s stock price implies the company’s profits will permanently decline by over 25%. XLV’s large allocation to a highly profitable, yet undervalued stock, exemplifies why XLV is one of the few ETFs that gets a Very Attractive rating or 5 star rating. One of my favorite holdings in XLP, one of two ETFs in Figure 1 to get my 5-star rating, is Altria Group (NYSE: MO). Like JNJ, MO has a top-quintile ROIC of 15% and has an excellent history of economic earnings growth. In fact, in its last fiscal year, MO’s economic earnings per share grew over 9% while the diluted GAAP EPS fell over 13%. Consequently, I think most investors are underestimating the profitability of this company, which is why its stock valuation is unduly depressed. The current valuation of the stock (~$34/share) implies the company’s profits (i.e. NOPAT) will permanently decline by nearly 15%. That is a big discount for such profitable business. High profit growth and low valuation create excellent risk/reward in a stock. Disclosure: I own JNJ. I receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector or theme."
2013-01-02,"Risk on Today, Says WallachBeth","U.S. equities and other riskier assets are in rally mode in the first trading session of 2013 after lawmakers finally got around to agreeing on legislation that steered the U.S. away from the dreaded fiscal cliff. News that a deal was in the works ignited a rally on Monday while news that the cliff will be dodged has done the same today as the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 230 points at this writing while the Nasdaq Composite is sitting on a gain of 2.3 percent. The tenor of Wednesday's U.S. trading session is clearly risk on, so much so that before 10:30 AM Eastern time, the overall value of equities and ETFs traded was $73 billion, according to data provided by ETF execution firm WallachBeth. New York-based WallachBeth noted that only trading day in all of 2012 – December options expiration – saw equity value traded exceed $70 billion in the first hour of trading. In a note to clients, WallachBeth Director of ETF Execution Services Chris Hempstead highlighted intense buying activity on the ask in several marquee broad market ETFs. Buying on the ask could be described as panic buying to some extent as traders that are willing to buy on the ask price being shown are indicating they are willing to pay up to acquire shares of a particular stock or ETF. The more times the ask price is hit, the more intense a rally becomes. Hempstead said WallachBeth has seen intense ask buying in the PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ), commonly referred to as the Nasdaq 100 tracking ETF, today. Other popular broad market ETFs where WallachBeth has seen unusual buying activity include the $38.8 billion iShares MSCI EAFE Index Fund (NYSE: EFA) and the $3.2 billion iShares MSCI ACWI Index Fund (NASDAQ: ACWI). Despite Wednesday's grab for riskier assets, the U.S. government still has issues to tackle, including the debt ceiling in a few short weeks. With the deal made in Washington leaving most economists scratching their heads we would cautiously assume that this unusual volume and skew is not necessarily here for the long run, said Hempstead in the note. A drop in volume and liquidity as we approach the next big near term media buzzword ‘debt ceiling' would not come as a surprise. Even with the debt ceiling issue inching its way into the headlines before the fiscal cliff was solved, traders are still content to embrace high-beta sectors today. WallachBeth, which provides ETF execution services to clients such as Registered Investment Advisors and trading desks, said ask buying has been intense in sector funds such as the Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). Buyers have also stepped into the Vanguard MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSE: VWO), the largest emerging markets ETF by assets, in a meaningful way, according to WallachBeth. Up almost two percent on the day, the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (NYSE: VTI) has seen a noticeable uptick in volume while the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE: XHB), one of 2012's top sector funds, has seen buyers take the ask to the tune of a 2.6 percent gain, according to WallachBeth data. Even with all that ebullience, a cautious approach may be best over the near-term in Hempstead's eyes. ...2013 headlines and market sensitivity should get right back on the spinning ‘wheel of media buzzwords' bandwagon with the top flash cards being: Debt Ceiling and US credit rating – European Sovereign Debt – civil unrest in the Middle East--The Iran and Israel relationship – North Korea – Japan's woes – extreme drought – extreme flooding – and of course China growth.

2013-01-04,S&P Lukewarm on Some Materials ETFs,"Despite signs of slowing growth in some emerging markets, there are also signs the U.S. economy is rebounding and China has delivered plenty of signals in recent weeks that is experiencing a turnaround of its own. That could be just one of the catalysts to lift materials ETFs in 2013, though S&P Capital IQ has a Neutral view of the sector. We foresee monthly PMI data for each of the major economies, including China, continuing to show improvement as the year progresses. In addition, EPS growth in the fourth quarter of 2012 for this S&P 500 sector is expected by Capital IQ consensus estimates to be 3.9% and exceed that for the S&P 500. In 2013, earnings are expected to be similarly strong. Finally, our technical outlook has been raised to neutral with a bullish bias, from neutral with a bearish bias, S&P Capital IQ said in a recent research note. The research firm is somewhat bullish on diversified chemicals firms, which could favor an ETF such as the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYM). Fundamentals for diversified chemicals, the largest sub-industry in the sector, are positive, according the S&P Capital IQ equity analysts. We think the decline in U.S. natural gas prices relative to global crude oil prices has improved the feedstock cost competitiveness of the U.S. petrochemical industry versus other global regions, such as Europe, thus helping boost U.S. industry exports, said S&P Capital IQ. IYM, which is home $543.4 million in assets under management, features Dow component DuPont (NYSE: DD), Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW), Air Products & Chemicals (NYSE: APD) and other chemicals names among its top-10 lineup. S&P rates IYM as Marketweight. The ETF has an annual expense ratio of 0.47 percent. S&P Capital IQ also has a Market-weight rating on the Vanguard Chemicals ETF (NYSE: VAW). Due to a recent fee reduction announced by Vanguard, VAW now has the lowest expense ratio of any materials ETF at 0.14 percent per year. VAW allocates 19.3 percent of its weight to diversified chemicals names, though its largest holding is crop nutrients maker Monsanto (NYSE: MON). S&P is also bullish on diversified metals and mining names. The firm said its equity analysts have a positive fundamental outlook for the next 12 months, as we believe sales and earnings will recover from 2012's depressed levels. Our expectation reflects our view that prices for aluminum, copper, nickel, zinc, iron ore and coking coal will rebound from 2012's levels on higher demand and less rapidly rising output. The research firm has a Market-weight rating on the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). That $2.55 billion ETF is includes mining names such as Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) and Newmont Mining (NYSE: NEM) along with Monsanto and DuPoint among its top holdings. S&P is less enthused about the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSE: XME), which it rates Underweight. With steel stocks such as U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) accounting for over 36 percent of XME's weight, the ETF carries a high beta of 1.67 and is highly dependent on a strong economies in the developed and emerging worlds to drive its returns. Investors should also note XME has an almost 15 percent to beaten down coal and consumable fuels names. For more on materials ETFs, click here."
2013-01-06,Alcoa Earnings Preview: Lower Fourth-Quarter Revenue Expected,"Alcoa (NYSE: AA), shares of which have surged about eight percent in the past week, is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter 2012 results Tuesday, January 8, after the markets close. Investors will be looking to see how much the sluggish global economy, particularly in China and in Europe, will drag on earnings. Moody's recently warned that it might downgrade Alcoa, in part due to its debt load. Expectations Analysts on average predict that Alcoa will report revenue for the quarter that fell more than six percent year-over-year to $5.61 billion. Per-share earnings are expected to come to $0.06, compared to a net loss of $0.03 per share in the same quarter of last year. That consensus earnings estimate has slipped in the past 60 days from $0.08 per share. Alcoa has not fallen short of earnings expectations in the past four quarters. The third quarter adjusted profit of $0.03 surprised analysts, who had expected Alcoa to break even. Alcoa attributed the third quarter results to stronger demand for aluminum products from airplane and automobile producers. But it also posted charges for settlements with the Environmental Protection Agency and a joint venture partner in Bahrain, and it lowered its aluminum demand expectations for the fourth quarter, largely due to China's economic slowdown. The share price pulled back almost five percent in the week following the third-quarter report. The analysts' consensus full-year forecast calls $0.24 per share earnings on revenue of $23.36 billion. That compares to $0.72 per share and $24.95 billion in the previous year. That consensus EPS estimate has declined in the past 60 days from $0.26. The Company Alcoa is the world's third largest producer of aluminum. The company operates in four segments: Alumina, Primary Metals, Flat-Rolled Products, and Engineered Products and Solutions. This S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average component has a market capitalization near $9.9 billion and its operational headquarters are in Pittsburgh. Klaus Kleinfeld has been the chief executive since May 2008. Alcoa's two larger competitors are privately held Rio Tinto Alcan and RUSAL. It also competes with Aluminum Corporation of China (NYSE: ACH). The latter is expected to report net losses for the fourth quarter and the full year. During the three months that ended in December, Alcoa sent its first shipment of alumina to a new joint venture-run facility in Saudi Arabia, completed the sale of a hydroelectric project located in Tennessee and opened an aluminum wheel facility in China. Performance Alcoa's long-term EPS growth forecast is more than 10 percent, and the forward earnings multiple is less than the industry average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. The operating margin is greater than the industry average, but the return on equity is in negative territory. The number of shares sold short is more than six percent of the float, the highest it has been since the end of October. Only six of the 19 analysts surveyed by Thomson/First Call who follow the stock recommend buying shares; 10 of them recommend holding shares. However, the analysts believe the stock has some room to run as their mean price target represents almost 11 percent potential upside. But that target price is less than the 52-week high from early last year. Shares flirted with the 52-week low in mid-November, but they have risen about 15 percent since then. As previously mentioned, the share price jumped about eight percent in the past week. It crossed above the 200-day moving average for the first time since September. Over the past six months, the stock has underperformed Aluminum Corp. of China, but its performance has been in line with the DJIA. ACTION ITEMS Bullish: Investors interested in exchange traded funds invested in Alcoa might want to consider the following trades: iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials (NYSE: IYM) is almost nine percent higher than a month ago. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is about eight percent higher than a month ago. Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW) is about seven percent higher than a month ago. Bearish: Traders may prefer to consider these alternative positions in the same sector: Alpha Natural Resources (NYSE: ANR) is up more than 29 percent in the past month. Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF) is up more than 28 percent in the past month. Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (NYSE: SID) is up more than 20 percent in the past month. Vale (NYSE: VALE) is up almost 18 percent in the past month."

2013-03-06,3 Sector ETFs Outpacing Larger Rivals,"Sectors lead the broader market, not the other way around. With U.S. stocks flirting with all-time highs, it is a good idea to identify leaders and laggards at the sector level. This exercise is also an excellent way for investors to take part in the ongoing debate about large ETFs and their often noticeable inability to outperform smaller equivalents. Using the nine State Street Global Advisors Select Sector SPDRs as the measuring tools, investors will see that in terms of year-to-date returns, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV) and the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) are the best year-to-date performers with gains of 11.3 and 10.7 percent, respectively, according to ETF Replay data. The SPDR laggards are the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the Technology Select Sector (NYSE: XLK) with returns of 3.4 and 4.6 percent, respectively. With those returns in mind, here are some of the sector ETFs that have been outperforming their SPDRs rivals in 2013. First Trust Energy AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXN) In addition to health care and staples, energy has shown strong sector leadership to start 2013. Helped in large part by its 15 percent weight to Chevron (NYSE: CVX), which is up 9.6 percent year-to-date, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) has gained nearly 9.3 percent since the start of the year. Gaining 9.3 percent in just over two months is a return that most investors would not scoff at, but the First Trust Energy AlphaDEX Fund has done better. Try 100 basis points better. As is the case with the other AlphaDEX sector funds, is not a traditional market capitalization-weighted ETF. Rather, FXN holdings are selected based on growth factors such as price appreciation and value factors such as return on assets. The result is an energy fund that is not excessively weighted to Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) as XLE. In fact, Hess (NYSE: HES) is FXN's largest holding with a weight of less than four percent. Now the question is can FXN outperform XLE and related ETFs for the rest of the year? The answer is yes if refiners such as Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) and oil services names, a group that FXN is significantly more exposed to than XLE, continue soaring. Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (NYSE: RYT) The inclusion of the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF on this probably will not surprise those investors (practically everyone) that have heard about Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stunning fall from grace. To review, Apple's run to the stratosphere last year meant the stock started dominating cap-weighted technology sector ETFs. That was nice on the way up, but far from pleasant on the way down. Apple's dramatically declining market value has trimmed its weight in XLK to 13.7 percent. Still, that is nearly 600 basis points higher than Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG) weight within the fund. Long story short, XLK is up just 4.6 percent this year, telling some investors that perhaps tech is being left behind in this rally. Not really, RYT is almost 9.8 percent. The difference? Apple is RYT's second-smallest holding with an allocation of just 1.09 percent. First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXH) As was noted earlier, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR has been a stellar performer this year and it is unlikely most investors would quibble about earning 11.3 percent in just over two months. For the moment, it is hard to criticize XLV beyond the fact that three stocks -– Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Merck (NYSE: MRK) –- combine for about a third of the ETF's weight. The First Trust Health Care AlphaDEX Fund takes a much different approach to this sector. Pharmaceuticals names account for just 9.4 percent of FXH's weight, but health care provides and equipment makers combine for 61 percent. Top holdings include Tenet Healthcare (NYSE: THC), DaVita (NYSE: DVA) and WellPoint (NYSE: WLP). Two knocks on FXH: Its expense ratio of 0.7 percent is far higher than XLV's and some other health care ETFs. Second, FXH's three-year standard deviation is about 250 basis points higher than the S&P 500 Health Care Index, according to First Trust data. In favor FXH, it has a higher Sharpe ratio than the aforementioned index and has outperformed XLV this year, over the past year and over the past five years. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-03-19,These Leveraged ETFs Could be Worth The Risk ,"Leveraged ETFs, whether they be the double- or triple-leveraged, bullish, or bearish funds, are risky instruments that are best used as short-term trading vehicles. That much is widely known. Put the term leveraged ETF criticism into Google and sit back as almost 68,000 results are returned in three tenths of a second. These ETFs have been criticized to levels that no longer add value. In fact some critics are so misinformed that they have implied the recently announced closure of two leveraged ETFs by one particular issuer is a sign of things to come. Here is the reality: Leveraged ETFs are not for everyone. Issuer web sites say as much and anyone opting to ignore the abundant warnings surrounding this ETF sub-segment is likely headed for heartache. Reality part two: Proper use of leveraged ETFs can result in quick profits for agile traders and the following funds could be worth the risk if global macro headwinds persist. ProShares UltraShort MSCI Brazil (NYSE: BZQ) The ProShares UltraShort MSCI Brazil is the double-leveraged equivalent of the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ). EWZ may be the largest Brazil ETF on the market, but it is also a fund that has a hard time staying out of its own way. Earlier this month, EWZ perked up after finally getting some help from downtrodden Petrobras (NYSE: PBR). Well, in further proof that if it is not one thing it is another for EWZ, Vale (NYSE: VALE) is a real thorn in EWZ's side. Vale, the world's largest iron ore producer, accounts for almost 10 percent of EWZ's weight. That is not a good thing when shares of Vale are off almost 12.5 percent in the past month and are getting toasted on lingering concerns about the Chinese economy. On a technical basis, EWZ has been rebuffed around $57.50 several times this year and could be vulnerable on a close below $55. Conversely, BZQ is starting to creep above resistance at $65. A new breakout for the bearish play could follow. Direxion Daily Russia Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: RUSS) The Direxion Daily Russia Bear 3X Shares represents a particularly risky trade and not just because this is triple-leveraged play. For starters, RUSS has surged almost 16 percent in the past five days as long Russia ETFs have tumble on the back of the Cyprus headlines. That gain could imply RUSS is overbought here. Second, further declines in Russian equities enhance the case that these stocks are attractively valued. If buyers take the valuation bait, RUSS could tumble just as rapidly as it has climbed. Living in the here and now, RUSS does hold some promise for active traders if Cyprus remains a problem. The key is realizing a 10 percent gain in two day or 16 percent in five days is impressive, taking profits from there and not being too greedy. ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN) Even with a year-to-date gain of over five percent, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is proving to be a laggard among the nine sector SPDRs ETFs. That said, traders should note the ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials does not track the same index as XLB. Rather, SMN seeks to deliver twice the daily inverse returns of the index tracked by the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYM). While global materials names such as BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) and Vale have recently been worse performers than many of IYM's holdings, some of the ETF's marquee constituents are starting to show signs of weakness. In the past week, DuPont (NYSE: DD) and Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) are each down more than 0.7 percent while Freeport McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) is off more than two percent. Those three stocks combine for over 24 percent of IYM's weight. Losses for IYM could really accelerate if the ETF violates support at $69 while SMN becomes all the more alluring as a quick-strike trade above $52. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-03-25,Discretionary ETF: Best SPDR For 3 Years,"Since March 22, 2010, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) has returned 42 percent, including dividends paid. An impressive performance to be sure, but it is often said, and it is true, that sectors lead the broader market not the other way around. On a related note, a frequently discussed topic in recent months has been what sectors are displaying leadership qualities. With consumer staples ranking high on that list, some investors, professional and retail, have doubted the viability of the broader market rally. Interestingly, a case can be made that this has been a risk off rally for three years now. Using the nine Select Sector SPDRs as the barometers while going back to March 22, 2010, only one so-called risky ETF has offered noteworthy out-performance of those sector funds that are perceived to have less risk. That ETF is the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY). The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR has returned 68.6 percent since March 22, 2010, meaning the ETF has been simply dominant over other sector funds such as the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK). XLY has easily trumped XLF and XLB over the past 24 months as well. Over that time, XLY has offered better than six times the returns of XLB and almost double the returns of XLK. Remember, XLK had the benefit of having Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) among its top holdings as that stock surged to astronomical heights. Not High Beta What may come as a surprise to some investors is that XLY is not extremely volatile despite being home to stocks that are believed to be intimate plays on consumer confidence and sentiment such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Home Depot (NYSE: HD) and Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS). The ETF has a beta of one against the S&P 500 and annualized volatility of 16.88 percent, according to State Street data. That is a slightly lower beta than what is seen on XLK. Over the past three years, XLY has been about 500 basis points less volatile than XLB and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE), according to ETF Replay data. XLE and XLB currently have betas against the S&P 500 of 1.28 and 1.22, respectively. Not The Only One With $4.44 billion in assets under management, XLY is the largest discretionary ETF by that metric. It is home to plenty of familiar names and heavily traded with average daily volume of almost 5.5 million shares over the past three months. However, XLY is not the only generator of noteworthy discretionary ETF returns over the past several years. With a three-year return of 67.6 percent, the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (NYSE: VCR) stacks up favorably against the other non-discretionary sector ETFs mentioned here as well as Vanguard's own lineup of sector funds. While VCR and XLY are comparable on many levels, cost-conscious investors should keep an eye on this tussle in the coming months because a recent fee reduction by Vanguard means VCR is four basis points cheaper than XLY. That works out to 0.14 percent per year for VCR and 0.18 percent for XLY. Investors that are willing to embrace some added risk can consider the First Trust Consumer Discretionary AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXD). Although FXD has lagged VCR and XLY over the past three years, but the First Trust offering has significantly outpaced other sector funds as well over that time, including energy, materials and technology. FXD is not a market cap-weighted ETF. Rather, it uses growth and value metrics to parse through possible constituents. The result is an ETF that looks far different than VCR or XLY in terms of holdings. FXD holds 125 stocks with the top holding being Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) at a weight of just 2.45 percent. Other top-10 holdings include Starz (NASDAQ: STRZA) and Virgin Media (NASDAQ: VMED). FXD has been a decent performer over the past year with a gain of 12.2 percent, but some lower risk sector funds such as the Consumer Staples Select SPDR (NYSE: XLP) have delivered better gains. FXD has a three-year standard deviation of 20.4 percent compared to 17.1 percent for the S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index, according to First Trust data. That could be viewed as a sign that FXD is better suited to an environment that is more risk on friendly, but it is worth noting FXD has outpaced VCR and XLY year-to-date.

2013-03-26,Risk On Rally? These ETFs Say No,"It seems like whenever the rally in the S&P 500 is discussed, at least when it is talked about in positive terms, it is associated with favorite Wall Street vernacular such as risk on and animal spirits. With the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) up almost 41 percent in the past three years, including dividends paid, it is not illogical to think risk on has ruled the roost over that time. A closer examination of sector ETFs paints a different picture. As was highlighted on Monday, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY) has been the standout of the nine sector SPDRs funds over the past three years. Thing about XLY is the ETF has a beta of one against the S&P 500 and annualized volatility of 16.88 percent. Said another way, XLY is not the most volatile, nor is it the riskiest ETF out there. Simply put, this has been a risk off rally and it has been that way for three years. Returns accrued by sector ETFs prove as much. High Beta Disappoints...Sort Of Here is a trivia question: Excluding XLY, which is the only sector SPDR that is perceived as a high-beta play to outpace SPY over the past three years? Answer: The Energy Select Sector (NYSE: XLE). XLE has topped SPY by 350 basis points over that time while being 660 basis points more volatile. The 23.1 percent gain for the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) only look good in comparison to the 19.4 percent gain for the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF). Those ETFs have betas of 1.22 and 1.23, respectively, against the S&P 500. Then there is the case of the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK), an ETF perhaps best known for having one of the largest weights to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). XLK has a beta of 1.08 and annualized volatility of 16.16 percent, according to State Street data. Alright, so those number do not make XLK the most volatile ETF out there and it is up 36.1 percent in the past three years. However, the SPDR options that have outperformed XLK, and XLB, XLE and XLF for that matter, might surprise those that are convinced this has been a risk on rally. Low Beta Dominates Furthering the notion that investors have preferred sectors they perceive as less risky are the returns to the relevant SPDR ETFs over the past three years. Since March 23, 2010, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) has surged 52.3 percent. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) is up 46 percent while the Utilities Select Sector SPDR is up 44.1 percent. Here is an interesting and accurate way of looking at this rally: XLU has outperformed XLK by 800 basis points over the past three years while being 550 basis points less volatile. Moreover, investors have been paying up for the privilege of getting their hands on XLP's 0.63 and XLU's 0.47 betas. Both ETFs, XLU in particular, are richly valued on a historical basis. Those that prefer riskier fare might be apt to say Three years is a long time. Maybe the higher beta sectors have outperformed over narrower time horizons. Well, over the past two years, SPY is up 25.1 percent. Of the four riskier sector SPDRs highlighted here, only XLK is reasonably close to that performance with a gain of 23.1 percent. XLU tops SPY's two-year run by nearly 700 basis points. Owning just XLP and XLV would have worked out even better. The average two-year returns to those ETFs is nearly 43.3 percent. Said another way, two ETFs that hold stocks such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Merck (NYSE: MRK) have, when averaged together, nearly doubled the performance of XLK. XLK is home to Apple, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and sexier fare than P&G and Pfizer. Things have not gotten any better for the risk on crowd in the past 12 months. Over that time, only XLF of the high beta ETFs highlighted here, has posted a double-digit gain. XLF has delivered returns of < href=http://www.etfreplay.com/charts.aspx>16.8 percent with 16.6 percent volatility. XLV, home to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Pfizer and Merck, has outperformed XLF in the past 12 months by 800 basis points while being 550 basis points less volatile. Surely, Apple and Google sound more exciting than P&G and PepsiCo, right? Well, there is little exciting about XLK's 1.9 percent return over the past year. The 20.3 percent offered by the far less volatile XLP is far more attractive. Over the past six months, only XLF has topped XLP, XLU and XLV, but over the past 90 days XLF only tops XLU while lagging XLP and XLV. Risk on rally? Yeah, right. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-04-01,Materials Mess: These ETFs Are in Trouble,"These are not the best of times for materials stocks and the corresponding ETFs. In the first quarter, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) gained 4.8 percent. While that does not sound terrible, it is less than half the 10.5 percent returned by the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY). XLB's performance also makes it the worst of the nine sector SPDRs. In fact, seven of the nine sector SPDRs offered double-digit first-quarter returns with only the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) joining XLB in the single-digit club. Still, XLK's 5.4 percent first-quarter gain is far better than XLB's performance. Unfortunately for materials bulls, XLB looks like one of the better ETFs tracking this sector. Year-to-date, Monsanto (NYSE: MON) an DuPont (NYSE: DD) are up 9.86 percent and 7.17 percent, respectively. Those stocks combine for over 21 percent of XLB's weight. XLB has also been helped by the fact metals miners account for just 17 percent of the ETF's weight. Other materials ETFs have not been so fortunate and several now look imperiled. Take the case of the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME). The $609.3 million XME plunged 10.3 percent in the first quarter and that was before Monday's two percent loss (as of 1:30 PM Eastern time). XME has an ominous sub-sector mix. Alone, gold miners account for 10.4 percent of the fund's weight and as if that is not bad enough, other metals miners account for another 11.6 percent while coal and consumable fuels names represent 17.3 percent, according to State Street data. Making matters worse is the fact that last week XME made a death cross, the technical scenario where a shorter term moving average crosses below a longer term average. In the case of XME, its 50-day moving average is now slightly below its 200-day line. Speaking of coal stocks, 2013 is proving to be another tough year for that group. Add in Monday's almost 1.6 percent slide and the Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL) is now off 10.2 percent year-to-date. KOL has not made a death cross yet, but the chart indicates it may just be a matter of time. In another bad sign for KOL, at least four of its top-10 holdings – Joy Global (NYSE: JOY), Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU), Yanzhou Coal (NYSE: YZC) and Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT) – reside below their 200-day moving averages. Those stocks combine for over 21 percent of KOL's weight. If KOL violates support at $22.50, a return to $20 seems likely. Things are not much better for global materials names. The iShares S&P Global Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: MXI) is now down 5.7 percent this year when accounting for Monday's 0.9 percent loss. A 44 percent weight to metals miners has proven problematic and MXI is now struggling to hold support at its 200-day line. Additionally, MXI allocates 14.5 percent of its weight to various securities issued by BHP Billiton (NYSE: BHP) and Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO). Australian central bankers and policymakers have already acknowledged mining investment there is declining and that the mining boom will peak later this year, implying upside could be limited for these stocks and related fare. Another cause for concern: More than a third of MXI's top-18 holdings have exposure to gold mining. That is not a good thing when the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down 18.4 percent this year. A possible solution for investors looking to profit the woes of the materials sector is the ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN). SMN seeks to deliver twice the daily inverse performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index. That is the index tracked by the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYM). If IYM breaks resistance at $52, a run to $55 could be in the offing.

2013-04-02,Further Confirmation Materials ETFs Are Imperiled,"With the S&P 500 up about 0.7 percent Tuesday and having touched a new record high, it is not hard to find the laggards among sector ETFs. There are a few funds tracking the oil and semiconductor sub-segments that are in the red, but those losses are not yet alarming. The real cause for concern remains the materials sector. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is down 0.54 percent today, and while that may not sound like much, remember that XLB was by far the worst performer of the nine sector SPDRs in the first quarter. XLB's first-quarter gain was not even half of what the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) returned. Tuesday may be just one day, but the problem for XLB and other materials ETFs is that this far from the worst day this year these funds have been laggards. As lower beta sectors such as consumer staples and health care have lead the broader market higher, materials names have under-performed perhaps foreshadowing imminent declines. XLB is not the only materials ETF offender, either. As Benzinga noted on Monday, the SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE: XME) is in serious technical trouble. That ETF is off another 1.5 percent today and has now lost more than 16.5 percent year-to-date. With gold futures being hammered, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ) are both off more than three percent. In further proof that traders hate gold mining stocks and reverse splits are a joke, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners 3X Bull Shares (NYSE: NUGT) is down nearly 11 percent today, the ETF's first trading day after undergoing a four-for-one reverse split. There is more bad news. The iShares Dow Jones US Basic Materials Index Fund (NYSE: IYM) is flirting with support in the $68.80 area. A break there probably takes the ETF back to $65-$66. If the Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW) cannot hold $87, it likely returns to $82. Another way of illustrating the dark clouds hanging over materials ETFs right now is this. Look at a heat map of inverse ETFs and exclude the ones that are trading on a post-split basis today. The noteworthy, legitimate gainer is the ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN), which is close to staging a breakout of its own. SMN is not the largest nor is it the most heavily traded inverse ETF out there. However, it is up nearly one percent on a day when the S&P 500 hit a new record high and that is not a good sign for long materials ETFs. For more on materials ETFs, click here."
2013-04-02,Staples ETFs Rally: Here's Why It Can Continue,"Considering that it is home to some of the sleepiest stocks on the market and that it is merely the fifth-largest sector weight in the S&P 500, the consumer staples group has sure been on the receiving end of a lot of attention. Perhaps part of the reason is that some folks are having a hard time digesting the notion of staples playing a leadership role as U.S. stocks ascend to record highs. Fair enough. After all, it is reasonable to assume that the rally would have fewer doubting Thomases if sectors such as materials and technology were doing the leading. More recently, questions over staples' viability as a leadership sector have turned into musings about a potential bubble. Again, it is a legitimate issue to mull with the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) and the Vanguard Consumer Staples (NYSE: VDC) both up more than 20 percent year-to-date. However, just because folks are pontificating about a staples bubble does not mean one materialize in the near-term. In fact, there are several reasons why the consumer staples rally can keep going. The Rally Has Already Proven Durable Meaning, the staples rally has already proven durable. In fact, rallying staples stocks is nothing new. Going back to March 2010, XLP has been the second-best performing sector SPDR. Only the Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR (NYSE: XLY) has been better than XLP. Since March 29, 2010, XLP has nearly tripled the returns of the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) and more than doubled the returns of the Materials Select SPDR (NYSE: XLB). One can make of that what one will, but the reality is staples as a leadership group is a concept that is at least three years old. Seen It Before In the 2004-2007 bull market, the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) gained 41.4 percent, returns that trailed XLP by 310 basis points. From January 2, 2004 through December 31, 2007, four sector SPDRs performed better than XLP: The Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE), the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI), the Utilities Select SPDR (NYSE: XLU) and the aforementioned XLB. Over that time, XLP offered nearly double the returns of the Healthcare Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV) and better than triple the returns of XLF. XLP also outpaced XLY. Regarding XLP's 2004-2007 performance, it is middle of the pack among the sector ETFs mentioned here. However, it was good enough to outpace some higher beta sector ETFs such as XLF. Throw in the impressive 2004-2007 run for XLU and the current environment is not the first time in recent memory investors have seen low beta sectors outperform SPY on the way up. Investors Love Low Beta Speaking of low beta, investors love the concept of reduced beta/minimum volatility. Year-to-date inflows to so called low vol ETFs prove that point. In the first quarter, minimum volatility exchange traded products raked in $4.1 billion in new assets, or an average of $1.4 billion per month. That is more than triple the average monthly inflow seen to these ETFs last year, according to iShares data. ETFs such as the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (NYSE: SPLV) and the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index Fund (NYSE: USMV) are, not surprisingly, heavy on staples, health care and utilities names. Whether it is through individual stocks or via low vol ETFs, investors are expressing plenty of affection towards low volatility sectors. Combined, SPLV and USMV have about $7 billion in assets. That is hardly enough to bandy about favorite Wall Street buzz phrases such as crowded traded or bubble. Commodities Costs Here's an anecdotal example that is worth noting: A box of Honey Nut Chex made by General Mills (NYSE: GIS) contains whole grain corn, cornmeal and sugar. Year-to-date, the Teucrium Corn Fund (NYSE: CORN) is down more than nine percent. The iPath DJ-UBS Sugar TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: SGG) is off more than 10 percent. Other constituents in XLP and VDC make products with corn, coffee, chocolate, sugar and wheat. Good news: The average year-to-date performance for the Teucrium Wheat Fund (NYSE: WEAT), the iPath DJ-UBS Cocoa TR Sub-Idx ETN (NYSE: NIB) and the iPath DJ-UBS Coffee TR Sub-Index ETN (NYSE: JO) is a loss of about nine percent.

2013-04-03,Big Problems For Steel ETF ,"Signs just keep on creeping up that the materials sector is in trouble and in today's episode of As Materials ETFs Tumble, the Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) is in the spotlight. On light volume, SLX is down 0.7 percent and while that may not sound like much, Wednesday's decline extends a woeful start to 2013 for SLX and the ETF is now flirting with a year-to-date loss of 18 percent. To put that performance into context, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), the worst-performing of the nine sector SPDRs in the first quarter, is still clinging to a year-to-date gain. SLX's problems are not hard to identify. Just start with the ETF's two largest holdings, Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) and Vale (NYSE: VALE). Those mining giants combine for over 26 percent of SLX's weight. Rio Tinto's U.S.-listed shares are off almost 24 percent year-to-date and things could get worse before they get better for the Australian mining giant. Not only are Australian exporters being crimped by a strong Australian dollar, but the central bank there expects the mining sector will peak later this year. The Reserve Bank of Australia has already noted that sectors beyond mining and materials must step up to help the world's 12th-largest economy. Then there is Brazil's Vale, the world's largest iron ore producer. Even with today's 2.4 percent pop, Vale's U.S. shares are off 20.5 percent this year. In the case of this stock, investors can debate what is worse: The company's status as the world's leading iron ore maker or the fact that Vale is a Brazilian firm. Brazil has given investors almost nothing to cheer about for over a year now and Vale is proving to be a drag on SLX and some other marquee ETFs as a result. Investors should not just pick on SLX's foreign holdings. In the past month, Nucor (NYSE: NUE) is off more than three percent. When accounting for the Wednesday plunges of more than three percent in both Allegheny Technologies (NYSE: ATI) and Timken (NYSE: TKR), those stocks are both in the red in the past month. Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD) is now about 3.7 percent over the same time. Those four stocks combine for 17.5 percent of the ETF's weight. The hits just keep on coming to SLX. Even before today, U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) was down 12 percent since early March. That stock is now flirting with levels not seen since March 2009. SLX also has the misfortune of being home to Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF), the shares of which have plunged more than 52 percent in the past 90 days. Cliffs and U.S. Steel combine for about 6.8 percent of SLX's weight. Thus far in this piece, approximately half of SLX's weight has been accounted for and none of the news is good. Since it an equity-based ETF is moved by its underlying holdings, it is not surprising to see that SLX's technical situation is rapidly worsening. It appears the ETF is heading for its lowest closing price since late May 2012. Additionally, SLX's ability to defend $40 is vital to any hopes of a rebound because the ETF has not closed below that level in nearly four years. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-04-03,Inverse ETFs For April Showers,"Yes, April is just days old. And yes, Wednesday's declines come on the heels of the S&P 500 touching a new record high on Tuesday. So perhaps it is too early to get worked up about April being a bad month for stocks. Historically, April is actually a good month for the bulls as the fourth month of the year is last month in the best six-month cycle in which to be long equities. On the other hand, that does not mean the broader market rises every April. Additionally, fortune favors the prepared and with that in mind, traders will want to consider the following inverse ETFs if Wednesday's glum price action is repeated throughout this month. ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN) Not to beat a dead horse, but these are not good days for the materials sector. The first sign of weakness was easily spotted during the first quarter when the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) was the worst-performing of the nine sector SPDRs funds. The negativity surrounding this sector has accelerated in recent days. With regards to SMN, this ETF is the inverse, double-leveraged play on the Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index. That is the same index tracked by the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Sector Index Fund (NYSE: IYM). While IYM is about two-thirds allocated to chemicals names, it is vulnerable to being a baby thrown out with the materials sector bathwater. The ETF is not particularly heavy on coal and steel names, but it includes a few such as Consol Energy (NYSE: CNX), Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF) and U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) further down its lineup. That is bad news for IYM, but good news for traders that opt to give SMN a short-term spin. Multiple steel names are trading at multi-month or multi-year lows. Coal equities and the corresponding ETF are in bad shape as well, buoying the short-term bull case for SMN. ProShares UltraShort MSCI Brazil (NYSE: BZQ) Speaking of weakness in the materials sector, Brazil's Vale (NYSE: VALE), the world's largest iron ore maker, is lower by 20 percent in the past 90 days. And that is with the benefit of Wednesday's two percent gain. Two Vale securities account for 9.7 percent of the weight of the iShares MSCI Brazil Capped Index Fund (NYSE: EWZ), making the stock that ETF's second-largest holdings behind another epic Brazilian disappointment, Petrobras (NYSE: PBR). The simple way of explaining BZQ is that is that is essentially the double-leveraged, inverse equivalent of EWZ. The cautionary tale with BZQ is that it is thinly traded (average daily volume of just 13,640 shares) and that can make for some large intraday moves on a print-by-print basis. The upside is that Brazil continues to be a laggard in 2013, the largest emerging markets of which Brazil is one have been slack performers and there is little reason to be long materials, EWZ's second-largest sector weight. All those factors play in BZQ's favor. Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bear Shares (NYSE: DUST) Things are getting worse for gold. The SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) is playing a dangerous game with support in the $150 area and a move below that level would likely invite increased selling pressure. GLD is off 2.6 percent in the past week. A familiar situation is playing out in the gold pits that means DUST could have plenty more upside ahead of it and that is saying something because the ETF has more than doubled year-to-date. While GLD is down 2.6 percent in the past week, the miners are once again performing worse. Much worse. Much worse as in the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is down 7.4 percent in the past five trading days. In anecdotal evidence regarding investors' disdain for gold miners, the Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (NYSE: NUGT) underwent a reverse split on April and open for trading at a post-split price of just over $25 on Tuesday. NUGT is already flirting with $21. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-05-15,2 Industrial ETFs Your Broker Forgot to Mention,"Here is an interesting anecdote regarding U.S.-focused sector ETFs. Most economic data this year has been solid and the Dow Jones Industrial Average keeps climbing to new all-time highs. However, when looking at the nine sector SPDRs ETFs, investors will find the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: SPDR) in fifth place year-to-date. XLI, which is home to $4.82 billion in assets under management, is the fifth-best SPDR ETF despite a year-to-date gain of 15.4 percent. The fund has narrowly outperformed its energy and utilities counterparts while sharply outpacing the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). It has been low beta sectors that have outperformed over the past three years and maybe that means industrials are ready to take off. If that is the case, investors may want to consider these alternatives to XLI. First Trust Industrials/Producer Durables AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXR) The First Trust Industrials/Producer Durables AlphaDEX Fund stands as another example of an AlphaDEX ETF that is outperforming some of its cap-weighted rivals. FXR,which has almost $166 million in assets, is up nearly 18 percent year-to-date. That is an impressive performance given FXR's almost 15.3 percent allocation to aerospace and defense names, a sub-sector that has performed admirably despite various obstacles provided by U.S. policymakers. Unlike XLI, which devotes 11.6 percent of its weight to just one stock, General Electric (NYSE: GE), no holding in FXR receives an allocation above 1.81 percent. The rub with FXR is that its three-year standard deviation is 120 basis points higher than S&P 500 Industrials Index and year-to-date FXR has been 200 basis points more volatile than XLI. The good news is that FXR's underlying index, the StrataQuant Industrials Index, has outperformed the Russell 1000 Producer Durables Index and the S&P 500 Industrials Index over the past year, three years and five years, according to First Trust data. PowerShares Dynamic Industrials Sector Portfolio (NYSE: PRN) The PowerShares Dynamic Industrials Sector Portfolio is a prime example of industrials ETF that flies under the radar. Like FXR, PRN is a good example of an industrials ETF that eschews cap weighting to produce solid returns. PRN's 60 holdings are evaluated on criteria including price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value. That has helped the $40.3 million ETF gain over 17 percent year-to-date. No holding accounts for more than three percent of PRN's weight, but the ETF's top-10 lineup underscores the notion that this ETF is one to own not only in a thriving economy, but when oil prices are falling as well. Four aerospace companies, including Dow component Boeing (NYSE: BA) are found in PRN's top-10, and three of the other top-10 members are airline stocks. For now at least, it is hard to quibble with that mix as PRN's underlying index, the Dynamic Industrials Sector Intellidex Index, has outperformed the S&P 500 Industrials Index and the Dow Jones U.S. Industrials Index over the past 12 and 36 months, according to PowerShares data.

2013-05-17,Danger Zone: Praxair ,"Praxair Inc. (NYSE: PX) is in the Danger Zone. This conglomerate has run out of ways to fuel profitable growth. The company is turning to acquisitions to try to maintain top line and EPS growth, but that growth is diluting shareholder value. PX spent $294 million on acquisitions of several small packaged gas distributors in 2011, including American Gas Group and Texas Welders Supply Company. The company had an almost identical outlay in acquisition spending for 2012. This acquisition spending does not appear to be aiding growth in the way management hoped, as PX saw after-tax profit (NOPAT) increase by a paltry 2.6% in 2012. This small growth fell far short of the increase in invested capital in 2012, leading to a decline in return on invested capital (ROIC) to 10%. Another example of the high-low fallacy masking overpayment for cash flows with rising EPS. This track record should temper investors’ enthusiasm over Praxair’s recently announced acquisition of NuCO2, a provider of beverage carbonation solutions, for $1.1 billion from Aurora Capital Group. While larger in scale than PX’s past acquisitions, it looks to have a similar effect of slightly increasing earnings while dragging down on ROIC. NuCO2 is expected to generate an EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization) of $115 in 2013. If one assumes NuCO2 will have a similar ratio of NOPAT to EBITDA to PX (about 50%), those earnings should translate to about $57 million in after-tax profit next year. Since ROIC equals invested capital divided by NOPAT, those profits would translate to a 5.2% return on invested capital, well below PX’s current ROIC and weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) of 6.3%. Praxair has offered all the usual platitudes about how synergy will allow NuCO2 to generate more revenue in the future than it did on its own. Executive vice president Eduardo Menezes said of the deal, “We plan to continue to grow the business in the United States, enhance distribution efficiency utilizing Praxair’s competencies in logistics, and extend NuCO2’s offerings to customers in other regions of the world.” That all sounds nice, but I’m skeptical as to how much PX can generate profits from expanding NuCO2’s product around the world as that business is increasingly commoditized. To create shareholder value, PX has to grow economic earnings, not revenue or EPS. The lack of economic earnings growth is not enough to put a company in the Danger Zone. The bigger issue it PX’s high valuation. Investors needs to beware Wall Street’s proclivity to hype stocks that do lots of acquisitions that are accretive to bankers but not shareholders. At ~$115.12/share, PX’s current valuation implies 7% growth in NOPAT compounded annually for the next 11 years. Those expectations set the bar awfully high for a large conglomerate operating in increasingly commoditized businesses. I expect the company will disappoint. PX may be a good company, but it is a dangerous investment. I also recommend avoiding the following ETFs and mutual funds because of their large allocation to PX and Neutral or worse rating. ING Corporate Leaders Trust Fund (MUTF:LEXCX) – 9% allocation to PX – Neutral Rating iShares Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Index (NYSE: IYM) – 7% allocation to PX – Neutral Rating ProShares Ultra Basic Materials (NYSE: UYM) – 7% allocation to PX – Neutral Rating Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) – 7% allocation to PX – Neutral Rating Vanguard World Funds: Vanguard Materials Index Fund (MUTF:VMIAX) – 5% allocation to PX – Dangerous Rating Sam McBride contributed to this report.

2013-06-24,What Is The VIX Saying?,"The CBOE Volatility Index is a measure of the fear in the market. The VIX measures, in percents, the 30-day annualized return in stocks within one standard deviation. So, if the VIX is at 15, it means that the S&P 500 is expected to gain or lose 4.33 percent over the next 30-days with about 68 percent probability. Recent Spike During Market Sell-Off The measure of volatility in stocks usually rises alongside market sell-offs as investors tend to sell quickly and buy slowly. Thus, the recent spike in the VIX, from a low of 11.05 to the current 19.04, implies that the market sees increased volatility in stocks. At the low, the market was expecting a mere 3.2 percent move in stocks but now expects a move of nearly 5.5 percent. Also to note is the velocity at which the VIX tends to rise followed by the much smaller rate at which the index declines. Looking back to 2008 during the financial crisis, the VIX rose to nearly 80 from below 20 in less than a month. Then, it took the VIX over a year to drop back below 20. Overlaying the VIX on the S&P 500, it can be seen that sharp drops in the S&P 500 coincide with large spikes in the VIX while the slow decreases in the VIX coincide with the grinds higher in stocks. The current spike in the VIX has seen a near doubling in market expectations of volatility and fear. Thus, the move may be done. The VIX has already begun to retreat from recent highs and could be signaling that the recent sell-off has been overdone and that stocks are at least due for a correction. Strong Call Buying Chatter of strong buying of 1,600 call options in the S&P 500 Monday morning means that investors were betting on a bounce off of this morning's low in the current future of 1,553.25. Also, the futures held technical support at 1,552 and have further support slightly below. Thus, the move lower may at least be due for a breather. Now, the strong call buying could also just be a sign of traders looking to pick up quick profit on a correction in stocks. And sure enough, S&P 500 futures have rallied nearly 15 points off of the lows after the early morning plunge and are fast approaching the closing level from Friday. Should the VIX hold at current levels, it would most likely mark a bottom in stocks. After all, not much has fundamentally changed in the economy except for the Federal Reserve warning that it may stop buying bonds at a record pace in the near future; and recent Chinese fears may actually be overdone because the smart money has been raising fears over China and emerging markets as a whole for a while now. What to Look For A stabilization of the VIX and a slow, orderly decline in the index would be a sign that the market has found a bottom. Also, relaxed bearish comments on the global economy and statements from the Fed that tapering may not be so bad will all be signs that a correction in stocks may be ending. If this is the case, materials stocks that were hammered, especially on Monday, could see a nice bounce back on some short covering. Also, watch housing stocks if rates begin to decline after the massive move higher in interest rates in late May and so far in June. Lower rates would be a bullish sign for housing stocks and signal relaxed fears about the Fed and tapering."

2013-07-11,S&P Bullish on a Trio of Tech ETFs,"It may be the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, but year-to-date, technology has offered something of a middling performance. Using the nine sector SPDR ETFs as the benchmarks, investors will find that the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK), though up nearly 10 percent this year, is the second-worst performer of that group. Only the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is keeping XLK from the bottom spot. Part of the reason for that tepid performance was slack first-half earnings growth, but that could change in the latter half of this year. Combine that with an improving dividend story for the sector and now might be the time for investors to consider select tech ETFs. In a new research note, S&P Capital IQ highlights three technology ETFs it is bullish on. The research firm said of 44 technology ETFs in its coverage universe, only six receive Overweight ratings. Capital IQ data indicate flat operating EPS in the first quarter and consensus estimates indicate a decline for the second quarter, but a notable improvement in the second half, with expected growth of 7% for the third quarter and 10% for the fourth quarter, owing in part to easier comparisons, said the research firm in the note. One of the ETFs S&P Capital IQ has an Overweight rating on is the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE: IYW), a fund that previously rose to acclaim then infamy for its large weight to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). IYW, which is up nearly eight percent year-to-date, still features features one of the largest ETF weights to Apple at nearly 16 percent. The fund's other top-10 holdings include International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL), EMC (NYSE: EMC) and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Including Apple, those stocks combine for over 44 percent of IYW's weight. S&P Capital IQ has five-star ratings on Apple, EMC and Qualcomm and four-star ratings on Cisco, IBM, EMC and Intel. The firm also has an Overweight rating on the $588.1 million iShares North American Tech ETF (NYSE: IGM), which has impressed with a 13.1 percent gain this year. IGM is focused explicitly on North American-based tech names, but there is plenty of duplication of between this fund and IYW. IGM's top-10 holdings include Apple, IBM, Cisco, Oracle, Intel and Qualcomm, but those stocks combine for less than 30 percent of the ETF's weight. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) and Microsemi (NASDAQ: MSCC), which S&P also has four-star ratings on, are smaller members of IGM's lineup. IGM's three-year standard deviation of 16.82 percent is slightly below the 17.35 percent found on IYW, according to iShares data. S&P Capital IQ also has an Overweight rating on the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (NYSE: VGT), one of the largest and least expensive tech ETFs on the market. With an expense ratio of just 0.14 percent per year, VGT is cheaper than 91 percent of comparable funds, according to Vanguard. VGT's top-10 lineup is similar to the other funds highlighted here with Apple, IBM, Oracle, Qualcomm, Cisco and Intel (in that order) found in that group. Apple was VGT's largest holding at the end of the first quarter with a weight of 13.6 percent. Those stocks combine for 35.1 percent of VGT's weight. VGT is competes directly with XLK as well and year-to-date, the Vanguard offering is slightly ahead with returns of 10.4 percent. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-07-30,SPY: Banks Could be Boss Again,"The technology sector has some serious competition for supremacy in the S&P 500. Amid a lethargic performance for that sector and soaring shares of banks, brokers and insurance providers, financial services is nipping at tech's heels for the top sector weighting in the S&P 500. Naysayers note that the last time financials were the biggest industry was in 2008, Bloomberg reported. Investors know how well that turned out. The SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY), the world's largest ETF, allocated 17.54 percent of its weight to tech as of the close of markets on July 26. SPY's weight to financial services was 16.79 percent. In the S&P 500 itself, the allocations were 17.55 percent and 16.84 percent, according to State Street data. While SPY's weight to financials has doubled since the dark days of the financial crisis in early 2009, it is almost surprising the sector has yet to pass tech this year. As expected, financials have been one of a few bright spots in second quarter earnings season. Tech not so much. Year-to-date, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) is the second-best performer among the nine sector SPDR ETFs, trailing only the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV). XLF is up 25.9 percent, roughly two and a half times the 10.6 percent gain offered by the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK). Of the nine sector SPDRs, only the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) has been worse than XLK this year. Related: Risk On Rally? These ETFs Say No Three tech stocks – Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) – are currently members of SPY's top-10 lineup. Just two financials are – Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-B) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) – and those are SPY's ninth- and tenth-largest holdings, respectively. History: Not All Bad While the financial crisis is still fresh on investors' minds, U.S. stocks actually have impressive records when banks are the S&P 500's largest sector. That was the case in 2002, a rough year for U.S. stocks, but from that year through the end of 2007, SPY gained over 20 percent. In the late 1990s, financial firms grew to 18.8 percent of the index, according to Bloomberg, and that gave way to one of the great bull markets, and yes, a tech-induced bear market, in history. Part of the reason for financials' resurgence is dividend growth. Banks were among the most egregious dividend cutters during the global credit crisis, but recovery in the sector has given way to dividend growth. Granted, that growth is coming off a low post-crisis basis, but soaring financial services dividends have helped dividend ETFs with ample exposure to the sector outperform payout funds that are light on bank stocks. For example, over the past two years, the WisdomTree Total Dividend Fund (NYSE: DTD) is up 35.1 percent, a performance that trumps that largest U.S. dividend ETF. DTD has a 17.6 percent weight to financials, more than double that of the largest payout ETF. Boding well for future dividend growth out of U.S. banks is the fact that Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE: C), two members of SPY's top-20 lineup, have nowhere to go but up with their payouts. Both companies still pay dividends of just four cents a share per year. In third quarter of 2008, Bank of America paid a dividend of 64 cents a share. Equal-Weight In the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal-Weight ETF (NYSE: RSP), a fund with a penchant for outpacing SPY, tech already takes a back seat to financials, though both are behind consumer discretionary for sector supremacy. Financials account for 16.43 percent of RSP's weight, 237 basis points ahead of tech and just 21 basis points behind discretionary. That indicates financials could become the biggest sector weight in RSP before doing so in SPY. The wider difference between the two sectors and/or the lower allocation to tech might also explain why RSP has outpaced SPY by 230 basis points this year. For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-07-30,Seasonal Trends: Three ETFs To Own In August,"There is just one day left in July so there is no time like the present to start evaluating ETFs that have a tendency to perform well in August. August is not the greatest month of the year in which to be long stocks. Over the past 62 years, the S&P 500 rose 35 times during the month of August, making the eighth month of the year the ninth-best in terms of performance for the benchmark U.S. index, according to The Stock Trader's Almanac. Dismissing seasonal trends as coincidence can be hazardous to a portfolio's health. For example, Benzinga pointed out earlier this year that February marks the beginning of a strong four-month stretch in which to own energy stocks. ETFs including the iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: IEO) and the Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSE: VDE) honored that trend by turning in solid performances from February through May this year. With August right around the corner, these are some of the ETFs investors should consider. Related: Sound of the Seasons: More ETFs for Seasonal Trends. iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB) Or the Market Vectors Biotech ETF (NYSE: BBH) or any other biotech ETF for that matter.

2013-07-30,Seasonal Trends: Three ETFs to Own in August,"There is just one day left in July so there is no time like the present to start evaluating ETFs that have a tendency to perform well in August. August is not the greatest month of the year in which to be long stocks. Over the past 62 years, the S&P 500 rose 35 times during the month of August, making the eighth month of the year the ninth-best in terms of performance for the benchmark U.S. index, according to The Stock Trader's Almanac. Dismissing seasonal trends as coincidence can be hazardous to a portfolio's health. For example, we pointed out earlier this year that February marks the beginning of a strong four-month stretch in which to own energy stocks. ETFs including the iShares U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: IEO) and the Vanguard Energy ETF (NYSE: VDE) honored that trend by turning in solid performances from February through May this year. With August right around the corner, these are some of the ETFs investors should consider.

2013-08-12,A Look Ahead: This Week's ETF's to Watch,"Last week was one to forget as U.S. stocks skidded to their worst weekly performance in nearly two months. A cacophony of tapering chatter from various members of the Federal Reserve was the culprit in a week that was otherwise light on economic data. Valuations may also be playing a part in investors' skittishness toward stocks. The S&P 500 now trades at 15.3 projected earnings, up from a multiple of 13.1 at the beginning of this year, Bloomberg reported. There is that little tidbit and the fact that August, as has been mentioned plenty of times already, is not usually a great month to be long stocks and that seasonal trend appears to be at play again this year. Related: Seasonal Trends: Three ETFs to Own in August. Some ETFs are already showing signs of dodging the late summertime blues. Plenty are worth monitoring in the week ahead. Here are a few to keep in mind. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) The Materials Select Sector SPDR, to this point in 2013 the worst performer among the nine sector SPDRs, turned in a decent performance last month. That gain for XLB was helped in large part by news that investor Nelson Peltz had amassed a large stake in Dow component DuPont (NYSE: DD), XLB's largest holding. On a related note, there was unusual options activity spotted last week in Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) on speculation a yet-to-be identified activist investor has built a position in that stocks. For XLB shareholders, this is important news because Dow Chemical is the ETF's third-largest holding at a weight of 8.8 percent. With over 19 percent of XLB's weight reportedly drawing attention from activist investors, the under-performing ETF is one to watch in the weeks ahead. Vanguard Financials ETF (NYSE: VFH) Or just about any other large financial services ETF that is heavy on big-name bank stocks. And the reason extends beyond the fact that the financial services sector trails only consumer discretionary and health care for the title of 2013'2 top-performing. As was noted a couple of weeks ago, financial services are close to reclaiming the top sector weight in the S&P 500. That would be the first time the sector has worn that crown in more than five years. And it is the big banks that have been leading the sector's charge this year. Banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup (NYSE: C) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC). Those stocks combine for about 18 percent of VFH's weight. iShares MSCI BRIC ETF (NYSE: BKF) Well-documented is the fact that BRIC ETFs have not lived up to expectations this year. In fact, ETFs tracking Brazil, Russia, India and China, be they single-country or combination funds, have been utter disappointments. What makes the iShares MSCI BRIC ETF an interesting play at the moment is that the ETF is on the cusp of breaking resistance created by a multi-month downtrend line. Same goes for the largest China and Brazil ETFs and that is important because those two countries combine for over 69 percent of BKF's weight. For more on ETFs, click here."

Of the nine sector SPDRs ETFs, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) has been the worst performer in 2013, though to be fair to XLB, the fund is up 3.2 percent in the past month. Investors willing to refine their materials ETF search will find even more impressive, recent gains. The Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL) is up 6.6 percent in the past week. Seven holdings in the Market Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE: SLX) have posted double-digit gains in just the past three days, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Related: A New ETF For Resurgent Coal Stocks. The list goes on from there. Just look at this roster of unheralded materials ETFs. First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXZ) Year-to-date, the First Trust Materials AlphaDEX fund has performed in line with larger rivals such as XLB, but over the past three months the AlphaDEX methodology has helped FXZ to start breaking away from the pack. Nearly 34 percent of FXZ's weight is allocated to chemicals names. Not a bad place to be when Air Products (NYSE: APD), DuPont (NYSE: DD) and Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW) are drawing interest from activist investors. However, FXZ is not heavy on those names. Those stocks combine for just 3.5 percent of the ETF's weight. Now stock has a weight of over 3.9 percent in the $255.6 million FXZ. FXZ's 54 holdings have a median market value of $5.7 billion and the ETF sports a price-to-book ratio of 1.92 and a price-to-cash-flow ratio of 8.3. EGShares Basic Materials GEMS ETF (NYSE: LGEM) For most of this year, the combination of materials and emerging markets under the umbrella has been a toxic brew, something that has happened before with this ETF. That much is affirmed by LGEM's 32.2 percent year-to-date decline. However, LGEM has perked up in significant fashion. Since putting in double bottom around $9, the ETF has reclaimed its 50-day moving average and is now flirting with $10. An emerging markets ETF heavy on materials stocks is bound to be heavy on South Africa, Brazil and LGEM is. Those countries combine for over 48 percent of the ETF's weight, giving the fund considerable leverage to a rebound in base and precious metals prices. As is the case with many emerging markets ETFs, LGEM is discounted with a price-to-book ratio of 1.19. Investors are compensated for the risk with an index yield of 4.9 percent, according to EGShares data. The rival iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Materials ETF (NASDAQ: EMMT) is up 4.7 percent in the past week. iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. Materials ETF (NYSE: AXMT) The iShares MSCI ACWI ex U.S. Materials ETF will be met with predictable criticism for its small size (just $2.3 million in assets under management) and lack of volume (just 200 shares per day), but this ETF is up nine percent in the past month. Earlier, we mentioned the Market Vectors Steel ETF and some of that fund's stocks that have recently been surging. Some strong SLX constituents, such as Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), Posco (NYSE: PKX), Vale (NYSE: VALE) and ArcelorMittal (NYSE: MT) are also found in AXMT. The drawback is AXMT's exposure to beaten up fertilizer names. The fund holds 153 stocks and has an annual expense ratio of 0.48 percent. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-09-03,Rising Rates Could Make These ETFs Betray Seasonal Trends,"September is here and that may not be good news for those long stocks. August was the worst month for U.S. equities since May 2012. It was also the worst month for ETF outflows since January 2010. Bring on September, the month that is usually the worst of the year for stocks. That is right. For the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite, September is the 12th-best month on the calendar in terms of performance. Related: Three ETFs To Own In August. While August is no picnic and September has a tendency to be even worse, some sectors prove more durable than others during these months. Just as February marks the start of a strong four-month period for energy stocks, the staples and utilities sectors usually lead in August and September. Things could be different this year because of rising interest rates. For the 14 previous years for which data is available on the sector SPDR ETFs, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) is the top performer of the nine SPDRs in August followed by the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU). In September, the two ETFs switch with XLU ranking as the best of the nine and XLP in second place. Last month, XLP fell 5.3 percent while XLU tumbled 5.8 percent. Well-documented is the inverse correlation of some popular dividend sectors, including utilities, to rising interest rates. That scenario is playing out again Tuesday as yields on 10-year Treasuries are soaring by over five percent, while XLU is off nearly one percent. XLU has a dividend yield of nearly four percent while the rival Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSE: VPU) yields 3.6 percent, alluring numbers for income investors, but ones that did not stop S&P Capital IQ from merely rating the two ETFs Marketweight last month. As for staples, the sector is is middling at best during rising rates environments. XLP's correlation to the iShares Barclays 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSE: TLT), although negative, is the second-highest among the nine sector SPDRs behind XLU. On days that TLT has traded higher over the past decade, only XLU and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV) have few up days than XLP among the nine SPDRs, according to ETF Replay data. As for down days when TLT rises, XLP ranks in the middle as four other SPDRs fall more frequently when TLT rises. Bottom line: Staples and utilities may seem like shelter from the September storm plays, but this year may not be the year to put that theory to work because of rising rates. For those wanting to know which SPDR is worst in September, that dubious honor goes to the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). For more on ETFs, click here.

2013-09-03,Three Bearish Leveraged ETFs For September,"September has a bad, though well-deserved reputation as the worst month of the year for stocks. On a historical basis, it is the worst month of the year for the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 1000. Small-caps are sort of less bad as there are two months that are less kind to the Russell 2000 than September. Related: Three ETFs To Own In August. This September has the potential to be even more volatile than recent editions of the ninth month of the year. August saw the largest monthly outflows from U.S. ETFs since early 2010. President Obama continues to mull a military strike against Syria and 10-year Treasury yields continue a a dangerous flirtation with the three percent level. With a rocky September possibly in the offing, investors would do well to get acquainted with the following ETFs as short-term trades for this month. ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials (NYSE: SMN) Did you know that of the nine sector SPDRs none make more frequent appearances as the worst performer in a given month than the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). XLB holds that dubious distinction in three months of the year, including September. XLB's slack historical September performances are usually an extension of a trend that started in August when the ETF is also usually the worst SPDR. The ProShares UltraShort Basic Materials attempts to deliver twice the daily inverse returns of the Dow Jones U.S. Basic Materials Index. That is not XLB's underlying index. Rather, it is the benchmark for the iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF (NYSE: IYM), which is to say one needs keep an eye on IYM if one is long SMN. ProShares UltraShort Utilities (NYSE: SDP) The suggestion of the often overlooked ProShares UltraShort Utilities would seem to go against conventional wisdom that shows the utilities sector is usually decent or less bad in September. That is the case on a historical basis, but with Treasury yields rising, rate-sensitive sectors are not to be trusted in the month ahead. SDP seeks to deliver twice the daily inverse returns of the Dow Jones U.S. Utilities Index, which is the underlying index for the iShares U.S. Utilities ETF (NYSE: IDU). Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: ERY) The Stock Trader's Almanac shows investors that September is usually a good time to short oil. That could again be the case this year, particularly if some of the Syria premium comes out of crude futures. The Direxion Daily Energy Bear 3X Shares is an ideal play for risk-tolerant, active traders looking to profit from declines in energy equities. ERY is the triple-leveraged, bearish answer to the popular Energy Select SPDR (NYSE: XLE). What that means is when one is long ERY, one wants to see stocks like Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron (NYSE: CVX) fall. Traders looking to participate in downside for oil futures should consider the PowerShares DB Crude Oil Double Short ETN (NYSE: DTO). For more on ETFs, click here."
2013-09-04,An Interesting Year For Tech ETFs,"On the surface, it would appear to be a disappointing year for technology sector ETFs. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) is up a mere 9.9 percent year-to-date, a performance that trails the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE: SPY) by 670 basis points. Of the nine sector SPDRs ETFs, XLK ranks seventh on a year-to-date basis and is being kept out of the last place by the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU), the latter of which has wilted in the face of rising interest rates. What is disappointing about the performance of the cap-weighted, large cap-focused XLK is that when stripping out AT&T (NYSE: T) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ) to focus on the pure tech names among the ETF's top-10 holdings, five of the remaining eight names have traded higher this year. In fact, XLK is not even the best U.S. technology sector ETF issued by State Street Global Advisors. That honor goes to the SPDR Morgan Stanley Technology ETF (NYSE: MTK), which has returned 15.3 percent this year with some help from Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) and Priceline.com (NASDAQ: PCLN). Related: The Race To $1,000 ETF You've Never Heard Of. Still, it is possible to find market-beating U.S.-focused tech ETFs. Even when excluding the PowerShares S&P SmallCap Information Technology Portfolio (NASDAQ: PSCT), has been a stellar performer in its own right, investors could have done this year with tech ETFs this year. The right tech ETFs that is. Some of this year's top tech ETFs share an important trait in common. These funds offer investors exposure to the increasingly prominent theme of fundamental weighting methodologies. Take the PowerShares Dynamic Technology Sector Portfolio (NYSE: PTF) as one example. PTF is weighted by factors including rice momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value. None of the ETF's 61 holdings account for more than 2.82 percent of the fund's weight. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is not a member of PTF's lineup, which is a good thing given that the stock has traded lower this year. However, PTF has gained 14.4 percent this year while also excluding Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), just to name a pair of large-cap tech stocks that have performed well in 2013. Speaking of Apple, well-documented has been the stock's impact on various ETFs and how funds with excessive to the stock are vulnerable when Apple falls. Equal-weight ETFs avoid that conundrum. The First Trust NASDAQ-100-Technology Sector Index Fund (NASDAQ: QTEC) and the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Technology ETF (NYSE: RYT) are up an average of 20.5 percent this year. Both funds feature scant allocations to Apple, but the same goes for their exposure to Google. RYT actually has a slightly larger weight to Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO) than it does Google. RYT is up 21.6 this year, meaning it has topped Google by 260 basis points. The First Trust Technology AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE: FXL) also eschews cap-weighting in favor of a mix of growth and value factors, including price appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets. Apple happens to be FXL's largest holding at 2.3 percent of the fund's weight. The 1.35 percent allocation to Google is well below the weights given to 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD), Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN) and Yahoo, just to name a few. The result is an ETF up 19.6 this year. Another thing these ETFs share in common is not none are particularly large, though three have over $100 million in assets under management. Combined, PTF, QTEC, RYT and FXL have about $707 million in AUM compared to $11.3 billion for XLK. For more on ETFs, click here. Disclosure: Author does not own any of the securities mentioned here."
2013-10-11,"Two Boring ETFs for All Investors (XLB, XLI)","When the stock market is hitting fresh all-time highs and investors are clamoring for the next big thing the slow and steady are often overlooked. Think of the story of the tortoise and the hare. There are two tortoise ETFs that have been moving along in a smooth uptrend that investors have been ignoring. SPDR Select Sector Industrials ETF (NYSE: XLI) A basket of 65 stocks that cover a wide variety of sectors and provides investors with instant diversification. The ETF is most heavily weighted in the aerospace & defense (26 percent), machinery (19 percent), industrial conglomerates (18 percent), and road & rail (9 percent). The top stocks are the who’s who of industry with General Electric (NYSE: GE), United Technologies (NYSE: UTX), and Boeing (NYSE: BA) the largest holdings. The ETF has managed to beat the overall market in 2013 with a gain of 23 percent. A recent pullback brought the ETF back to support before it has been able to restart the uptrend. The chart is a perfect example of an uptrend with a series of higher highs and higher lows. The absence of large moves in either direction may put the ETF in the “boring” category, however it is tough to argue with the gains and the fact it hit an all-time high last month. SPDR Select Sector Materials ETF (NYSE: XLB) The materials stocks have not had as good of a 2013 as the industrials and the chart is not as impressive, however the sector should not be ignored. XLB is an example of an ETF that is often mis-perceived due to its name. When investors think materials the first thought is of industrials metals or miners. When in reality the majority of the stocks in the ETF are chemical companies. The ETF is made up of 33 stocks with 74 percent in the chemicals sector, 15 percent in metals & mining, and 6 percent in paper & forest products. The top four holdings are all chemical stocks that make up 37 percent of the entire ETF. They are Monsanto (NYSE: MON), E.I. du Pont de Nemours (NYSE: DD), Dow Chemical (NYSE: DOW), and Praxair (NYSE: PX). The ETF is lagging the market with a gain of 13 percent this year, but a recent bounce off price support has the ETF poised to retest the all-time high set in 2008. We all know who won the race between the tortoise and the hare and many times when it comes to investing the hare prevails. Do not ignore the two ETFs above longer."

However, for the year the index remains lower by one point. The microcap stocks on the other hand continue to outperform the large-cap stocks again this year as measured by IWC. The ETF is up 3.4 percent in 2014 and is closing in on the all-time high set in January. The ETF is now overbought and could see some healthy selling in the coming days before attempting a breakout, but the trend remains very bullish. SPDR Materials ETF (NYSE: XLB) The ETF traded 2 pennies above the all-time high from 2008 on Friday before closing in the red. Yesterday the ETF came with 4 cents of the all-time high again before closing near the low of the day. Add in an RSI that is overbought and moving lower and the odds are a pullback is in store for the ETF. Another red flag is the volume, which was more than double yesterday as the selling picked up near the end of the trading day. Support on XLB is at the $45 area in the event the chart is correct and a pullback is imminent. United States Gasoline ETF (NYSE: UGA) The average U.S. price for a gallon of gasoline has risen for 17 straight days, the longest streak since May. The increase has added 15 cents to the price per gallon, however the price still remains 36 cents below the high of last year. UGA closed at a multi-month high last week and has been consolidating at the area for the last couple of days. If the ETF can hold above $60/share it could push the price back to the next resistance level of $64. Global X FTSE Nordic Region ETF (NYSE: GXF) The Nordic countries closed out a strong showing at the Winter Olympics and the countries continued to celebrate Monday as GXF rallied 2 percent to a new all-time high. The breakout on Monday was significant because the ETF has struggled to break above $24.75 for the last few months before the big move. The one issue with GXF is that it only traded 2,800 shares on Monday, which could make it difficult for investors to initiate large positions. The ETF is heavily weighted towards Sweden (53 percent) and also has exposure to Denmark, Norway, and Finland."

Despite the weak opening on Monday morning, these market leaders have the opportunity to turn around their recent misfortunes if we see stabilization in the broader market.

Alcoa represents approximately 2.3 percent of the underlying holdings in XLB. XLB hit a new all-time high last week, but has fallen prey to broader market weakness over the last two trading sessions.

Third quarter earnings will be kicking off this week as well. Related Link: Third Quarter ETF Fund Flows Show Broad Market Buying Here are the key ETFs to watch for the week of Monday, October 6: iShares Russell 2000 Index ETF (NYSE: IWM) This broad-based index of small cap stocks has been a serial under-performer all year, leading to concerns that demand has waned for high beta equities. IWM retested its 2014 lows last week and was able to hold those prior support levels as buyers stepped in on Thursday and Friday. Earlier in the month, IWM was criticized because its technical price pattern signaled a “death cross,” whereby the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. Despite those concerns, if IWM can build off last week's momentum, it will be a strong vote of support for the broader market. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) On Wednesday, Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA) will kick off third quarter earnings season after the closing bell. This key aluminum manufacturer makes up 3 percent of XLB and will help set the tone for additional earnings expectations in the materials sector. XLB currently has $5 billion dedicated to 32 large-cap chemicals, metals, paper products and container companies.

So far this year, TLT has gained over 18 percent and is currently trading near its recent highs despite the upbeat jobs data released on Friday. Treasuries may be impacted this week by the FOMC minutes along with further developments in stocks.

2014-10-08,Merger Boosts Materials ETFs,"The chemicals sector has been consolidating of late, and M&A can mean a premium for shareholders. In September Germany-based Merck KGaA announced its purchase of Sigma-Aldrich Castello Di Borghese (NASDAQ: SIAL) for $17 billion in cash, a 37 percent premium to SIAL’s closing price pre-announcement. SIAL is a manufacturer of chemicals and laboratory kits used in scientific research. While this consolidation trend may continue, it is very difficult to attempt to pick the specific stocks that will be taken over. A lower risk strategy is to invest in the chemicals sector through an ETF. Related Link: Encana Corporation-Athlon Energy Inc Deal A Potential Boost To These ETFs Two ETFs concentrate on the materials sector, but analyzing their portfolios shows that the majority of the stocks are in the chemicals sector. Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW) VAW seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the returns of publicly traded companies in the materials sector. It consists of 132 companies, but the top ten holdings make up just under 50 percent of the entire ETF. The top holdings include The Dow Chemical Company, E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co, and Monsanto Company. Approximately two-thirds of the ETF is invested in chemical stocks. VAW is up 19 percent of the last 12 months, and up 7 percent over the last six months. VAW has an expense ratio of 0.14 percent, beating most of its competitors. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) XLB follows 32 publicly traded companies in the materials sector. The portfolio is distributed across five subsectors. The top two are chemicals, at 74 percent, and metals and mining at 13 percent. XLB has the same top holdings as VAW but in a different order; du Pont is the top holding, followed by Monsanto and Dow Chemical. XLB has performed well, up 20 percent over the last 12 months, and 7 percent over the last six months. XLB boasts a favorable 0.16 percent expense ratio. Both ETFs are a play on more potential mergers in the chemical sector and also offer exposure to companies that should do well during the continued stock market rally and global economic rebound."
2014-11-24,"China, Materials And Semiconductor ETFs To Watch This Week","After a short-term period of consolidation, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) jumped 1 percent higher to end last week. This strength was driven by confirmation of additional stimulus from central banks in Europe and China, along with better than expected U.S. economic data. The week ahead features a holiday shortened session with the markets closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving. They will resume for a half day on the notorious black Friday shopping extravaganza. Here are the key ETFs to watch for the week of Monday, November 24: iShares China Large-Cap ETF (NYSE: FXI) Chinese stocks received a boost last week when its central bank opted to reduce the benchmark interest rate for the first time since July 2012. This unexpected maneuver is intended to stimulate economic growth and boosted FXI nearly 4 percent higher on Friday. Related Link: Keep Warm This Thanksgiving With This Natural Gas ETF FXI is the largest China-focused ETF that tracks 56 underlying large-cap stocks and quasi-government agencies. FXI is sitting on a modest 4 percent gain this year that has the potential to extend higher if these stimulus measures are well received by international investors. Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) The materials sector was hard hit in October as commodities fell to their lowest levels of the year. XLB follows 32 large-cap stocks engaged in chemicals metals and packaging. Dow Chemical Co (NYSE: DOW) and Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) are two of the top five holdings in this benchmark sector ETF. XLB has rebounded significantly from its October sell-off and is now retesting its prior 2014 high. Traders will be watching this ETF closely for a confirmed breakout behind strong momentum that has the potential to pull the rest of the market along with it. iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX) Semiconductor stocks received a boost last week when industry titan Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) announced an increase in its already hefty dividend payment. SOXX tracks 31 companies in the semiconductor sector and hit a new 52-week high on Friday. This ETF has gained 25 percent since the beginning of the year, making it one of the brightest technology groups to date in 2014. A continuation of this uptrend will be a positive sign for the broader sector benchmark Technology Select Sector SPDR as well."
2015-03-30,"Materials, Technology And Gold ETFs To Watch This Week","The air once again came out of stocks last week as continued unsteady price action underscores the heightened volatility this year. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) is sitting just above the flat line in 2015 and the end of the quarter is only a few short days away. The week ahead features several important economic releases including core inflation, Case-Shiller home price index, motor vehicle sales, and unemployment data. Here are the key ETFs to watch for the week of Monday, March 30: Material Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) Basic materials stocks have experienced a bumpy start to the year that included a slingshot higher in February followed by a slow bleed lower through March. XLB has nearly $3 billion dedicated to 31 large-cap companies engaged in chemical, mining and packaging industries. Mining companies in particular have been under pressure as commodity prices continue their deflationary trend. This ETF slipped below its 200-day moving average last week and is proving to be one of the weaker sectors over the last month. If XLB can regain its footing in the week ahead, it may prove to be a positive sign for the market as a whole. Related Link: 3 Earnings To Bring This Season To A Close iShares Exponential Technologies ETF (NYSE: XT) Companies engaged in global technological advancement are the underpinnings for a new cutting-edge technology fund from Barclays. XT just recently debuted as a way to access a diversified portfolio of world-wide stocks with strong potential for innovation. XT was seeded with over $500 million in assets spread among 198 publicly traded companies. The United States represents two-thirds of the fund, which is heavily weighted towards solar and biotechnology stocks. This new ETF will be one to watch in the coming weeks as a unique option for investors seeking revolutionary technology exposure across a broad range of industries. SPDR Gold Shares ETF (NYSE: GLD) Gold bullion has re-emerged as a potential hiding spot amid the volatility in stocks. GLD recently re-tested the $110 level, which proved to be a strong line of support that was established last November. This heavily traded ETF has now bounced 5 percent higher and may be offering investors a glimpse at another rally attempt. GLD has been unable to escape the deflationary spiral in commodities, but will give some short-term traders an interesting look next week as additional economic data is released."

2015-07-05,"Materials, Europe And China ETFs To Watch This Week","The upcoming week will once again signal the start to earnings season, which will be kicked off by Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA) on Wednesday. The quarterly results will be a welcome distraction for U.S. investors from the pessimistic headlines in overseas markets. In addition to earnings announcements, key economic events to watch will include: FOMC minutes, weekly jobless claims, and wholesale inventories. Here are the key ETFs to watch for the week of July 6: Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE: XLB) Basic materials stocks will certainly be in focus this week as aluminum producer Alcoa releases their latest fiscal results. This stock is represented in the sector benchmark XLB, which tracks 31 large-cap chemical, mining, and materials companies. This ETF just recently fell below both its 50 and 200-day moving averages and is trading near the flat-line for the year. Many of the underlying stocks in this sector are likely feeling the bite from a stronger U.S. dollar and weak global commodity prices. Nevertheless, XLB has the potential to reverse its recent losses if Alcoa can muster a positive story for this embattled sector. iShares Europe ETF (NYSE: IEV) While the Global X FTSE Greece 20 ETF (NYSE: GREK) has been a core focus for international investors, the fiscal fallout in other areas of Europe is a concern as well. ETF investors would be well-served to keep an eye on IEV, which has $2.9 billion dedicated to 355 stocks of developed European nations. The United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, and Germany make up the top four country allocations in IEV. Despite strength in the first half of 2015, IEV recently fell to new 3-month lows and further friction or uncertainty with Greece in the coming week may threaten its year-to-date gains. Deutsche X-trackers Harvest CSI 300 China A-Shares ETF (NYSE: ASHR) The continued destruction in China’s stock market has reached critical mass as top brokerage companies band together to try and stabilize plummeting equity valuations. ASHR tracks the 300 largest and most liquid China A-share stocks traded on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges. This ETF is down over 22 percent from its recent high in just a few short weeks and has yet to show signs of a bottom. Investors will be closely watching if the new crisis efforts can positively impact broad-based China indexes such as ASHR in the coming week."
2015-09-01,Conservative Sector ETF Ideas For September,"September is here and that is great news for fans of American football, but financial market data indicate equity bulls would do well to curb what enthusiasm they have left after a trying August. For believers in seasonal trends, it must be noted that over the last 20 Septembers, the S&P has posted an average performance of zero. The benchmark U.S. equity index is traditionally flat in September over that period, according to Equity Clock data. That does not mean sector-level opportunities cease to exist in the ninth month. Rather, the opposite is true, but if history repeats in September 2015, investors will want to take a conservative approach to sector exchange traded funds this month. Utilities The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU) is usually the top performer among the nine sector SPDRs in the month of September, averaging a modest gain in the ninth month of the year, according to CXO Advisory. Related Link: This Oil ETF Rally Should Be Handled With Kid Gloves XLU is in the midst of what is supposed to be a seasonally strong period for the largest utilities ETF as the fund is usually the second-best of the nine SPDRs in August. Indeed, XLU lived up to that track record, but underscoring just how poorly stocks performed last month, XLU lost 4 percent. Only the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) was better among the nine SPDRs. Consumer Staples According to CXO data, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) is usually the second-best of the nine SPDRs this month, though like the S&P 500, is usually about flat this month, reminding investors that sometimes less bad is good. However, before backing up the bus on XLP, investors should note that the largest staples ETF was usually the best of the sector SPDRs in August, but that historical data did not mean much as XLP tumbled 6.1 percent last month. Materials & Tech In terms of the worst of the nine SPDRs in September, that dubious honor goes to the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) followed by the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK). This is where things get interesting and those things are a reminder that seasonal trading often requires the user to be nimble. Historical data, courtesy of CXO, indicate XLU is usually the best SPDR this month, but that is before it turns into October's worst. Conversely, XLK is historically the second-worst SPDR in September before it becomes the best of the nine in October. Image credit: John McStravick, Flickr"

2015-09-27,ETF Outlook: More Biotech Blunders Or A Biotech Bounce?,"Stocks' September shenanigans continued last week as the S&P 500 lost more than one percent and although the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a triple-digit gain last Friday, a problem is surfacing: Increasingly bearish action in the biotechnology space. It is not a stretch to say that in the week ahead, this is an issue that traders of and investors in exchange traded funds will be heavily focusing on. That much is confirmed when noting the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ: IBB), the largest biotech ETF, slumped 13 percent last week and will enter Monday at its lowest levels in a month. With last week's tumble, IBB now resides nearly 11 percent below its 200-day moving average. As an equal-weight ETF, the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (NYSE: XBI) has heavier exposure to smaller biotechs than does the rival IBB. So it is not surprising that XBI was worse for the wear last week, sliding 15 percent. Alas, readers of this space have been consistently illuminated as to how to profit from a biotech decline as the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: LABD) has been highlighted here multiple times over the past two months. LABD, the triple-leveraged answer to XBI, gained over 60 percent last week. Investors should be careful with thinking that broad market ETFs will provide insulation from further biotech retrenchment. Health care is the third-largest sector weight in the S&P 500, accounting for more than 15 percent of that index's weight. The PowerShares QQQ (NASDAQ: QQQ), the NASDAQ-100 tracking ETF, has a health care weight of 14.1 percent. Since it is the Nasdaq we're talking about in the case of QQQ, health care usually means biotech. That means more biotech declines muddle the near-term outlook for the Nasdaq and QQQ. Stepping away from biotech, there are more problems with the potential to confound investors, namely slack earnings. Cyclical sectors look particularly vulnerable. “Earnings for the commodity-sensitive materials are expected to fall 13.8 percent, while industrials' earnings are seen down 3.6 percent,” according to Reuters. Last week, Dow component Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT), an industrial stock with heavy materials exposure, slid 9.6 percent. Caterpillar's slide has pushed the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLI) to a double-digit year-to-date loss while the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is threatening the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) for the dubious honor of 2015's worst-performing sector SPDR. XLB and XLE are down 16.1 percent and 19.5 percent, respectively, year-to-date. Speaking of XLE and rival energy ETFs, earnings season is going to be dismal. That sectors third-quarter earnings are expected to tumble by nearly 65 percent. In the world of commodities, the ETFS Physical Palladium Shares (NYSE: PALL) is worth a look in the week ahead because PALL, perhaps more than any other ETF, was the prime beneficiary of the Volkswagen controversy. It is a simple equation. The Volkswagen controversy, in large part, involves diesel automobiles. Palladium is an important ingredient in the production of catalytic converters for automobiles produced with traditional gas engines. Hence, PALL is up 25 percent over the past month."
2015-10-05,You Might Be Crazy To Buy This ETF Or It Might Really Work,"The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is down 13.7 percent this year, making it the second-worst performer among the nine sector SPDRs. The Market Vectors-Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL), Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) and the Market Vectors Steel (ETF) (NYSE: SLX) are lower by 44.5 percent, 21.2 percent and 36.4 percent, respectively. With those data points in mind, it might seem like a death wish for a trading account to become involved with a metals and mining ETF of any type, let alone one that is heavy on gold miners, coal miners and steel producers. Mr. Market seems to believe as much, as the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME) has shed 43.2 percent this year. XME's woes are easily explained. The ETF allocates nearly 48 percent of its weight to steel stocks, and as if that is not bad enough, the fund devotes a combined 17.6 percent of its weight to coal and gold miners. Related Link: ETF Week Ahead Preview: Proving Them Right or Wrong Again, it might be crazy to get involved with an ETF like XME even at that 43 percent tumble, but some traders apparently see upside in the moribund fund as evidence by some unusual upside call buying in the fund last week. Crazy, Or Financially Savvy? On Thursday, “We saw action in infrequently traded XME (SPDR S&P Metals & Mining, Expense Ratio 0.35 percent) options, consisting of January 20 calls trading more than 20,000 times. Given XME’s $16 handle at the moment these options are more than 16 pecent out-of-the-money, but then again XME had a $20 handle just one month ago in the beginning of September before falling to current levels,” said Street One Financial Vice President Paul Weisbruch in a recent note. For one day at least, XME bulls looked smart as the ETF surged 4.6 percent last Friday, a day after that unusual call buying was spotted. As contrarian trade, XME merits consideration by the trader that believes in the mantra of be greedy when others are fearful. If old investing maxims are not one's cup of tea, one should consider the fact that relative to its recent track record, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF is starting to look pretty good. The largest gold miners' ETF jumped more than 8 percent last Friday and now resides above its 20- and 50-day moving averages. Improvements in GDX are important to XME because, as noted earlier, the latter devotes 10.3 percent of its weight to gold miners. Additionally, silver and other precious metals miners combine for almost another 13 percent of XME's lineup and four precious metals miners are found among XME's top 10 holdings. Looking Ahead Following Friday's close at $17.33, XME would need to gain 15.4 percent by January options expiry to bring the aforementioned calls to a point where profitability can be discussed. Given XME's penchant for volatility, it is possible these options could be winners. The S&P Metals and Mining Select Industry Index, XME's underlying index, has a five-year standard deviation of 35.45 percent compared to 15.15 percent for the S&P 1500, according to Standard & Poor's data.

2015-10-07,Overweight A Struggling Energy ETF? One Research Firm Says Yes,"Down 13.3 percent year-to-date, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) is the worst performer among the nine sector SPDRs and that dubious battle is not all that close as the second-worst member of that group, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), is off 10.3 percent. XLE's doldrums have not stopped investors from pouring into the fund, nor has the largest equity-based energy exchange traded fund's lethargy prevented some analysts from being bullish on the fund. In a note out Tuesday, AltaVista Research reiterated an Overweight rating on XLE. ETFs earning that rating from AltaVista show “above average appreciation potential. A rating of OVERWEIGHT is assigned to funds with ALTAR Scores above 8.0% but less than 11%. Typically, funds in this category consist of stocks trading at attractive valuations and/or having above-average fundamentals,” according to the research firm. With an ALTAR score of 9.3 percent, XLE is the only one of the nine SPDRs with a score above 8 percent. However, neither XLE's ALTAR score nor weak oil prices nor the energy's sector laggard status mean XLE is inexpensive on valuation. In fact, even when accounting for slumping oil prices, the energy sector is richly valued relative to the broader market. Related Link: The Cybersecurity ETF Long-Term View Is Bright The energy sector is expected to post an earnings contraction of almost 60 percent this year, but XLE's estimated 2015 price-to-earnings ratio is 25.5 compared to 16.3 for the S&P 500, according to AltaVista data. Only the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY) and the Consumer Staples Select SPDR (NYSE: XLP) also have estimated 2015 P/E ratios of close to 20. These less-than-positive factors have not prevented investors from adding $2.2 billion in new assets to XLE this year. Said differently, XLY and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV), the only two sector SPDRs with positive year-to-date showings, have taken in just over $2.2 billion combined. In fact, XLE's shares outstanding tally has surged 60 percent over the past 12 months, according to AltaVista data. Interestingly, XLE is not the object of short sellers' desires it was earlier this year. Twenty-six percent of XLE's shares outstanding are sold short, a percentage surpassed by four of the other sector SPDR ETFs. “Profit expectations are falling again after they appeared to stabilize in recent months, and EPS are now forecast down by more than half. On such depressed earnings the P/E ratio naturally appears elevated, but stocks in the sector look attractive on other valuation metrics like P/BV especially if the lousy Return on Equity figures forecast for this year and next is temporary, rather than a 'new normal' reflecting abundant new supplies from shale,” said AltaVista. Add to that, historical data suggest XLE makes for the ideal sector ETF should the Federal Reserve raise interest. XLE was the best of the nine SPDRs during the Fed's 2004 to 2006 tightening cycle and energy stocks displayed similar bullishness during previous tightening cycles."
2015-11-02,ETF Week Ahead Preview: Hoping For No November Rain,"Last week was an eventful one, but one that did produce big weekly moves in either direction for the major U.S. equity indexes. For October, all three major indexes posted their biggest percentage increases since October 2011, with the S&P 500 rising 8.3 percent, led by energy and materials, Reuters reported. Translation: The Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) finished October with monthly gains of 10.9 percent and 12.2 percent, respectively. Let that sink for a minute because for as impressive as those showings were for XLE and XLB, those ETFs are still 10.4 percent year-to-date, making them two of the worst-performing sector SPDR ETFs. XLE is the worst with a 2015 loss of 14.1 percent. Consumer Discretionary? Keeping with the theme of sector funds, as prosaic as it sounds, the time could be right for the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLY). Classic seasonal trends could bolster what is already this year's top-performing member of the SPDR suite. As noted on Friday, XLY is home to several of this year's best-performing Dow stocks. Related Link: High Hopes For Facebook, Disney Earnings This Week Insurance It feels like earnings season is winding down, but one look at next week's earnings calendar proves otherwise. Some other sector funds will take their turns in the earnings limelight in the week ahead. The iShares U.S. Insurance ETF (NYSE: IAK) is not a bad place to start as a fair amount of insurance providers step into the earnings confessional. Additionally, IAK is worth monitoring because insurance companies are sensitive to interest rates, in a positive way, so if Treasury yields climb, so should this ETF. Oil& Gas Fresh off an October gain of 11.4 percent, the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (NYSE: XOP) will also see some earnings tests in the week ahead. Hint: Those reports are likely to reveal a lot of cost-cutting and downbeat commentary about the current state of the energy sector. The good news is, markets have priced most of that in. The iShares U.S. Pharmaceuticals ETF (NYSE: IHE) might be worth watching for the duration of November as Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Allergan Plc (NYSE: AGN) work towards a marriage. As Benzinga noted last week, IHE has one of the largest combined weights to those two stocks of any ETF. Media reports out Friday indicate the two companies want to finalize a deal by Thanksgiving. Here's a fun fact that could reveal some clues about the level of risk appetite currently being displayed by investors while potentially also revealing clues about what to expect in the coming weeks: Of last week's 20 top-performing non-leveraged ETFs, 19 either energy, healthcare or Internet funds and all of those funds were up at least 2.9 percent on the week."
2015-11-02,Sector ETFs For November: Time For Laggards To Lead,"Year-to-date, five of the nine sector SPDR exchange-traded funds issued by State Street Global Advisors (SSgA) have traded lower. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE) is the most egregious offender of the lot with a 12.2 percent year-to-date loss. Perhaps the Utilities SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLU) and its nearly 5 percent decline deserve a pass due to all the debate over interest rates. For some of the other sector laggards, the time could be right to turn the tables and finish 2015 on a strong note. Sometimes, a change of the calendar helps. Seasonal factors work best when combined with other, more scientific trading approaches, but it is worth noting that the two sector SPDRs that typically perform the best in November are highly cyclical funds. They are also of the two of this year's five laggards. Related Link: A Leading Sector ETF For November Materials ETF Start with the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), which according to CXO Advisory data, is historically the best-performing SPDR in November. XLB, the largest materials ETF, has posted an average November gain of nearly 3 percent since 1999, the first full trading year for the sector SPDR suite. XLB comes into November with a 5.5 percent year-to-date loss, placing it as second worst among the nine SPDRs. However, XLB may have gotten a head start on its positive seasonality by surging 13.4 percent in October. Investors should note that XLB's seasonal ebullience is not confined to November, as the ETF is also the best of the nine SPDRs in December, according to CXO. Industrials ETF The Sector Spdr Trust Sbi (NYSE: XLI) is usually the second best of the nine SPDRs in November, posting an average gain of just over 2 percent in the eleventh month of the year, according to CXO data. However, in XLI's case, the ETF did not get a head start on its favorable seasonality, as it fell by a third of a percent in October. What's Happening This Year? Here is an interesting tidbit that explains the struggles of XLB and XLI this year. Fourteen (14) of the 30 members of the Dow Jones Industrial are currently saddled with year-to-date losses. One, E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: DD), resides in XLB, while three of the other 13 are major holdings in XLB. Notable is the fact that XLI is also the second best of the SPDRs in December. And as for the sector ETFs that typically disappoint in November, the Select Sector Financial Slct Str SPDR Fd (NYSE: XLF) historically notches a negative performance, while XLU (the largest utilities ETF) is the worst of the positive performers, according to CXO.

2015-11-27,Sector ETF Ideas For December: Not What You Think,"December trading comes Tuesday and with the arrival of the 12th month comes plenty of conjecture about a Santa Claus rally and the January Effect. The arrival of December is also likely to bring speculation that this is a fine time of the year in which to be long consumer discretionary and retail stocks and the corresponding exchange traded funds. Sector investors might be surprised to learn that consumer discretionary and retail ETFs can be duds at this time of the year. Those investors might also be surprised to learn about which sector funds are, on a historical basis, potent in December. All those investors need to do is look back on which sector ETFs thrive in November for a guide as to what expect in December. Year-to-date, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), the largest materials ETF, is down 4.6 percent, which is good for the third-worst performance among the nine legacy sector SPDR ETFs. However, XLB is usually the best of those nine SPDRs in the month of December, posting an average gain of over 3 percent, according to CXO Advisory data. The data go back to 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR suite. Related Link: Small-Cap Seasonality: It's The Right Time For This ETF XLB is up a third of a percent month-to-date, which is decent, but still a betrayal of the ETF's reputation as the best sector SPDR in November. Speaking of what are usually the best sector SPDRs in November, the Industrial Select SPDR (NYSE: XLI) is, historically, the second-best of the nine in the 11th month of the year. XLI, the largest industrial ETF, is up 0.2 percent this month, and also usually repeats as the second-best SPDR in December behind XLB. XLI posts an average December gain of about 2.5 percent, according to CXO data. The ETF is down 1.3 percent year-to-date, good for the third-worst performance among the nine SPDRs behind the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) and XLB. As for the two worst SPDRs in December, those dubious distinctions belong to the, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLP) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK). However, that is a testament to the strength of U.S. equities in the final month of the year because, as CXO data confirm, XLP and XLK each historically post modest December gains. In the case of XLP, the ETF's December weakness could be telling about what to expect from the holiday shopping season because Dow component Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) are top 10 holdings in XLP."
2015-12-09,Merger Mania For Materials ETFs,"Year-to-date, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is down 7.8 percent, good for the second-worst among the nine legacy sector SPDR exchange traded funds, but XLB and rival materials ETFs could be in for some near-term relief on the back of major mergers and acquisitions news. After the close of U.S. markets Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal reported DuPont Co. (NYSE: DD) and rival Dow Chemical Co. (NYSE: DOW) are in merger talks described as advanced. DuPont and Dow Chemical are XLB's largest and second-largest holdings, respectively, combining for 23.4 percent of the $2.11 billion ETF's weight. The iShares U.S. Basic Materials ETF (NYSE: IYM) has a combined weight of 22.4 percent to the two materials giants while the Vanguard Materials ETF (NYSE: VAW) dedicated 15.7 percent of its combined weight to DuPont and Dow Chemical at the end of October. Related Link: Dow Chemical, DuPont Shares Explode After 'Mother Of All' Merger Report A combined Dow Chemical/DuPont would create a giant with more than $90 billion in combined sales and strong positions in everything from plastics to industrial chemicals and agriculture, according to WSJ.

Roughly 70 ETFs have exposure to Dow Chemical with XLB also boasting the largest exposure to the chemicals giant. Another ETF for investors keep in an eye as the Dow/DuPont marriage moves toward confirmation or a breakup is the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal-Weight Materials ETF (NYSE: RTM). DuPont and Dow Chemical are RTM's second- and fourth-largest holdings, respectively, combining for 9.4 percent of the ETF's weight, according to Guggenheim data. News of the potential Dow/DuPont marriage comes at a time of year when materials historically perform well. In fact, XLB is usually the best-performing sector SPDR in November and December.

2015-12-28,Don't Bet On An Earnings Recovery For Energy ETFs,"The Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) is the worst-performing sector SPDR this year and the battle for that dubious distinction is not even close. XLE, the largest equity-based energy exchange traded fund by assets, is down 19.8 percent, more than 2 1/2 times the year-to-date loss incurred by the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), the second-worst of the nine SPDRs. XLE is far from alone in disappointing investors. In a year in which oil futures have tumbled to multi-year lows, plenty of energy sector ETFs are sporting losses on par with XLE's. Some, such as those ETFs tracking the exploration and production and oil services, have been even worse. Gloomy Year? Even with energy equities mired in a slump and heading for another year of lagging the S&P 500, contracting earnings mean the sector is not as inexpensive as some investors would like to believe. Energy stocks, broadly speaking, are not really cheap at all. Making matters worse on the energy earnings front is that the analysts tracking the sector are paring estimates for next year, forecasting another potentially gloomy year of earnings growth for the S&P 500's seventh-largest sector weight. As the price of oil has fallen, analysts have also lowered earnings estimates for companies in the S&P 500 Energy sector for the fourth quarter. The aggregate earnings estimate for the S&P 500 Energy sector for the fourth quarter has declined by 15% since September 30 (to $7.5 billion from $8.9 billion), according to a recent FactSet note. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX), two of the worst-performing members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year. That is just one less-than-encouraging anecdote, but it speaks to the fact that analysts are far from enthused by the energy sector's earnings prospects for 2016. Revisions It appears analysts are pessimistic on earnings for the Energy sector for 2016 as well, based on revisions to earnings estimates. The aggregate earnings estimate for the Energy sector for 2016 has also fallen by 15% since September 30 (to $42.9 billion from $50.7 billion). As a result, the Energy sector is now expected to report a year-over-year decline in earnings of 8% in 2016, compared to an expectation for earnings growth of 9% in earnings back on September 30, notes FactSet. As FactSet notes, 45 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 Energy Index have seen 2016 earnings estimates cut by 20 percent or more by analysts following those firms. That means energy is the only one of the 10 sectors tracked within the S&P 500 that is expected to show contracting earnings in 2016. Exxon Mobil and Chevron have suffered some of the worst negative earnings revisions with rival ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) being in that glum ballpark as well. ConocoPhillips is XLE's sixth-largest holding at a weight of almost 3.8 percent."
2016-01-12,An ETF For All Sectors,"Plenty of broad market exchange traded funds give investors to a variety of sectors, but no ETF does it quite like the ALPS Equal Weight Sector ETF (NYSE: EQL). The $128.8 million ALPS Equal Weight Sector ETF, which will celebrate its seventh anniversary in early July, uses a straight forward approach. The ALPS Equal Weight Sector ETF holds the nine sector SPDR ETFs on an equal-weight basis. Currently, weights for the nine SPDRs in EQL range from 10.7 percent for the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) to 11.7 percent for the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLU). Utilities stocks and exchange-traded funds faced plenty of challenges last year as the Federal Reserve set the stage for its first interest rate increase in nearly a decade. With the central bank poised to raise borrowing costs several times this year, investors should approach the utilities sector and its ETFs with caution. Sliding oil prices pinched materials stocks and ETFs, making XLB one of the worst-performing sector SPDRs. As ALPS notes on the EQL website, the ETF's advantages include insulating investors from rapid deterioration in one sector while allowing for participation in broader market upside. Over the past year, EQL is down 7.5 percent compared to a 4.9 percent loss for the S&P 500. Some of EQL's weakness relative to the S&P 500 can undoubtedly be attributed to the ETF's nearly 10.8 percent weight to the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE). That means EQL's energy weight is nearly 400 basis points above that of the S&P 500. In a recent note, AltaVista Research rated EQL Neutral. This indicates that valuations adequately reflect the fundamentals of stocks in these funds, said the research firm. Though it has not been confirmed, EQL could take on a different look later this year when real estate becomes its own sector on August 31. Last year, State Street introduced the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLRE) and the Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLFS) to give advisors and investors avenues for preparing for real estate becoming its own sector. The popular Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLF) will remain the same. Although equal weighting of sectors can result in faster or slower earnings growth versus the S&P500 in any single year, profitability is similar on average. However equal-weighting aims to systematically avoid the excesses of the cap-weighted benchmark (such as the Financial crisis and the Tech bubble before that) making it ideal for 'set-it-and-forget-it' investors who prefer somewhat less volatile returns, according to AltaVista."

2016-01-26,Investors Are Bottom Fishing With Energy ETFs,"The Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE), the largest equity-based exchange-traded fund tracking the energy sector, was the worst performing of the nine legacy sector SPDR ETFs in each of the past two years. Fortunately for XLE, three weeks into 2016, the ETF is avoiding that ominous fate even with a 11.9 percent year-to-date loss. Believe it or not, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) has been even worse, clocking in a 2016 loss of 14.8 percent. Oil's ongoing weakness is not chasing investors from oil ETFs. In fact, that continuing weakness is emboldening some to keep betting on an oil rebound. Related Link: An ETF For All Sectors The Oil Impact Year-to-date, investors have added nearly $464 million in new money to XLE. Among the nine SPDRs, only the Utilities SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLU) and the Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLP) have seen larger year-to-date inflows. One interesting element to XLE's inflows is that the influx of new capital to the ETF comes amid declining short interest, meaning investors are buying XLE wagering that the ETF is poised to go up. When short sellers borrow shares of an ETF to short, new shares are created, giving the impression that assets under management are rising. When those short sellers cover, the ETF's asset can decline. XLE's short interest has been steadily declining since the fourth quarter of 2014. “An analysis of the largest energy sector ETF, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund [XLE], vs. its short interest percentage indicates flows are coming from ETF purchases and not from short positioning. This typically suggests investors are positioning for a bottom in the energy sector,” said State Street Vice President David Mazza in a recent note. Earnings Improvement On The Horizon The good news for ETFs such as XLE is that although average oil price forecasts for this year are still well below the high market prices seen a couple of years ago, earnings are expected to improve. At the very least, XLE's holdings should see decreased earnings contractions this year. Dow components Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), the two largest U.S. oil companies, combine for 34 percent of XLE's weight. “The energy sector had a tough year in terms of performance with the S&P Energy Select Sector Index down about 21 percent in 2015. Despite this, energy ETFs have attracted the largest amount of inflows this year, outpacing the high growth health care and consumer discretionary sectors,” added Mazza. Image Credit: Public Domain"
2016-02-01,Two Sector ETF Ideas For February,"February is here, and with the arrival of the second month of the year comes renewed optimism that this month will bring better things to equity investors than January brought. As is the case with the arrival of each new month, sector-level opportunity also arrives; February usually brings opportunity with what may be considered some surprising sector exchange-traded funds. Is February A Good Month For Energy? February marks the start of what is, historically, the energy sector's strongest period of the year. Since 1999, the first full year of trading for State Street's sector SPDR suite, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE) has been the best-performing member of that group during the month of February. According to CXO Advisory data, XLE, the largest equity-based energy ETF by assets, averages a February return of 2 percent. Related Link: It Might Finally Be Time For Industrial ETFs XLE investors could sure use a repeat of that trend this February, as the ETF is down 3.5 percent year-to-date. That is a concerning start to the year for XLE after the ETF lost 8.7 percent in 2014 and 21.5 percent in 2015, making it the worst-performing SPDR in each of those years. Oil Weakness And Investor Reactions Oil's ongoing weakness is not chasing investors from oil ETFs. In fact, that continuing weakness is emboldening some to keep betting on an oil rebound. XLE has added over $389 million in new assets this year, good for the third-best total among the sector SPDR ETFs. Other Historical High Hitters For SPDR February's second-best SPDR, on a historical basis, is the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), which averages a second-month return of about 1.5 percent, according to CXO data. XLB investors could really use a repeat of that theme, because XLB is down nearly 11 percent to start the year, making it the worst of the nine legacy sector SPDR ETFs. Although XLB and XLE have had their share of struggle in recent years, it is worth noting that the pair are frequently featured among the various months' two best sector ETFs. For example, XLE is historically the second-best SPDR in March, April and May, according to CXO data. XLB is the best of the nine established SPDRs in November and December. Sectors That Typically Perform Less Well In February As for the sector SPDRs to avoid in February, that dubious distinction belongs to the Select Sector Financial Slct Str SPDR Fd (NYSE: XLF) and the Utilities SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLU), both of which average February losses in excess of 1 percent, according to CXO data.

2016-02-12,A Gloomy Forecast For Energy ETF Dividends,"The Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE) is down 10.7 percent year-to-date, which is obviously a poor showing, but in a sign of just how poorly stocks are performing this year, XLE is not the worst of the nine established sector SPDR ETFs. XLE is tied for third-worst with the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). While sector exchange-traded funds are performing worse than XLE, energy ETFs do face dividend issues, and those issues are not pleasant. Last year, when the energy sector was the worst performing group in the S&P 500, energy stocks accounted for the bulk of the negative dividend actions in the benchmark U.S. equity index. The energy dividend situation is off to an ominous start in 2016. The year is less than two months old and already the sector's dividend cuts and suspensions number in the dozens. Energy companies are displaying a preference for conserving cash and avoiding credit downgrades as oil prices continue tumbling. Related Link: Energy ETFs Making Noise To Start 2016 Pinching Dividends “The dismal picture is now starting to filter through to dividend policies with Markit Dividend Forecasting expecting global dividends from large oil & gas companies (above $10 billion in market cap) to decline by 9 percent to $147 billion in 2016. This adds to last year’s decline which means that dividends in 2016 are forecasted to be 22 percent off their 2014 peak,” said Markit in a recent note. ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), a top 10 holding in XLE, pared its dividend earlier this year. Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: APC), another XLE holding, recently followed suit. Last year, Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), the second-largest U.S. oil company, let a lengthy dividend increase streak lapse. By some estimates, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM)'s payout ratio could reach 100 percent this year if the largest U.S. oil company does not pare its payout. Dow components Exxon and Chevron are XLE's two largest holdings. Other ETFs could be pinched by falling energy dividends, including the iShares MSCI United Kingdom ETF (iShares Trust (NYSE: EWU)). Due to expected cuts in the energy and materials sectors, payouts among FTSE 100 companies are expected to fall this year though BP plc (ADR) (NYSE: BP) and Royal Dutch Shell plc (ADR) (NYSE: RDS-A), two major EWU holdings, have yet to announce negative dividend action. “Ratings agencies may play a part in the oil dividend conundrum as maintaining investment grade status has proven to be one of the few 'sacred cows' which oil executives have least been willing to relinquish,” said Markit.

2016-03-03,Sector ETFs For March: The Meek Shall Inherit The Month,"March is here and with the arrival of the third month of the year comes the start of what is, historically, the best two-month stretch year for stocks. That is right, the S&P 500's historical March/April performance slightly nudges the index's November/December showing. As is the case with the other 11 months of the year, some sectors and the corresponding exchange-traded funds perform better during the month than others. What is potentially interesting about sector ETFs in March 2016 is that the sector SPDR ETFs that have historically bullish March performances are among this year's worst performing sector ETFs. Related Link: This Sector ETF Is A Value Proposition Will Historical Precedents Power Through? Start with the Select Sector Financial Slct Str SPDR Fd (NYSE: XLF). The largest financial services ETF has rebounded nicely off its February low, but XLF is still down 7.5 percent year-to-date. However, March is often kind to the ETF. Since 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR suite, XLF has posted an average March gain of just over three percent. That makes XLF the best of the nine established SPDRs, according to CXO Advisory data. Adding to the near-term problems for U.S. bank stocks and ETFs like XLF is that when the sector climbed last year as investors were betting on the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, the group became expensive on valuation. Speaking of problems, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE) is usually the second-best SPDR in March, posting a third-month gain of almost 3 percent, according to CXO data. After ranking as the worst performing SPDR in each of the past two years, XLE is down just 1.4 percent this year. Energy ETFs also face dividend issues, and those issues are not pleasant. Last year, when the energy sector was the worst performing group in the S&P 500, energy stocks accounted for the bulk of the negative dividend actions in the benchmark U.S. equity index. As for the sector SPDRs to avoid this month, CXO data indicate that dubious distinction belongs to the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the Consumer Discretionary SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLY). However, “avoid” is a strong term because in a testament to how strong stocks are in March, XLY averages a gain of over 2 percent this month, while XLB's average March gain is about that much.

2016-03-04,A Fast Start And Good Timing For This New ETF,"Just eight exchange-traded funds made all-time highs Thursday, and several of those are funds that have only been around a few months. Standard advice would be to not get too excited about an ETF that is just a few months old hitting an all-time high, but the SPDR S&P North American Natural Resources ETF (NYSE: NANR) is worth examining. Still nearly two weeks shy of its three-month anniversary, NANR is easily one of the quietest success stories among the more than 280 exchange-traded products that debuted in the United States last year. The reality is the ETF industry is increasingly competitive and it is not everyday rookie funds achieve what NANR has in fewer than 90 days. That achievement is a staggering $786.5 million in assets under management. Related Link: Secrets To This ETF's Success Making NANR's success all the more remarkable is that the new allocates over 95 percent of its combined weight to the materials and energy sectors, two of last year's worst-performing groups. Going Bananas For NANR “NANR is designed to meet demand for natural resources equity exposure by providing access to companies in the energy, materials and agriculture industries. NANR provides investors with an approach that weights the sub-sectors of the portfolio 45 percent energy, 35 percent materials and 20 percent agriculture stocks,” according to a statement from State Street Global Advisors (SSgA). The SPDR S&P North American Natural Resources ETF follows the S&P BMI North American Natural Resources Index, which is a subset of the S&P Global Large MidCap Commodity and Natural Resources Index, according to SSgA. While the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), two ETFs with plenty of holdings also residing in NANR, have risen since late last year, those funds have been unable to compete with NANR. XLE and XLB are up an average of about 2 percent since NANR debuted while the resources ETF is higher by a staggering 13.2 percent. Perhaps bolstering the case for energy ETFs, such as XLE, is valuation. While the energy sector's price-to-earnings ratio is not overwhelmingly compelling by virtue of the group's contracting earnings, the sector's price-to-book ratio resides around multi-year lows. XLE and XLB holdings that are also found in NANR include Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON). NANR holds 61 stocks with a weighted average market value of $63.7 billion. Image Credit: Public Domain"

2016-03-16,High-Yield Bond ETFs Are Hot Again,"The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLE) are up 1.8 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, year-to-date. While those gains are not jaw-dropping, they are enough to put those once moribund sectors in rebound territory. Rebounding and energy materials names are one thing. Comebacks for those credits is a different story and that story is being played with investors' renewed enthusiasm for high-yield corporate bond exchange traded funds, such as the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSE: HYG) and the SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (NYSE: JNK). Previously, the energy and materials sectors were drains on HYG and JNK, the two largest junk bond ETFs, other high-yield corporates ETFs. Amid a spate of energy issuer defaults and downbeat performances by CCC-rated issues, HYG and JNK were pressured last year. Compounding that problem was the fact that there is plenty of supply in the high-yield market from energy and materials issuers. But 2016 is a new year and investors are once again embracing junk bond ETFs. “Investors have been keen to take advantage of the improving macroeconomic backdrop by taking on risk through HY ETFs, due to their relative liquidity and ease to access. The last five weeks have seen consecutive inflows totalling $6.1bn, reminiscent of the inflows seen last October as global credit markets rallied on diminishing fears over a China/emerging markets slowdown,” said Markit in a new note. Year-to-date, HYG and JNK have added $1.58 billion and $2 billion, respectively, in new assets. JNK's haul puts it among the top 10 asset-gathering ETFs this year. The energy rally is helping. HYG devotes just over 10 percent of its weight to bonds hailing from that sector. In what could be seen as good news, in a strange world, the dollar amount of energy and materials junk bonds floating around today is off its highs. According to Markit’s iBoxx indices, the sector leading the recent rally in US HY bonds has been Oil & Gas, which has seen spreads fall 547bps since February 11th. This comes as no surprise given crude oil’s rebound, but spreads remain above 1,000bps, indicating distressed levels. Basic Materials has seen a 388bps tightening and average spreads are back below 1,000bps. While these two sectors have led the tightening in absolute terms, both represent around a fall in spreads by around a third, similar to the Utilities and Financials sectors, implying a broad based tightening,” adds Markit."
2016-05-02,Best (And Worst) Sector ETFs For May,"Welcome to May. The fifth month of the year historically marks the beginning of the weakest six-month period for stocks.

2016-06-14,Material Girls: Materials ETFs Look For More Upside,"The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB), the largest diversified exchange-traded fund tracking the materials sector, is up 9.1 percent year-to-date. XLB's 2016 is impressive not only because it puts the fund in third place among the sector SPDR ETFs, but also because XLB sagged 8.7 percent last year. XLB has been buoyed not only by rebounding commodities prices, but also by mergers and acquisitions activity. For example, Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON), XLB's third-largest holding, is the target of a takeover by Germany's Bayer AG (ADR) (OTC: BAYRY), while Dow Chemical Co (NYSE: DOW) and E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: DD) are merging to become one of the largest chemicals makers in the world. Those three stocks combine for nearly a third of XLB's weight. Materials Are Hot Investors are acknowledging strength in the materials sector, as are analysts. “Investors piled into materials equity ETFs in May, with the $1.8 billion for the sector exceeding the net inflows of all other GICS sectors according to SSGA data. Though the materials sector of the S&P 500 has already been a bright spot in 2016, rising 9.3 percent year to date through June 10, S&P Global Market Intelligence thinks there's room for additional growth,” said S&P Capital IQ in a note out Monday. Related Link: Maybe Some Relief For The Spain ETF The research firm is bullish on the materials sector, noting that of the 26 materials stocks in the S&P 500, S&P Capital IQ has buy or strong buy ratings on 18. XLB is home to 26 stocks. Looking For More Upside Although the materials sector is one of the smallest sector allocations in the S&P 500, there is competition in this corner of the ETF space. For example, XLB and other cap-weighted materials ETFs are facing rising competition from smart beta materials ETFs. The John Hancock Multifactor Materials ETF (NYSE: JHMA) is part of that group. “Unlike its market-cap weighted peers, JHMA emphasizes smaller cap companies with relatively low valuations and high profitability. International Paper Co (NYSE: IP) and LyondelBassell Industries NV (NYSE: LYB) were heftier positions in JHMA than in XLB and FMAT. JHMA has a 0.50 percent expense ratio and has a wider bid/ask spread than its peers,” added S&P Capital IQ. JHMA debuted in late March and now has $5.3 million in assets under management. Although it employs a smart beta strategy, JHMA's valuation is slightly below that of XLB plus the Hancock ETF features a larger roster at 35 stocks. However, JHMA charges 0.5 percent per year compared to 0.14 percent charged by XLB."
2016-06-15,What Sector ETFs Are Saying,"A simplistic view would be to say the Utilities SPDR ETF (NYSE: XLU) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE) are impressing this year. So is the Materials Select Sector SDPR (NYSE: XLB). Beyond that, there is not a lot to brag about among the major sector exchange-traded funds. The Sector ETF Story Of course, there is more to the sector ETF story. Amid heightened market volatility, investors have largely favored lower beta sectors such as utilities and consumer staples while the Federal Reserve's refusal to raise interest rates to this point in the year was previously a drag on the financial services, the second-largest sector weight in the S&P 500. More recently, once lagging financial services stocks and exchange-traded funds have recently sprung to life amid speculation the Federal Reserve is nearing its first interest rate increase of 2016, perhaps as soon as next month. Related Link: Add Some Pep To Utilities Allocations With This ETF Pay Attention To Shifts There are important shifts among sector ETFs currently at work investors should take note of. Investors are starting to show a preference for momentum names. “Take, for example, the consumer discretionary sector. As the chart above shows, it is trading very close to its 10-year high. But consumer discretionary is one of only two sectors, the other being health care, that reported positive earnings growth for the first quarter. Both sectors are also projected to post positive earnings growth for the full-year,” said State Street Vice President David Mazza in a recent note. Conversely, energy and financial services are the only sectors trading below their 10-year average valuations. In the case of energy, that does not necessarily mean the sector is inexpensive because contracting earnings are a main reason why valuations in the group are declining. Adding a little something to the case for financials is that the sector is expected to post positive EPS growth this year. Utilities, as has been widely, are richly valued relative an array of long-term averages, but with interest rates still low, investors continue embracing the sector. “Investors appear willing to pay up for sectors that have performed well, but they are not willing to do so for sectors like financials and energy, where there is a great deal of uncertainty around their future earnings stream. This might remain the case until investors get more clarity on future interest rates hikes and the outlook for the US economy from the Fed,” added Mazza."

2016-07-07,A Rare Bearish Call On A High-Flying Staples ETF,"Among the nine original sector SPDR exchange-traded funds, only two can top the Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLP) on a year-to-date basis. XLP, the largest consumer staples ETF by assets, is up more than 10 percent year-to-date. That is just one data point, but it underscores just how difficult it has been to bet against the staples sector in a year in which investors are heavily defensive, lower beta sectors. Several of XLP's 38 holdings hit 52-week highs on Wednesday, perhaps indicating now is not the time to be bearish on staples stocks. The Scope On Staples However, some analysts are not enthusiastic about XLP at the moment. In a recent note, AltaVista Research dinged XLP with an underweight rating, implying below average appreciation potential for the staples ETF. “Typically, funds in this category consist of stocks trading at relatively expensive valuations and/or having below-average fundamentals,” said AltaVista. Related Link: Mark Sebastian's Options Insight: How To Play The Consumer Staples ETF With staples fundamentals, broadly speaking, still sturdy, valuation is the concern here. AltaVista's 2016 estimated price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is 17.9. For XLP, the research firm estimates the staples ETF's P/E to be 22.3, meaning only two of the other 10 sector SPDR ETFs trader at higher multiples than XLP based on AltaVista estimates. Whether it is as a hedge against long positions in XLP components or outright bearish bets on the ETF itself, XLP is home to elevated short interest. As a percentage of shares outstanding, XLP's short interest is 30 percent, according to AltaVista data. Among the sector SPDR ETFs, only the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) has a higher percentage of its shares outstanding sold short. “Estimates for next year look aggressive to us, especially with commodity prices now reflating somewhat, which in turn would likely put these firms' margins under pressure. In any case Consumer Staples stocks have seen their valuation multiples expand considerably over the last five years and as a result these stocks appear rather expensive, leading to an UNDERWEIGHT recommendation,” added AltaVista."

2016-07-29,Best Sector ETFs For August: Boring Could Be Beautiful,"Today is the last trading day of July, marking a good time for traders to start setting the table for August. The eighth month of the year may bring hot temperatures outside, but on Wall Street, historical data suggest August is ice cold. Historical Performances Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 averages an August loss of 1.2 percent. On average, that is by far the worst monthly performance for the benchmark U.S. equity index, according to EquityClock.com. That does not sound encouraging, but tactical investors can find better opportunities at the sector level. Although past performance is not indicative of future returns, history has a funny way of repeating itself in financial markets. So, with that in mind, it is not surprising that best sector exchange-traded funds for August are part of the boring is beautiful theme. Boring Is Beautiful Of the nine original sector SPDR ETFs, not many average positive returns in August, but the leader of that group is also this year's top performer: Utilities SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLU). Dating back to 1999, XLU has averaged an August gain of less than 1 percent, according to CXO Advisory. Related Link: This Seasonal ETF Is Ripe For The Pickin' This Summer In June, August and September, XLU is the best-performing SPDR on a historical basis, but the ETF is also one of the two worst sector SPDRs in July. However, XLU rebuffed that reputation this month and enters July's last trading day with a month-to-date gain of about 1 percent. Keeping with the low beta, defensive theme in August, the Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLP) is August's second-best SPDR, averaging a modest gain dating back to 1999, the first full year of trading for the original sector SPDRs. XLP is also the second-best SPDR in September and ranks as one of the two best SPDRs in four different months, according to CXO Advisory. Watch Out For These Guys As for the sector ETFs to avoid this month, history says, and it is not surprising, it is cyclical sectors. The Consumer Discretionary SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLY) averages a modest August loss, making it the second-worst sector SPDR, on average, dating back to 1999. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) averages a loss of half a percent in August, a month that marks the start of a rough two-month stretch for the largest materials ETF. In September, XLB is also the worst of the original sector SPDR, posting an average loss of about three percent, according to CXO data.

2016-08-31,A Marvelous Materials ETF,"Somewhat quietly, the materials sector is enjoying a very solid year. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is up 15.2 percent, putting the largest materials exchange-traded fund in the upper echelon of the sector SPDR ETFs. Although the materials sector is one of the smallest sector allocations in the S&P 500, there is competition in this corner of the ETF space. For example, XLB and other cap-weighted materials ETFs are facing rising competition from smart beta materials ETFs. The First Trust Materials AlphaDEX Fnd (ETF) (NYSE: FXZ) is one of the largest, most seasoned members of the smart beta materials ETF club. FXZ Up 19.4 percent year-to-date, FXZ was one of 13 ETFs to hit all-time highs Tuesday. Like the other AlphaDEX ETFs, FXZ focuses on “growth factors including three, six and 12-month price appreciation, sales to price and one year sales growth, and, separately, on value factors including book value to price, cash flow to price and return on assets,” according to First Trust. Related Link: Tech's Rise Good For EM ETFs; Here's A Better Idea The $324.6 million FXZ is home to 51 stocks. Nearly 37.6 percent of the ETF's holdings are chemicals makers while another 17.4 percent are container and packaging companies. Mining and metals firms are FXZ's third-largest industry weight at 12.6 percent. Although no individual holding commands a weight of more than 3.7 percent in FXZ's lineup, the ETF has some exposure to some of the “sub-themes” that have been boosting the materials sector this year. In recent days, that has included mergers and acquisitions activity among fertilizer makers. Over the course of this year, steelmakers have been important drivers of the materials sector's bullishness and FXZ is levered to that theme as well. The Bottom Line On Materials Commodities are seen as sensitive to U.S. interest rates, but the materials sector is not as inversely correlated to rates as, say, telcom or utilities. As a cyclical sector, materials can actually perform well if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates because that would be a sign the Fed is confident the economy is strong enough to endure higher borrowing costs. “Commodities — and notably industrial metals and energy, which are the most growth-sensitive subsectors — did particularly well, with an average gain of more than 25 percent,” during previous tightening cycles, reported Mining.com, citing Allianz research.

2016-09-01,Best Sector ETFs For September: History May Not Repeat,"One perception of September is it marks the start of autumn. In financial markets, that does not necessarily mean the return of risk appetite. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 has averaged a September loss of 0.3 percent. Keeping with the theme of needing to wait a little while longer before risk appetite returns, at least at the sector, are historical data points highlighting the sector exchange-traded funds that usually perform well in September. Related Link: Get Ready For September's Jam-Packed Month As is the case with August, the best members of the sector SPDR ETF suite in September, dating back to their first full year of trading in 1999, are low beta, defensive plays including the Utilities SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLU). Utilizing Those Utility And Staples Stocks, ETFs In fact, XLU is the best-performing SPDR in September, averaging a gain of just over half a percent in the ninth month of the year, according to CXO Advisory data. September is one of three months in which XLU is one of the two best sector SPDRs. Importantly, September is also the last month in that series of three for XLU. And as is the case with August, the second-best sector SPDR ETF in September is the Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLP). Underscoring the point that September can be a tricky month for equities is the fact that XLP averages a small loss in the ninth month of the year, according to CXO data. Past Is Not Indicative Of Future Performance Well, as is always said in financial markets, past performance is no guarantee of future returns, and that could be especially true of XLP and XLU this September. XLU has spent much of this year as the best-performing sector SPDR, but recently ceded that honor to the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE). Related Link: A Historical Look At The U.S. Development From Emerging Market To Global Economic Superpower Amid increasing concerns that the defensive traded is overcrowded and overvalued, XLU and XLP have recently been bleeding assets. If the August jobs report due out Thursday is strong, giving the Federal Reserve room to soon raise interest rates, XLU and XLP could very well be on their way to defying their historical September trends — and not in a good way. The Technology SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLK) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) are usually the two worst sector SPDRs in September, but a move away from defensive names to cyclical fare, particularly against the backdrop of an imminent rate hike, could lift those ETFs this month.

2016-11-01,Best Sector ETFs For November: Let's Get Cyclical,"November is here, and if the eleventh month of the year lives up to its historical reputation, equity market bulls should be pleased. Over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has posted an average November gain of 1.7 percent, making the second-best month of the year for stocks, behind April and October, which are tied for first place. Over those 20 years, the S&P 500's November win rate is 75 percent, tying it with April for the best S&P 500 winning percentage over that time period. As is the case with the other 11 months of the year, some sectors lead in November while others lag. Leading up to November, defensive, low beta sectors are often in style. That changed this year, thanks to speculation regarding the Federal Reserve potentially raising interest rates in December. Historically, XLB Is November's Best Performer Higher interest rates can benefit cyclical sectors, and as luck would have it, some exchange-traded funds tracking cyclical sectors are among the best performing sector ETFs in November. Going back to 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR ETFs, the best performer in November is the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). XLB, the largest materials ETF by assets, posts an average November gain of nearly 3 percent, according to CXO Advisory data. XLB has been a solid performer among the sector SPDR ETFs this year, returning 9.1 percent, an advantage of 320 basis points over the S&P 500. Dow Chemical Co (NYSE: DOW) and Dow component E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: DD) combine for about 23 percent of XLB's weight. Other Cyclical Sectors Set To Succeed Keeping with the theme of cyclical sectors performing well in November, CXO data reveal that, on a historical basis, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLI) is the second-best performer among the sector SPDRs this month with an average November gain of just over 2 percent. XLI, the largest industrial ETF, is home to such storied companies as Dow components General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), 3M Co (NYSE: MMM) and Boeing Co (NYSE: BA). XLI has impressed this year as well with a 9.7 percent gain. Worst Performers Still, investors should be mindful of the fact that the cyclical theme in November is not a free lunch. The two worst-performing members of the SPDR suite this month are track cyclical sectors. According to CXO data, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLF) averages a modest November loss while the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE), this year's best-performing sector SPDR, ekes out a hardly noticeable November gain, on average.

2016-11-07,How To Play The Stock Market Following A Presidential Election,"With Election Day now just one day away, the question on every investor’s mind is which stocks will be on the move following the election and what direction will they be headed. The good news for diversified, long-term investors in equity ETFs like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) is that historically, stocks perform just fine regardless of who is president. Since Republican Dwight Eisenhower was elected in 1952, there have been 18 presidential terms of office. During 15 of those 18 terms, the S&P 500 delivered gains, the largest of which was the 84.5 percent gain during President Barack Obama’s first term in office. The only three times the S&P 500 has delivered negative gains for an entire presidential term were the infamous second term of President Nixon (-31.9 percent) and both terms of President George W. Bush (-12.4 percent, -31.5 percent). Democratic presidents are a perfect eight for eight when it comes to the stock market. The S&P 500 has risen during all eight Democratic presidential terms since 1952 for an average gain of 45.9 percent per term. Republican presidents haven’t done quite so well for investors. The S&P 500 has risen during seven out of the 10 Republican terms in office for an average gain of 22.1 percent. “The saying that Republican Presidents are better than Democrats for investors continues to be one of the bigger misconceptions there is in the investment world,” Bespoke analysts said in the firm’s 2016 market outlook report. By looking at the last two terms under a Republican president (George W. Bush) and a Democratic president (Barack Obama), traders can get a bit of an idea of which sectors have performed best under each party. From 2001 to 2008, under Bush’s leadership, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE) (+43.6 percent) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) (+8.2 percent) were the two best-performing SPDR sector ETFs. The Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLF) (-56.1 percent) and The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLI) (-21.5 percent) were the two worst-performing sectors. Under President Obama, every single sector ETF is up at least 37.3 percent. The two top performers have been the Consumer Discretionary SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLY) (+243.9 percent) and the Technology SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLK) (+193.1 percent). The two worse-performing sector ETFs have been the XLE (+37.3 percent) and the Utilities SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLU) (+61.1 percent)."
2016-11-30,Best Sector ETFs for December: A Repeat Offender,"December arrives Thursday, and with it comes visions of a Santa Claus rally on Wall Street. While it remains to be seen whether Santa delivers for investors this year, December's reputation as a good month for equities is well-deserved. Over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has posted an average December gain of 1.3 percent, making the 12th month of the year the fifth best in terms of performance for the benchmark U.S. equity index, according to EquityClock.com. Over those 20 years, the S&P 500 has finished higher in December by 70 percent, a win rate topped by just two other months — April and November. As is the case with the other 11 months, December brings sector-level opportunity, a theme highly suitable for exchange-traded funds. In fact, one of December's best-performing sector ETFs is a fund that also has a knack for delivering solid November gains. That ETF is the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB). Santa's Materials Since 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR suite, XLB has been the best-performing member of that group in December, with an average gain of nearly 3 percent, according to CXO Advisory data. That after November, a month in which XLB is also, historically, the best-performing sector SPDR. December is one of three months in which XLB, the largest materials ETF by assets, is either the best or second-best sector SPDR ETF. Year-to-date, XLB is the third-best SPDR, trailing only its energy and industrial counterparts. Now things get interesting because, according to CXO data, the Health Care SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLV) is usually the second-best SPDR in December. Interesting because with a 2.5 percent year-to-date loss, XLV is easily one of the worst-performing members of the sector SPDR lineup in 2016. XLV usually posts a December gain of just over 2 percent. If history repeats, that would go a long way toward helping the widely followed healthcare ETF at least finish the year flat. On The Naughty List As for the sector SPDR ETFs to avoid in December, none average negative returns in the last month of the year, but the Technology SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLK) only manages modest December upside, according to CXO data. That is to say XLK is the worst-performing sector SPDR in December. The Consumer Staples Select Sect. SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLP) is, historically, the second-worst sector SPDR in December, but that situation could worsen this year if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates in December. That move is likely to pressure, as speculation to that effect already has, rate-sensitive staples stocks and ETFs."
2016-11-30,Materials Mavens: Sector ETFs To Embrace,"Underscoring this year's renaissance in cyclical sectors, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is up more than 15 percent, a showing that is good for third among the sector SPDR exchange-traded funds. The two SPDRs outpacing XLB this year are cyclical funds, those tracking the energy and industrial sectors. Commodities And Materials Commodities are seen as sensitive to U.S. interest rates, but the materials sector is not as inversely correlated to rates as, say, telecom or utilities. As a cyclical sector, materials can actually perform well if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates because that would be a sign the Fed is confident the economy is strong enough to endure higher borrowing costs. Some analysts are increasingly bullish on the materials sector. “CFRA’s Investment Policy Committee raised its weighting on the materials sector to Overweight from Marketweight last week. Sam Stovall, CFRA’s Chief Investment Strategist, noted that we project this mid-to-late economic cycle outperformer to record above-market EPS growth in 2017, assisted by a recovery in commodity prices from their drawn-out decline. He also thinks the group will benefit from the expected pickup in U.S. infrastructure spending under the new Republican administration,” said CFRA Research in a note out Tuesday. XLB is home to $3.57 billion in assets under management, making it the largest materials ETF on the market. The fund holds 28 stocks, but its lineup is top heavy as Dow component E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE: DD), Dow Chemical Co (NYSE: DOW) and agribusiness giant Monsanto Company (NYSE: MON) combine for nearly 31 percent of the ETF's weight. Chemicals Sub-Industry Chemicals makers represent over 71 percent of XLB's weight, which could be a positive going forward. “Christopher Muir, a CFRA equity analyst, has a positive fundamental outlook for the diversified chemicals sub-industry, the largest in the S&P 500 materials sector. Muir believes that the business environment for the chemical industry will remain healthy and that the chemical manufacturing sector will continue to expand. Equity analyst Matt Miller raised his fundamental outlook to positive on the steel industry in November in part due to Trump’s discussion in the campaign to significantly increasing tariffs on imported steel from China,” said CFRA. The SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (ETF) (NYSE: XME), which has more than doubled in value this year, allocates over 58 percent of its weight to steel stocks. Previously high-flying precious metals miners are 15 percent of XME's lineup. CFRA has a Market-Weight rating on XME and an Overweight rating on XLB."
2016-12-19,Meet This Year's Best Materials ETF,"The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) is up 17.7 percent, a performance that's good for one of the better showings among the widely followed sector SPDR exchange traded funds and one that underscores the strength in the materials sector. However, XLB and comparable materials ETFs aren't close to being the best materials ETF in 2016. That honor goes to the PureFunds ISE Junior Silver ETF (NYSE: SILJ), which is an impressive factoid considering the recent, stunning retrenchment experienced by precious metals miners equities and ETFs. Year In Review With a year-to-date gain of just over 132 percent, SILJ remains one of 2016's best-performing non-leveraged ETFs. On its own, that's an accomplishment, but that accomplishment is particularly notable and possibly concerning when considering SILJ has tumbled 25.5 percent in the fourth quarter and resides 40.5 percent below its 52-week high reached in August. SILJ's underlying index “is designed to reflect the performance of small-capitalization companies involved in the silver industry, including companies that mine, explore and refine silver. The stocks are screened for liquidity and weighted according to modified free-float market capitalization. The Index generally is comprised of 20-30 securities,” according to PureFunds. More Demand Demand trends also bode well for SILJ and its holdings. The U.S. Mint is currently boosting production of silver coins due to increased investor demand and industries, such as healthcare and technology, are expected to more than triple nanosilver demand over the next seven years. As has been the case with its gold mining brethren, SILJ has been challenged by the rising U.S. dollar, a scenario that could extend into 2017 if the Federal Reserve makes good on its pledge to boost interest rates as many as three times. It's not a coincidence that SILJ is lower by 9.5 percent over the past month while the U.S. Dollar Index is higher by 2.5 percent over the same stretch. However, catalysts remain for precious metals such as slack earnings growth in the US and low and negative yields on sovereign debt throughout the developed world. Said another way, even a couple of rate hikes here in the United States would not be long-term damaging to gold and silver. Rising inflation and silver's low correlation to other assets, such as stocks and bonds, could be other catalysts for the white metal and SILJ in 2017, but the biggest boost for the ETF would likely come by way of dollar retrenchment."
2017-01-03,Best Sector ETFs For January: Trying To Get Healthy,"The first month of the new year is here and with that come hopes one of the longest bull markets in U.S. history will keep going. Historically, January isn't a great month for stocks. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 has notched an average January loss of a tenth of a percent while finishing higher in just 55 percent of those Januarys, according to EquityClock.com. January is one of five months to average a negative performance over the past two decades, but it's tied with February for “best of the worst” honors. Of course, there are sector-level opportunities to consider this month and one such opportunity is a bet on 2016's worst-performing sector. Healthcare (XLV) The Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLV), the largest healthcare exchange traded fund by assets, is usually the best-performing member of the sector SPDR ETF suite in January, according to CXO Advisory data. XLV has some work to do to live up to its historical precedent. Healthcare, the third-largest sector weight in the S&P 500, was the only sector to lose ground last year. That means XLV finished lower by 2.8 percent in 2016, its first annual loss in eight years. Since 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR suite, XLV has averaged a January of about 1.5 percent. XLV gained 1.5 percent in December, the month in which the ETF is usually the second-best member of the SPDR suite. Technology (XLK) Coming off a 2016 gain, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLK) is usually the second-best SPDR ETF in January behind XLV. However, XLK's average January gain is just about half a percent, according to CXO data. Last year, investors added about $99.5 million to XLV while pulling nearly $324 million from XLK, the largest technology ETF. Industrials (XLI On a historical basis, the two worst-performing sector SPDRs in January are two of 2016 best performers. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) and the Industrial Select SPDR (NYSE: XLI) each average losses of about 2 percent in the first month of the year, according to CXO data. XLI and XLB returned 20 percent and 16.8 percent, respectively, last year. The near-term market environment favors industrials. Industrials are a cyclical group, and cyclicals historically outperform in the latter stages of the business cycle. Additionally, cyclical groups have historically been durable in the face of rising interest rates. With the possibility of the Federal Reserve boosting rates three times this year, industrials make for an ideal sector bet."
2017-01-11,"Freeport-McMoRan, Martin Marietta And Steel's Strength In The Trump Rally","The Trump rally has benefited certain sectors more than others. One of the strongest sectors that benefited is materials and metals stocks. CNBC's Dominic Chu explained that it's widely believed materials and metals stocks will benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's administration given his plans to invest $1 trillion in infrastructure projects over the coming years. The strong investor sentiment is most apparent in the exchange traded fund which trackers the materials sector, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE: XLB) which is higher by more than 25 percent over the past year. In fact, among the 25 members of the S&P 500 materials sector, nine of the stocks have rallied to the point where it's trading at least 10 percent above its 200-day average trading price. Among the notables in Chu's list, the major gravel, stone and sand provider Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) is trading 15 percent above its 200-day moving average. In addition, steel company Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) is trading around 17 percent above its 200-day moving average. However, these returns are overshadowed by Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX) which is trading at the biggest premium in its group to the 200-day average at 31 percent."
2017-01-12,Affordable Housing Crisis Continues To Weigh On American Middle Class,"The middle class is increasingly being squeezed out of the major metropolitan areas in the United States. President-elect Donald Trump's administration and recent appointment of Ben Carson to the Department of Housing and Urban Development have done little convince Americans the trend will change anytime soon. Despite U.S. household incomes hitting their highest rate since the Census Bureau began releasing this information six decades ago, incomes aren’t rising as fast as rents are in the big cities. As costs continue to outpace incomes, a bigger group of lower income renters have emerged, and they are chasing a shrinking rental pool of housing. Americans continue to see the after-effects of the Great Recession nearly a decade removed in the form of an affordable housing crisis. Housing Affordability Remains Paramount According to a study by the MacArthur Foundation, 81 percent of Americans continue to believe housing affordability is a problem in America today. New developments being built in the major metropolitan areas are generally not affordable for the working class, and affordable housing is often relegated to the rural outskirts of a city. The crisis doesn’t just effect the lower socio-economic classes either, “A family that makes $100,000 can’t afford to buy a house in most US cities,” lawyer Mechele Dickerson, an expert in housing and the middle class, was quoted as saying in a Wired article. “We are not producing enough supply of affordable housing. Developers can’t make the economics work on new developments to make it affordable for the lower socioeconomic class,” Amerisouth Realty CEO Ruel Hamilton, who specializes in affordable apartment development in the inner city, told Benzinga. “More incentives are needed to maintain existing infrastructure that falls under affordable housing. The way programs are administered right now essentially ensures that 90 percent of the money will go to rural areas; it is not being built in the areas that it is needed,” Hamilton added. Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed the issue last year as he met with several housing experts to learn about the country’s affordable housing crisis. In major metropolitan areas, it is companies like Facebook that have played a major role in exorbitant housing costs that are making cities like San Francisco out of reach for the average renter. An estimated 12 million Americans are spending at least half of what they make on rent. “We need to increase the subsidies or create more subsidies to make it appealing for developers to build affordable housing,” concluded Hamilton."
2017-02-01,Best Sector ETFs For February: Getting Cyclical...Sort Of,"February is here, and although the second month of the year resides in the stronger of the two six-month periods for stocks, this month is not known for jaw-dropping equity returns. Over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has posted an average loss of 0.2 percent, according to EquityClock.com. Cyclicality However, as is the case with the other 11 months of the year, there are sector-level opportunities for tactical investors this month. The sectors and the related exchange traded funds that typically thrive in February or cyclical in nature, but investors should be careful with the cyclical theme because some of February's worst-performing sector ETFs are also cyclical plays. February's Darlings Without further ado, the best-performing member of the sector SPDR suite in February, dating back to the suite's first full year of trading in 1999, is the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB). XLB, the largest materials ETF by assets, posts an average February gain of nearly two percent, according to CXO Advisory data. XLB is in fine form to start 2017 after posting a 4.5 percent gain in January and that is after the benchmark materials ETF gained nearly 17 percent in 2016. February is one of five months in which XLB is one of the two best sector SPDRs. Other Sector ETFs Dear To February's Heart Speaking of sector SPDR ETFs that were stellar performers last year and, historically, do well in February there is the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE:XLE). After soaring 28 percent last year, XLE is scuffling to start 2017 after slumping 3.2 percent in January. XLE, the largest equity-based energy ETF, posts an average February gain of over one percent, according to CXO data. Not So Special Sectors For February Several sector SPDR ETFs have, historically, notched negative showings in February and the Technology SPDR (ETF) (NYSE:XLK) is one of those funds. After Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s after-hours surge of three percent Tuesday on a bullish earnings report, it is possible that XLK defies its historical precedent this month as the iPhone maker is its largest holding. XLK's average February worse is just over one percent, but that is not nearly as bad as the nearly two percent typically lost by the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) in February, according to CXO data. That makes the largest financial services ETF the worst-performing member of the sector SPDR suite in the second month of the year. Disclosure: Todd Shriber owns shares of XLF.

2017-04-03,Best Sector ETF's For April: No Fooling Around,"For all the fanfare surrounding the purported bullishness of stocks in months such as January and December, April can be quite kind to equities. In fact, the S&P 500 has averaged an April return of 2 percent, making the fourth month of the year the best for the benchmark U.S. equity gauge, according to EquityClock.com. With April historically being a good month to own stocks, perhaps it is not surprising that the best performers among the sector SPDR suite of exchange traded funds are cyclical ETFs. For example, the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLI) is usually the best-performing sector SPDR ETF in the fourth month of the year. Industrials Lead The Way Dating back to 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR ETFs, XLI has averaged an April gain of about 3.5 percent, according to CXO Advisory data. Year-to-date, XLI, the largest industrial ETF by assets, is up 5 percent. XLI is historically the second-best performer in the month of March and in the second-best of the sector SPDRs in November, according to CXO data. The here-and-now market environment favors industrials. Industrials are a cyclical group and cyclicals historically outperform in the latter stages of the business cycle. Additionally, cyclical groups have historically been durable in the face of rising interest rates. With the possibility of the Federal Reserve boosting interest rates multiple times next year, industrials make for an ideal sector bet. Other Strong Contenders: Cyclicals Comes Around Again The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), another highly cyclical ETF, is the second-best SPDR in April with an average return of about 3.3 percent. XLB, the largest materials ETF by assets, is offer to a strong start this year after posting a first-quarter gain of 5.8 percent. April is one of five months in which XLB is one of the top two sector SPDR ETFs, according to CXO data. However, traders should be careful with XLB as it is usually the worst sector SPDR in May, one of three months in which XLB has that dubious distinction. As for April's worst SPDR, that “honor” goes to the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLP), but in a testament to the historical strength of U.S. stocks this month, XLP averages an April gain of more than 1 percent, according to CXO. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK), the largest technology ETF, is the second-worst SPDR in April, but its average April showing is not that bad. XLK has averaged April returns of more than 1 percent since 1999, according to CXO data.

2017-04-28,Best Sector ETF Ideas For May: A Surprise,"The May trading month starts Monday, and there will likely be the usual conjecture about selling in May and going away, but it is also worth remembering May is not the worst month of the year for stocks. Not even close. In fact, the S&P 500 usually rises in the fifth month of the year. Over the past 20 years, the benchmark U.S. equity gauge has posted an average return of 0.3 percent in the month of May, according to EquityClock.com. Come What May As is the case with the other 11 months of the year, some sectors and the corresponding exchange traded funds stand taller than others in the fifth month of the year. Among the best-performing sector SPDR ETFs in May, the leader on a historical basis is the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE:XLE). XLE, the largest equity-based energy ETF by assets, has posted an average May gain of about 1.5 percent going back to 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR ETFs, according to CXO Advisory data. With XLE down 9.5 percent and ranking as one of the worst sector ETFs on a year-to-date basis, investors would love to see the giant energy fund notch a positive May performance. Stepping Aside For Staples On a historical basis, the second-best performer among the sector SPDR ETFs in May is the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLP). XLP, the largest consumer staples ETF by assets, averages a May gain of just over 1 percent, according to CXO data. XLP has already been a solid performer to this point in 2017 with a year-to-date gain of 7.3 percent. None of the original sector SPDR ETFs average negative returns in May, but there are some that notch negligible gains. That is the case for the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLY). However, with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s XLY growing, continued upside for that stock could keep discretionary ETFs strong in May. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) usually trades flat in May, according to CXO data, making it the worst-performing SPDR in the fifth month on a historical basis. XLB is the largest materials ETF and is up 8 percent year-to-date. Related Links: What Will Companies Do With Their Tax Savings?

2017-07-03,Best Sector ETFs For July,"July is here and although the seventh month of the year clearly resides in the weaker six-month period for stocks, the S&P 500 usually is not too bad in July. Over the past 20 Julys, the benchmark U.S. equity gauge has averaged a gain of 0.7 percent while closing higher 50 percent of the time. At the sector level, there are opportunities in July, but seasonal traders should be careful when expecting exceptional July performances from the sector SPDR suite of exchange-traded funds and rival sector ETFs. Historical data indicate that in July, finding sector SPDR ETFs that offer notable outperformance of the S&P 500 itself is difficult, but there are some sector ETFs worth considering in the seventh month of the year. The Good News In what could be seen as a potentially positive sign, two of July's best-performing sector SPDR ETFs are track stocks in cyclical sectors. For example, the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF) averages a July gain of just over 1 percent, according to CXO Advisory data. Going back to 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR ETFs, XLF, the largest ETF tracking the financial services sector, has been the best-performing SPDR in July. Year to date, XLF is trailing the S&P 500 by more than 200 basis points. July is one of just two months along with March in which XLF is one of the two best SPDRs. Keeping with the cyclical theme, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) is usually July's second-best sector SPDR ETF with an average gain of over half a percent, according to CXO data. The Bad News There are some sector laggards in July and they prove the dangers of conventional thinking. For those thinking that energy and utilities stocks heat up in July simply because summer travel is in high gear and air conditioning use increases, think again. The Utilities SPDR (ETF) (NYSE:XLU), the largest utilities ETF, averages a modest July loss, according to CXO. XLU is the second-worst performer among the sector SPDR ETFs in July. The dubious honor of being the worst July performer on a historical basis goes to the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE:XLE), though XLE's July losses, on average, are not severe. Down almost 14 percent this year, XLE has another dubious honor. It is the only sector SPDR ETF lower on a year-to-date basis. July is the only month in which XLE is one of the two worst-performing SPDRs while this is one of three months in which that distinction applies to XLU. Disclosure: Todd Shriber owns shares of XLF.

2017-09-01,Best Sector ETFs For September: Playing It Safe,"August lived up to its historical billing as the worst month for U.S. equities. While the S&P 500's modest decline did not match the average 1.3-percent drop seen in the previous 20 Augusts, this August was the first month of 2017 in which the benchmark U.S. equity index closed in the red. Now, September is here and the arrival of the ninth month of year could bring additional struggles for U.S. equities. On a historical basis, September is the second-worst month of the year for the S&P 500 behind only August. Over the past 20 Septembers, the S&P 500 has averaged a decline of 0.6 percent, according to EquityClock.com. At the sector level, there are opportunities in September, but given the month's often ominous reputation, it may not be surprising to learn that some of the best-performing sector exchange-traded funds in September are defensive plays. Turn The Lights On Despite two interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve this year with plans for another by year-end, the rate-sensitive utilities sector is setting a torrid pace. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU) is up more than 13 percent year to date. XLU and rival utilities ETFs currently reside near all-time highs. That is a positive heading into September, one of the months in which XLU is the best-performing sector SPDR ETF. Dating back to 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDRs, XLU averages a September gain of almost 1 percent, according to CXO Advisory data. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLP), another defensive play, is the second-best SPDR in September on a historical basis. However, underscoring September's dour reputation, XLP averages a modest September decline, according to CXO. XLP, the largest consumer staples ETF, is up just 5.8 percent year-to-date and has seen $1.7 billion in third-quarter outflows, more than any other ETF. September Isn't Kind To These ETFs Sure it is up about 10 percent this year, but the September precedent for the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) is gloomy. XLB, the largest materials ETF by assets, averages a September decline of nearly 3 percent, according to CXO data. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) is usually the second-worst sector SPDR ETF in September, averaging a decline of 2 percent. This year, XLK is the best-performing sector SPDR fund as investors have continually bid tech stocks higher. Given investors' enthusiasm for the sector, it is not unreasonable to expect XLK to betray its historical reputation this September.

2017-09-28,Some Mining ETFs Are On Shaky Ground,"The materials sector is one of the smallest sector weights in the S&P 500, but that status is not preventing the group from turning in a solid showing in 2017. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA: XLB), the largest materials exchange traded fund by assets, is up more than 13 percent year-to-date. Drilling down into the broader materials sector, some analysts see weakness afoot for metals and mining equities. Broadly speaking, ETFs tracking such stocks have been laggards this year, as highlighted by a mere 5.3 percent year-to-date gain for the SPDR S&P Metals and Mining ETF (NYSEARCA: XME). XME provides equal-weight exposure to miners of gold and silver as well industrial metals miners and producers, meaning the ETF is also exposed to demand trends for the likes of aluminum and copper, among other metals. Of Course It's About China As the world's largest commodities consumer, China remains a key driver of price action in ETFs like XME. That may be alright for now, but some analysts believe that theme could be a problem in the not-too-distant future. “With few exceptions, we continue to see mined commodity and miner share prices as overvalued, propped up by Chinese stimulus,” said Morningstar in a recent research note. “Iron ore's relative buoyancy since early 2016 is emblematic of most industrial commodities.” There are signs that China's ability to prop up demand for industrial metals could be weakening, which could signal downside for ETFs such as XME. “We do not expect this to last,” said Morningstar. “With China's credit growth slowing, we continue to expect mined commodity prices in general, and particularly iron ore, to fall materially and for share prices to follow. Miners we cover are generally substantially overvalued, and few trade in line with our fair value estimates.” More About XME XME holds just 29 stocks, about 18 percent of which are gold and silver miners. While precious metals miners are typically responsive to price trends in those underlying metals, XME's exposure to gold and silver is not enough to obfuscate its potential vulnerability to industrial metals weakness. Alone, steel stocks are 47.5 percent of XME's weight, exposing the ETF to metallurgical coal and iron ore demand trends. Aluminum equities account for 11.3 percent of the ETF's roster. “We forecast a significant deceleration in aluminum demand growth and anticipate that the impact of capacity cuts will prove far overstated,” according to Morningstar. “Accordingly, we forecast a long-term aluminum price of only $1,475 per metric ton (in real terms), nearly 30 percent below current levels.” Related Links: Beautiful Bank ETFs.

2017-12-01,Best Sector ETFs For December: An Interesting Mix,"December is here and with the arrival of the last month of the year usually comes some solid performances for U.S. equities. Over the past 20 Decembers, the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 1.5 percent and a win rate of 75 percent, according to EquityClock.com. The S&P 500's average gain of 1.5 percent in December means this month is tied with November as the fourth-best month of the year for the benchmark U.S. equity gauge. After climbing more than 0.8 percent Thursday to another record, the S&P 500 enters December up 18.3 percent year-to-date. Like any other month, December brings sector-level opportunities, trades that are often best expressed with exchange-traded funds Confirming December's bullishness, historical data indicate that since 1999, the first full year of trading for the original nine sector SPDR ETFs, none of those funds average a December loss. December's Best Confirming that cyclical sectors often work well later in the year, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), the largest materials ETF, is the best-performing SPDR in the last month of the year. XLB averages a December gain of nearly 2.5 percent, according to CXO Advisory data. XLB is up nearly 20 percent and hit a record high on Thursday. The $4.4 billion XLB holds just 25 stocks and tracks the Materials Select Sector Index. The second-best SPDR in December, usually is the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLV). XLV, the largest health care ETF, averages a December gain of just over 2 percent, according to CXO data. Up nearly 21 percent year-to-date, XLV is the second-best of the sector SPDR ETFs this year, trailing only its technology counterpart. December “Laggards” Knowing that December is usually kind to stocks and that none of the sector SPDRs average a loss in the 12th month, it's hard to say this month is bad for certain sectors. Still, some sector SPDRs are prone to lag. For example, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLP) averages a December gain of just about half a percent, according to CXO. That makes XLP the second-worst-performing sector SPDR in December. Perhaps surprisingly, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK), this year's best-performing sector SPDR, is usually the worst SPDR in December, averaging a negligible gain.

2017-12-05,Newly Merged DowDuPont Gets A Bullish Call From Goldman,"DowDuPont Inc (NYSE:DWDP) was formed due to the recent merger between Dow Chemical Co (NYSE:DOW) and E I Du Pont De Nemours And Co (NYSE:DD). The merger was completed Aug. 31, 2017. About three months into DowDuPont's existence as a merged entity, Goldman issued a bullish call on the combined company. The Analyst Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Koort reinstated coverage on the shares of DowDuPont with a Buy and 12-month price target of $91, suggesting 28-percent upside from current levels. The Thesis DowDupont offers one of the strongest self-help stories in the chemicals segment by transforming from a massive conglomerate to a group of more narrowly focused individual companies, Koort said in a Sunday note. (See Koort's track record here.) The company is set to spin off into at least three different companies — namely AgCo, MaterialCo and SpecialtyCo — in an 18-24 month timeframe, the analyst said. The transformation from a large conglomerate to a group of more narrowly focused and streamlined businesses creates an appealing investment opportunity due to the following reasons, Koort said: The cost-cutting potential offered by the high cost structure of the company. Increased investor interest for various businesses, with expectations that robust segmental data provided by the company will lift valuations. The more narrowly focused businesses will have more strategic optionality. Although agriculture and commodities have less attractive industry expectations, Goldman expects 17-percent EBITDA growth, thanks to cost and growth synergies and solid specialties trends. The multiple expansion should evolve as investors delve deeper into the fundamentals of each DWDP spin-off entity (AgCo, MaterialCo and SpecialtyCo) and as options for strategic optionality arise, Koort said. On valuation, Goldman said DowDupont has substantially underperformed the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) over the last year, suggesting upside opportunity that could be realized as it begins separating into three portfolio businesses. The Price Action Shares of DowDupont are up over 26 percent year-to-date. Since the Aug. 31 merger, the stock is up a more modest 8 percent.

2018-01-02,The Best Sector ETFs For January: Familiar Leadership,"January is here and for stocks, that may not be the best news. Although January is in the middle of the stronger six-month period for equities, the first month of the year is historically unkind to stocks. Perhaps surprising to some investors, the S&P 500 averaged a January loss of 0.5 percent over the past 20 Januarys while posting positive returns just half the time. Still, opportunities remain at the sector level. If historical trends remain true to form this January, some of last year's best-performing sector exchange traded funds could start 2018 on strong footing. In fact, some of 2017's best sector ETFs historically perform well in January. That includes the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLV). XLV, the largest healthcare ETF by assets, jumped just over 19 percent, putting it in the upper echelon of the sector SPDR funds. XLV averages a January gain of less than 1 percent, but that is good enough to make it the best-performing sector SPDR ETF in the first month of the year since 1999, according to CXO Advisory data. January and December are the only two months of the year where XLV ranks as the best or second-best of the sector SPDR ETFs. Talking Tech The Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) surged nearly 32 percent last year, making it the best of the sector SPDRs for 2017. Bolstered by the likes of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), technology, the largest sector weight in the S&P 500, was the best-performing sector in the U.S. last year. It remains to be seen if technology can come close to duplicating its 2017 ways in 2018, but XLK is the second-best SPDR, usually, in January. The benchmark tech ETF averages a meager January gain, according to CXO. January is one of three months in which XLK is the best or second-best sector SPDR on a historical basis. August and October are the others. January Duds The worst-performing sector SPDRs in January are highly cyclical plays. Dubious January honors belong to the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) and the Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLI). XLB averages a January loss of more than 2 percent, making it the worst sector SPDR in the first month of the year, while XLI's average January loss is almost 2 percent, according to CXO. XLB and XLI gained 21.6 percent and 21.4 percent, respectively, last year. Related Links: Bearish On The Energy Patch Staples ETFs Leave Investors Wanting More"
2018-01-18,Technical Strategist Turns Cautious Amid Parabolic Run: 'Healthy Correction May Be Just Around The Corner',"The U.S. stock market has been on such a red-hot run in recent months that even market bulls are starting to say a healthy pull-back could be imminent. On Thursday, Piper Jaffray analyst Craig Johnson said key technical indicators suggest the market has become overbought in the short-term. “We have scaled back our equity exposure in our Model Portfolio as we believe a healthy correction may be just around the corner,” Johnson said. He said market sentiment is currently at a seven-year high on tax reform optimism, and a handful of key momentum and breadth indicators are painting a very bearish near-term picture for stocks. From a fundamental perspective, Johnson says the U.S. economy is showing no signs of slowing down. The latest estimates suggest U.S. GDP growth topped 3 percent in the fourth quarter for the third consecutive quarter. FactSet estimates S&P 500 companies earnings growth rate averaged 10.2 percent in Q4. Sector Analysis Johnson may be expecting a broad market pullback, but he's more bearish about some market sectors than others. He downgraded the Health Care sector to Underweight based on deteriorating fundamentals in the space in recent weeks. Piper Jaffray also has Underweight ratings on Utilities and Consumer Staples. On the other hand, Johnson is relatively bullish on Energy stocks. He said optimism about OPEC production cuts has triggered a “building bull market” in oil stocks. Piper Jaffray is also bullish on the Basic Materials and Technology sectors. How To Play It Traders who want to mitigate risks by setting up sector-based pair trades based on Johnson’s recommendations might consider the following SPDR ETF positions.

2018-02-01,The Best Sector ETFs For February: Calling On Commodities,"February is here, but that may not mean much to U.S. stocks. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 has been flat in February, posting an average win rate of 55 percent. The best February performance for the S&P 500 over those two decades came in 1998, when the benchmark U.S. equity gauge jumped 7 percent, according to EquityClock.com. While the track record of the S&P 500 in February is uninspired, there are sector-level opportunities available that can be best captured with exchange traded funds. Several of the sector SPDR ETFs average February declines, but some others post solid gains in the second month of the year. Two of the best performers are levered to the commodities trade. Magnificent Materials Dating to 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR suite, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) is the best performer in February. XLB, the largest materials ETF by assets, averages a February gain of almost 2 percent, according to CXO Advisory data. After gaining 24 percent last year, XLB is up 4 percent to start 2018. February is one of five months in which XLB ranks as the best or second-best sector SPDR ETF on a historical basis, according to CXO. The $5.31-billion XLB holds 25 stocks, but DowDuPont Inc. (NYSE:DWDP) accounts for over 23 percent of the ETF's weight, more than triple the weight assigned to XLB's second-largest holding. Energy Excellence The Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) is usually the second-best sector SPDR in February. XLE, the largest equity-based energy ETF, averages a February gain of about 1.5 percent, according to CXO data. After falling nearly 1 percent last year, making it one of 2017's worst-performing sector SPDRs, XLE is up 3.6 percent to start 2018. The $19.71-billion XLE holds 32 stocks, but Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX), the two largest U.S. oil companies, combine for nearly 40 percent of the ETF's weight. XLE ranks as the second-best sector SPDR on a historical basis in February, March and April, according to CXO. Related Links: Focusing On Financials In February A Fabulous Pharma ETF"
2018-02-12,Finding Opportunity In Steel ETFs,"Perhaps not surprisingly, the materials sector, a high beta group, got caught up in the recent equity market sell-off. Year-to-date, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), the largest materials exchange traded fund by assets, is down 3.5 percent. Although the broader materials sector struggled in recent weeks, some analysts said opportunity remains with steel stocks. CFRA Research recently issued a favorable view on steel equities, including AK Steel Holding Corp.(NASDAQ:AKS) and Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (NYSE:CLF). “Automakers have successfully reduced the weight of vehicles by hundreds of pounds; much more weight reduction is required, however, to meet new fuel efficiency standards,” CFRA equity analyst Matt Miller said in a recent note. “Innovations in steel technology have generated advanced high strength steels that strike the correct balance of strength, formability, weight and cost. Despite ongoing market share gains for aluminum and other composite materials, AHSS remains the preferred material in auto manufacturing.” Holding Up Pretty Well While XLB recently tumbled, the VanEck Vectors Steel ETF (NYSE:SLX) is higher by nearly 1 percent this year. The $161.8-million SLX holds 27 stocks, including a combined 3.1-percent allocation to Cleveland-Cliffs and AK Steel. “AKS produces virtually every grade of AHSS and is pursuing innovations in steel technologies, including advances in third-generation AHSS,” said CFRA's Miller. “During 2017, AKS acquired Precision Partners, a leader in advanced product design engineered solutions and tool design and build. Precision gives AKS an end-to-end solution, pairing AKS with Precision's tool and die and stamping capabilities. As of Feb. 8, AKS traded at a forward 12-month consensus EV/EBITDA of 6.6X, 13 percent below the 7.6x average of the broader steel market.” Year-to-date, investors have added about $10 million to SLX after pulling $61.3 million from the ETF last year. Other Ideas The $850.3-million SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (NYSE:XME) is a diversified play on metals and mining equities with an almost 48-percent weight to steel stocks, by far XME's largest industry exposure. XME is down about 5.6 percent this year, but it allocates 4.4 percent of its weight to Cleveland Cliffs. “By 2020, CLF expects to be the sole producer of hot briquetted iron in the Great Lakes region from its first production plant in Toledo, Ohio,” said CFRA. “HBI is a premium form of direct reduced iron with a high iron content (more than 90 percent) and is used as a substitute for scrap by electric arc furnaces. We think the HBI facility is a strategically important project (with strong capital returns), given the rise in EAFs (vs. blast furnaces). As of Feb. 8, CLF traded at a NTM consensus EV/EBITDA of 6.2x, an 18-percent discount to steel peers.” CFRA has a marketweight rating on XME.

2018-04-05,A Sector ETF To Be Bullish On,"It can be hard to be bullish on sectors when they are slumping: just look at the materials sector. It's one of the smallest sector weights in the S&P 500, but it is sporting one of the largest year-to-date losses. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) is lower by 5.7 percent, a performance that is nearly 500 basis points worse than the S&P 500. Still, some analysts see opportunity with XLB, the largest materials exchange traded fund by assets. Every month, AltaVista Research publishes a report on the 10 sector SPDR ETFs, including XLB. For April, XLB is the only fund with an Overweight rating. AltaVista rates the other sector SPDR ETFs Neutral or Underweight. “Typically, funds in this category consist of stocks trading at attractive valuations and/or having above-average fundamentals,” AltaVista said of its Overweight rating. Diving Into XLB The $4.56-billion XLB tracks the Materials Select Sector Index and holds 25 stocks. This is a cap-weighted ETF and a top-heavy one at that, as DowDuPont Inc. (NYSE:DWDP) accounts for 21.8 percent of XLB's roster. No other stock accounts for more than 8.2 percent of XLB's weight. Over 72 percent of XLB's holdings are chemical manufacturers, while 13 percent are containers and packaging firms. XLB devotes about 10.5 percent of its weight to metals and mining firms, companies that have been affected, for better and worse, by the Trump administration's tariffs. Domestic industrial metals makers, including aluminum and steel producers, initially rallied when the tariffs were announced, but the White House subsequently unveiled diluted versions of the initial tariffs. Waiting On The Bulls “Comparisons between forecasts and historical results are distorted by the recent merger of DowDupont, which dominates the fund, and as a result our rating should be discounted,” said AltaVista. “Nonetheless we know that abundant domestic energy supplies are spurring an investment boom among the chemical firms that comprise about 70 percent of the sector, and the sell-side analysts who cover these firms have been growing increasingly bullish.” Related Links: Small-Cap ETFs Looked Good Last Month Low Vol EM ETFs Holding Up Well"
2018-04-30,Best Sector ETFs for May: Getting Defensive,"In equity markets, May's reputation is not the best. After all, it is the month that investors are supposed to sell in and go away, according to the old adage. To be fair, the historical performance of the S&P 500 in the fifth month of the year is neither good nor bad. Over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has averaged a flat showing in May. Some sectors and the related exchange traded funds have historically delivered a little more excitement in May. At the sector level, some May stars include defensive sectors, some of which are struggling year-to-date. That includes the Consumer Staples Select SPDR (NYSE:XLP). XLP, the largest consumer staples ETF by assets, is lower by 10.76 percent year-to-date, making it the worst-performing sector SPDR ETF. What Happened A confluence of factors has hampered XLP and rival staples ETFs this year, including investors' preference for growth sectors, rising interest rates and disappointing earnings reports. The rising dollar could further pinch the sector. With those factors in mind, it would be nice for staples bulls if XLP lives up to its historical reputation as the best-performing sector SPDR in May. XLP averages May gains of over 1 percent, according to CXO Advisory. May is the only month of the year in which XLP is one of the two best sector SPDR ETFs. Why It's Important Another defensive sector, health care, can be a solid performer in May. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLV) is usually the second-best sector SPDR behind XLP in the fifth month of the year, according to CXO. XLV, the largest health care ETF, is up just over 1 percent year-to-date. The ETF averages May gains of just under 1 percent. What's Next Historical data indicate that some sectors struggle in May. It is the extent to which those groups struggle that investors should consider. For example, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLY) is the second-worst of the sector SPDRs in May, but XLY still manages to generate positive returns. The same cannot be said of the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), which averages a negative May performance, making it the worst-performing sector SPDR fund in the fifth month of the year.

2018-06-11,Materials ETFs Show Signs Of Life,"The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) and other materials exchange-traded funds struggled to start 2018, but the group has recently shown signs of perking up. Last week, XLB gained about 3 percent, pushing its June gain to 4 percent, a move that's erased a year-to-date loss. What Happened Earlier this year, the materials sector struggled following the Trump Administration's tariff push and speculation that global trade wars were imminent. “Increasing political tensions across major world markets are beginning to feed through to producers in the US,” said Markit in a recent note. “Greater speculation regarding metal prices and lower global demand for US manufactured goods has dropped the basic materials sector into a lower gear. That said, as the rhetoric regarding a 'trade-war' appears to be fading, the effects are also expected to subside.” XLB, which tracks the Materials Select Sector Index, provides exposure to “chemical, construction material, containers and packaging, metals and mining, and paper and forest products industries,” according to State Street Global Advisors (SsgA). Why It's Important Demand conditions are improving as are new orders, but there's still some uncertainty surrounding materials companies due to tariff issues. “Recently introduced tariffs on global imports of steel and aluminium by the US (exempt for the EU until 1st June 2018) have sparked retaliation from key export partners, with initial trade talks breaking down,” said Markit. “This comes at a time when global demand for inputs is already strong. Higher resulting import prices have impacted US firms' balance sheets and added pressure to supply chains. Both input costs and output prices have consequently risen sharply throughout 2018 so far.” XLB's 24 holdings include only U.S.-based companies. DowDuPont Inc. (NYSE:DWDP) is the ETF's largest holding at a weight of 24.36 percent. That is more than triple the weight assigned to XLB's second-largest holding. What's Next Data suggest input prices for materials firms are declining while output prices are surging. The specter of retaliation from U.S. trading partners could force some materials producers to scale back on growth projects. “Over the last few years chemicals manufacturers have been investing heavily in new facilities and capacity expansion,” according to Markit. “Such large investments have left the sector vulnerable to recent metal price hikes, notably steel used in the construction of these plants, which is expected to hit profit margins. If such expenditures are to remain viable and tariffs were to continue, domestic customers are likely to need to fill the gap that a loss of global demand could leave.” Related Links: An ETF For Tech Contrarians A Low Vol Idea For Rising Rates"
2018-06-19,A Look Back At What's Happened To Each Sector Through The First Half Of 2018 (Part 2),"It may not be as large as the bond market or as ubiquitous as real estate, but the stock market is definitely the most talked about of the financial markets. And while this has pretty much always been the case, the rise of index investing and robo-advisors in the last decade or so has certainly opened up the stock market to a new generation of investors. For those just getting into the market or testing their chops in Quicken Loans fantasy stock league, we’ve put together a primer on just what is happening across each of the main sectors. There are 11 sectors according to the global industry classification standard, and here’s what each of them has done in the first half 2018. We already covered the 2018 performance of the five largest sectors in this article, here’s a breakdown of the rest. Energy 2018 has seen the resurgence of oil, with West Texas Intermediate-grade (WTI) oil priced above the $60 benchmark that most analysts consider a healthy range for the commodity. This sustained price strength, which briefly surpassed $70 in mid-May, means higher margins for companies like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and drilling supply company Schlumberger Limited. (NYSE:SLB). Other industries under the energy umbrella, such as natural gas concerns Newfield Exploration (NYSE:NFX) and Continental Resources, Inc. (NYSE:CLR), have also found upside in the high global demand for energy. Heading into the second half of 2018, investors in this sector should be aware of the potential for falling demand as world’s central banks raise interest rates to stem possible inflation, which could have a negative impact on price. The Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLE) is up 3.67 percent year-to-date as of this writing. Consumer Staples On the other end of the consumer spending scale are manufacturers and suppliers of food, health, and other consumable goods. Typically these companies have stock charts that plot a slow and steady pattern and are considered long-term investments that store value. However, Multinational food and household goods companies like Kraft Heinz Co. (NASDAQ:KHC), The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have all struggled to gain the favor of investors in light of the strong showing from performance stocks in the tech or biotech industries. While it might be easy to count this sector out for the remainder of 2018, there is very little fundamentally wrong with these companies. Each of them has posted a string of quarterly revenue results in line with analyst estimates. As always, they remain a good option if and when uncertainty or volatility appear in the market. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLP) is down 10.72 percent year-to-date as of this writing. Materials Perhaps the most volatile sector heading into the back half of the year, U.S. companies that mine, process or in some way manufacture basic materials like gold, steel and aluminum could see a lot of interesting activity as America’s mult-front trade war continues to d/evolve. The initial announcement of tariffs on Chinese-imported steel and aluminum was at first seen as a major boon to companies like Alcoa Corp. (NYSE:AA) and United States Steel Company (NYSE:X), which would have presumably seen an uptick in domestic business. However, now that Europe, Canada and Mexico are also involved and there is the potential that those countries will put tariffs on U.S.-made materials, the picture for many raw materials companies is less certain. However, such uncertainty could mean more interest in safety investments like gold, which benefits precious metal mining outfits like Newmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM). The Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLB) is down 1.57 ercent year-to-date as of this writing. Telecommunication Services With the rolling back of data collection and net-neutrality regulations earlier in the year and the planned merger of several major cable and phone service providers, telecom companies now have greater control over consumer data and access to online services then ever before. However, all of the inside activity and legislation on the part of AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), T-Mobile US Inc. (NYSE:TMUS) and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) to acquiree media concerns like Time Warner Inc. (NYSE:TWX) and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. (NYSE:FOXA) have created a lot of uncertainty in the media space. As a result, he big name in this sector have traded sideways while these massive mergers have been worked out. That’s not to say there hasn’t been trader enthusiasm for telecom, but it has materialized around less monolithic players in the space like 2017 IPO Roku Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU). The Vanguard Telecommunication Services ETF (NYSES: VOX) is down 5.5 percent year-to-date. Utilities Like consumer staples, utilities are generally considered value sponges for most investors. As a result, share price in these companies tend to remain within a certain range and aren’t expected to change dramatically over a short period. Because of the strength of the equity market and the surplus of energy commodities like natural gas and coal, the chart for utility providers Dominion Energy NextEra Energy Inc (NYSE:NEE) and Duke Energy Corp (NYSE:DKE) are showing a down trend. However. there are bright spots among utility companies who have diversified into new forms of energy and have prioritized new technologies. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE:NEE) and AES Corp (NYSE:AES) are both positive year-to-date and both boast exposure to renewable technology. Another recent surprise in the sector is Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE), whose stock saw a 16 percent spike in June after private investors with a stake in the company released a note suggesting the sale and restructuring of the company to unlock greater value in the future. Right now for utilities, the future is where growth lies. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLU) is down 3.92 percent year-to-date as of this writing Real Estate The real estate market boomed over the course of 2017 and into 2018. Adjusted for inflation, home prices are the highest they have ever been and mortgage rates have just surpassed 4.5 percent. The housing market is on fire, and real estate in general is in demand. However, for investors hoping to find their fortune with homebuilders and real estate companies, the high demand for land and the architecture has driven up costs, a price spike that is only exacerbated by the spectre of tariffs driving down supply and driving up the cost of lumber, steel, aluminum and everything else that typically makes a building. Because of this, homebuilders like Lennar Corporation (NYSE:LEN) and Toll Brothers Inc (NYSE:TOL), as well as some REIT companies that lease properties like Prologis Inc (NYSE:PLD) have struggled to grow either their assets or their share price. That said, residential REITs do have the advantage of of tight real estate market to drive demand for affordable rental properties. The Real Estate Select Sectors SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLRE) is down 4.49 percent year-to-date."
2018-07-05,Best Sector ETFs For July: Some Surprises,"July has started and that could mean some turbulence for stocks. After all, the third quarter can be unkind to equities and July sits firmly in the middle of the worst six-month period for stocks. On a historical basis, July itself isn't always bad. Over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has gained an average of 0.40 percent in July, according to EquityClock.com. That makes July easily the best month in third quarter on a historical basis as the S&P 500 usually falter in August and September. What To Know As is the case with any other month of the year, July brings sector-level opportunities. Using the nine legacy sector SPDR exchange traded funds as the gauges, seven of those nine funds average positive finishes in July. The sector SPDR ETFs debuted in late 1998, so there are a fair amount of July performances to consider. Some of the sector SPDRs with reputations for solid July performances are among this year's laggard sector funds. That includes the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF). The largest financial services ETF by asset is usually the best-performing sector SPDR in July, averaging a gain of just over 1 percent, according to CXO Advisory. Why It's Important XLF enters July with a year-to-date loss of over 5 percent and will soon be tested by second-quarter earnings. On July 13, several of XLF's marquee constituents deliver second-quarter results. As for other potential winners among the sector SPDR ETFs in July, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) is the usually the second-best in July behind XLF. XLB, the largest materials ETF, usually averages a July gain of just under 1 percent, according to CXO data. XLB is down 4.74 percent year-to-date. What Happened Among the worst-performing sector SPDRs in July is one ETF that has recently been shedding its bearish ways. After tumbling through the first five months of 2018, the Utilities Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU) began rebounding last month and is higher by 5.36 percent over the past month. Hopefully for utilities bulls, XLU doesn't live up to its July reputation for modest losses. The energy sector, one of handful of sectors in the green this year, can lag in July. According to CXO data, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) averages a modest July, making it the worst-performing member of the sector SPDR suite, on a historical basis, in the seventh month of the year. XLE enters July with a year-to-date gain of over 4 percent. Disclosure: The author owns shares of XLF.

2018-08-01,Best Sector ETFs For August: An Interesting Mix,"August is here and if history holds true to form, this could be a challenging month for domestic stocks. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 averages a loss of 1 percent in the eighth month of the year, according to EquityClock.com. That makes August the worst month of the year for the S&P 500 and one of four months in which the benchmark U.S. equity gauge averages a monthly loss. What To Know Knowing that August is one of the worst months of the year for stocks, it's not surprising upside sector-level opportunities are limited. At least that's what the historical data say. Using the original nine sector SPDR exchange traded funds as the barometers, only two of those funds average gains in August, according to CXO Advisory data. On a historical basis, the best-performing sector SPDR ETF in August is the Technology Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK), the largest technology ETF by assets. XLK averages a meager August gain of less than 1 percent, according to CXO data. The benchmark tech ETF's ability to start August on a strong note will be immediately tested because Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), XLK's largest holding, reported earnings after the close of U.S. markets Tuesday. Apple is by far XLK's largest holding, commanding over 14 percent of the ETF's weight. (Editor's note: This article was written before Apple's Q3 earnings were released.) Why It's Important With August being a potentially trying month for stocks, perhaps it's not surprising one of the better sectors to consider this month is a conservative play. Enter the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU), the second-best sector SPDR in August, according to CXO data. Like XLK, XLU averages scant August gains. And like XLK, XLU's ability to live up to its decent August reputation will be immediately tested by some important earnings news as several of the utilities ETF's largest holdings report second-quarter earnings this week. What's Next While seven of the original sector SPDR ETFs average August declines, the losses usually aren't severe. Two of the worst offenders are heavily cyclical plays. On a historical basis, the the Consumer Discretionary Select SPDR (NYSE:XLY) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) are the worst sector SPDRs in August, but each fund's usual August declines are less than 1 percent.

2018-09-03,Best Sector ETFs For September: Fed Plays,"September trading arrives and if history is an accurate, the ninth month of the year could be tricky to navigate for domestic equities. Over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has averaged September losses of 0.8 percent, making that month the second-worst month of the year on average for the benchmark U.S. equity gauge. Of course, those historical trends don't hold true every month. For example, heading into this year, the S&P 500 averaged a 1 percent loss in August over the past 20 years, but that index is up more than 3 percent this year for the month of August. What Happened With September being a historically rough month for U.S. stocks, sector-level opportunities are hard to come by. Using the original nine sector SPDR exchange-traded funds as the barometers, data indicate just two of those ETFs average positive September returns. Since 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR ETFs, the best performer in September is the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLF). XLF, the largest financial services ETF, averages a modest September gain, according to CXO Advisory data. Month-to-date, XLF is up 1.5 percent, but traders could embrace the fund amid expectations it's almost a sure thing that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates for the third time this year in September. Why It's Important Looking at potential sector ETF winners for September 2018 through the lens of further Fed tightening, it may be interesting to learn that the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU) is usually the second-best SPDR in September, according to CXO data. XLU is up 2.4 percent in August, but the largest utilities ETF's recent bullishness could be challenged by another rate hike because the utilities sector is usually inversely correlated to rising Treasury yields. After September, XLU ranks as one of the two worst sector SPDRs in October and November. What's Next Speaking of bad sector ideas on a monthly basis, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) usually struggles in September, averaging losses of about 2.5 percent in the ninth month of the year. However, investors may want to give XLB a chance later in the month because the materials ETF is one of the two best SPDRs, historically speaking, in each month of the fourth quarter, according to CXO data.

2018-10-01,Best Sector ETFs For October: 3 Stocks Really Matter,"October is here and despite the month's reputation for ominous market events, the tenth month of the year is often kind to U.S. stocks. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 averaged October gains of 2.2 percent, according to EquityClock.com. That makes October the best month of the year in terms of average returns for the S&P 500, slightly outperforming March. October equity market strength is felt at the sector level. Historical data confirm that since 1999, the first full year of trading for the original nine sector SPDR exchange traded funds, all nine of those funds average positive returns in October. What's interesting about the two sector SPDR ETFs that are usually the best performers in October is that these two funds are dominated by a small number of stocks. A Graveyard Smash The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), the largest ETF by assets tracking that sector, averages October gains of close to 3 percent, according to CXO Advisory data. That makes XLB the second-best sector SPDR in October, on a historical basis. If historical trends hold true to form, XLB could be worth holding throughout the fourth quarter as it ranks as one of the two best SPDRs in each of the three months of the year's final quarter, according to CXO data. DowDuPont Inc. (NYSE:DWDP) will play a big role in XLB's ability to live up to historical billing because that stocks accounts for over 22 percent of the ETF's weight, more than double the weight assigned to any of the fund's other holdings. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) is usually the best-performing sector SPDR in October, averaging gains of over 3 percent, according to CXO data. With the recent debut of the communication services sector, XLK will have to defend its October reputation without some familiar names. Some stocks previously classified as technology names moved over to communication services, leaving XLK's fortunes largely in the hands of just two stocks. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) now combine for over 37 percent of XLK's weight. Trick Or Treat The rate-sensitive Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU) and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLV) are usually the two worst-performing sector SPDRs in October, but that's not necessarily bad news. Underscoring the month's strong reputation, XLU and XLV average October gains of about 1.6 percent, according to CXO data. Related Links: A Nifty China ETF Europe On Sale"
2018-11-02,Best Sector ETFs For November: Loving The Unloved,"After a bloody October for U.S. stocks, several sectors enter November battered. October brought some of the worst monthly losses on record for several sectors and the related exchange traded funds and that's true across styles and market cap segments. So it may not be surprising some investors are relieved November is here. Over the past 20 Novembers, the S&P 500 averaged a gain of 1.4 percent, making the 11th month of the year one of the better months for U.S. stocks. What Happened Given October's carnage, some of the sectors that historically perform well in November are limping into the new month. That's true of the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB). Since 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR ETFs, XLB has been the best performer in November, averaging a gain of close to 3 percent according to CXO Advisory. XLB, the largest materials ETF by assets, stumbled in October as several of the fund's marquee constituents reported slack third-quarter earnings. Investors reacted by departing XLB in a big way. “More than $448 million was pulled from State Street Corp.’s Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund, or XLB, last week, reducing its assets by 15 percent to $3.18 billion, the lowest in at least a year, according to Bloomberg data,” reports Bloomberg. Why It's Important October 2018 was one of the worst months on record for S&P 500 industrial stocks, The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLI) will try to shake off its October woes to live up to its November precedent. XLI is usually the second-best SPDR behind XLB in November, averaging a gain of around 2.6 percent, according to CXO data. XLI, the largest industrial ETF, is coming off a double-digit October loss. Some of its ability to rebound in November could be challenged by next week's midterm elections. If aerospace and defense stocks react adversely to the election results, XLI and other industrial ETFs could see more November rain than fame. What's Next Here is where things get interesting. XLB and XLI, in that order, are also the two best-performing SPDRs in December before transitioning to being the two worst in January, according to CXO data. So if historical trends hold, the next 90 days should be interesting for these two ETFs. Related Links: These Sector ETFs Stunk In October A New E-commerce ETF Is Coming"
2018-12-03,Best Sector ETFs For December: Repeat Performers,"December is believed to be a good month for U.S. equities and historical data affirm that belief. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 averages a December gain of 1.4 percent, according to EquityClock.com. That ties December with November as the fourth-best month of the year for the S&P 500 over the past two decades. What To Know At the sector level, December brings some familiar opportunities accessible via exchange traded funds. Familiar because the sector ETFs with strong December reputations have historically performed well in November, too. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), the largest materials ETF by assets, averages a December gain of around 2.50 percent, according to CXO Advisory data. That makes XLB the best sector SPDR in the month of December, making the final month of the year the second consecutive month in which XLB is usually the best sector SPDR ETF. XLB was a solid performer in November, gaining 3.8 percent. Why It's Important The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLI) ranks as the second-best sector SPDR in December, marking the second straight month in which the largest industrial ETF has that honor on a historical basis. XLI averages a December gain of just under 2.50 percent, according to CXO data. Like XLB, XLI is coming off a strong November in which the industrial ETF gained 3.81 percent. What's Next In some months, some sector ETFs historically notch negative performances. Owing to December's reputation for equity market strength, no sector SPDR ETFs average negative returns in the last month of the year. This month's historical “laggards” include the Consumer Staples SPDR (NYSE:XLP), which averages a December gain of just under 1 percent,” according to CXO. XLP, the largest consumer staples ETF, jumped 2.33 percent last month. The Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK), the largest technology ETF, is usually the worst-performing sector SPDR in December, posting a modest gain.

2019-02-04,Best Sector ETFs For February: Let's Get Cyclical,"January was a banner month for stocks as the S&P 500 jumped 8.1 percent. That's a major improvement on the S&P 500's January performances of the past decade. With February here, investors are hoping stocks again belie historical trends. What To Know In the November through April period, the stronger six-month period for stocks, the S&P 500 averaged a February loss of 0.6 percent over the past decade. That means February is, historically, the worst month in the strong six-month frame for stocks. As is the case with any other month, February brings some potentially compelling sector-level opportunities that are easily accessible via exchange traded funds. Some of the sector ETFs that traditionally perform well in the second month of the year are already surging to start 2019. Winners Among the nine original sector SPDR ETFs, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) is the best performer in February. Since 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR lineup, XLB has averaged February gains of around 1.3 percent, according to CXO Advisory. XLB, the largest materials ETF by assets, is off to a solid start in 2019 with a year-to-date gain of 5.1 percent, though that lags the performance of the S&P 500. February is the first of six months in which XLB ranks as either the best or second-best sector SPDR ETF on a historical basis. As for the sector SPDR that usually finishes second behind XLB in February, that honor goes to the suddenly hot Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE). XLE, the largest energy ETF by assets, averages February gains of just over 1 percent, according to CXO data. With Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) having delivered fourth-quarter results last Friday, earnings risk for XLE over the near-term is minimal After ranking as one of 2018's worst-performing sector ETFs, XLE is up 13.1 percent to start 2019 and February marks the start of what is usually the best period of the year for oil prices. Laggards There are some sector laggards in February. The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF) and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU) both average February losses of around 1 percent, according to CXO data. That makes the duo the worst-performing sector SPDRs in the second month of the year. In defense of XLF and XLU, those funds are up 9.4 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, year-to-date.

2019-04-01,Best Sector ETFs For April: Trying Avoid April Showers,"April is upon us and the fourth month is, historically, kind to equities. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 has risen in 75 percent of those Aprils, posting an average gain of 1.7 percent. That ties April with March for the best average monthly performance by the S&P 500. The Gainers At the sector level, the groups that typically perform well in the fourth month of the year are cyclical sectors. The disclaimer is that seasonal trends do not always repeat. Going back to 1999, the first full year of trading for the original nine sector SPDR exchange traded funds, the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) is usually the best sector SPDR ETF in the month of April. XLE, the largest equity-based energy ETF by assets, averages an April gain of almost 4 percent, according to CXO Advisory. XLE is coming off a first quarter gain of more than 15 percent as the energy sector was one of the best-performing groups in the first three months of the year. When first-quarter earnings reports start rolling, XLE will be tested by the usual suspects: Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). The two largest U.S. oil companies combine for 41.71 percent of XLE's weight. The second-best sector SPDR in April, usually, is another cyclical play: the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB). XLB, the largest materials ETF, averages an April gain of just over 3 percent, according to CXO. XLB notched a first-quarter gain of almost 10 percent. Interestingly, April is one of six months in which XLB is either the best or second-best sector SPDR on a historical basis. The Laggards Another interesting tidbit is that, historically speaking, each of the original nine sector SPDR ETFs average April gains. However, there are some “laggards” in the group. That dubious distinction is assigned to the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLP) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK). XLP averages an April gain of just under 1 percent while XLK's average April gain is slightly above 1 percent, according to CXO data. Related Links An Exciting Brazil ETF Call On Convertibles"
2019-05-01,Best Sector ETFs For May: An Interesting Mix,"Investors often believe May brings with it potential downside for stocks, but over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has averaged May gains of 0.30 percent. What comes after May can be trying for investors, particularly in the third quarter, but this month, there are some sector-level opportunities worth considering. The Top Performer Belying May's alleged weakness, each of the original nine sector SPDR exchange traded funds average positive returns in the fifth month of the year, but those performances vary from sector to sector. Perhaps owing to the conservative posture some investors look to adopt in May, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLP) is the best-performing sector SPDR in May. XLP, the largest consumer staples ETF by assets, averages May returns of just over 1 percent, according to CXO Advisory. That's going to back to 1999, the first full year of trading for the sector SPDR ETFs. XLP gained nearly 3 percent in April, extending its year-to-date gain to 13.65 percent. The fund devotes over a quarter of its combined weight to Dow components Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE:KO). Looking to gain an edge in your trading and investing? Look no further than the Benzinga Trading & Investing Summit this June 20 in NYC! Historically, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) is the second-best sector SPDR ETF in May, averaging fifth-month gains of just over 1 percent, according to CXO data. XLK, the largest technology ETF, jumped 6.36 percent in April, extending its year-to-date gain to almost 27 percent. The tech ETF could extend its bullish to start May after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), XLK's second-largest component, reported fiscal second-quarter earnings of $2.46 per share on revenue of $58 billion. Analysts expected earnings of $2.36 per share on sales of about $57.5 billion. On The Other Hand... Usually, the two worst sector SPDRs to own in May are the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), but both ETFs average modest May gains. For its part, XLF gained nearly 9 percent in April, good for one of its best monthly performances in over a year. Investors added $1.39 billion to XLK last month, good for the sixth-best total among US-listed ETFs. Disclosure: The author owns shares of XLF.

2019-05-24,Which Sector ETFs Should You Be Overweight Right Now?,"Volatility is back. After a relatively quiet April, the market got a jolt earlier this month with the sudden escalation in trade war negotiations between the Trump administration and China. The added volatility has been a welcome sign for traders, but another thorn in the side of investors wondering how to best position their portfolios. For ETF investors, the best idea going forward—at least, for the time being—could be to go overweight utilities, real estate, and consumer staples, according to investment research platform Quantamize. According to the platform, which rebalances a model sector ETF portfolio monthly based on its Q-Factor scoring system and thousands of signals from neural networks, this is the ideal sector weighting at this moment: Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU): 18.41 percent Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE): 16.95 percent Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP): 16.77 percent Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE: XLI: 9.13 percent Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB): 9.01 percent Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLV): 8.44 percent Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE): 7.28 percent Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY): 6.17 percent Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK): 5.86 percent Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF): 2 percent According to the platform, “The Quantamize SPDR S&P Sectors Stocks ETFs Q-Folio is a portfolio of US-listed SPDR S&P sector ETFs that uses an advanced form of AI to create a robust diversified portfolio of the SPDR S&P sector ETFs.” A portfolio of these holdings and weightings would have delivered an annualized return of 17.93 percent. Image courtesy of Quantamize Interestingly enough, on an individual basis, the platform has sell recommendations nearly all of the Select SPDR ETFs right now. Only the consumer staples, materials, and healthcare ETFs have a buy signal. Image courtesy of Quantamize But this isn’t about individual ETFs—it’s about how to weight them in a portfolio given the current market dynamics. Of course, a broad-based US sector ETF portfolio wouldn’t want to be overexposed to any one correlation. The challenge in adjusting your exposure is figuring out how the sectors are related to one another. The chart below shows the correlation between each of these sector ETFs: Image courtesy of Quantamize As you can see, there’s a strong relationship among the “defensive” sectors of consumer staples (XLP), real estate (XLRE), and healthcare (XLV). Likewise, the “cyclical” sectors of technology (XLK) and consumer discretionary (XLY) have a strong correlation. Interestingly, the XLK appears to have a strong correlation with industrials (XLI), a pair that most investors would not commonly associate together. The upshot here is that sector outperformance is always changing, and a portfolio optimized to take advantage of these changing relationships will have to be rebalanced on a consistent basis.

2019-06-06,A Sector ETF For Risk Takers,"The materials sector is the smallest sector in the S&P 500 at a weight of just 2.73 percent. As such, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) doesn't garner attention on par with the sector SPDR exchange traded funds tracking the technology, health care or financial services sectors, just to name a few. What Happened Despite the sector's diminutive nature and XLB's tendency to toil in anonymity relative to other sector ETFs, the fund is up 11.54 percent year to date and may present risk-tolerant investors with the opportunity for more upside. In a recent research note, AltaVista Research tagged XLB, the largest materials ETF by assets with a “Speculative” rating. The research firm typically applies ratings of “Neutral,” “Overweight” and “Underweight” to the sector SPDR ETFs, but that does not mean the rating on XLB is bad. AltaVista's “Speculative” rating is reserved for ETFs that are “deeply undervalued but risky.” Why It's Important Risky could apply to XLB and the materials sector over the near term. This is a cyclical sector with export exposure, meaning it can be vulnerable to erosion in the business cycle and another flareup in trade tensions. “A rating of SPECULATIVE is assigned to ETFs with ALTAR Scores in the top quintile (the top 20%) of their category, indicating exceptional appreciation potential,” said AltaVista. “However, often these are narrowly-focused funds or in industries with structural issues, which may also make them very risky.” The $3.37 billion XLB holds 27 stocks with a weighted average market value of $40 billion. Linde Plc (NYSE:LIN) and Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW) are XLB's marquee holdings. What's Next The materials sector and ETFs such as XLB are predominantly driven by chemicals manufacturers, which have exposure to the domestic energy cycle. “Abundant domestic energy is spurring an investment boom among chemical firms which comprise ~70% of the sector,” said AltaVista. “Our rating may overstate the sector's attractiveness due to distortions in financial results and estimates resulting from merger and spin-off activity, though discount valuation multiples versus the market also suggest value. However, earnings forecasts have deteriorated rapidly in recent months as has sell-side sentiment on the sector.” XLB is the only one of the 11 sector SPDR ETFs rated by AltaVista that has the “Speculative” rating.

2019-07-01,Best Sector ETFs For July: Make Some Bank,"Historically, June is unkind to stocks, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average just posted its best June showing since 1938. July is here and with that comes the arrival of another month is usually rough on stocks. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 averages a July decline of 0.6%. What To Know While stocks usually don't set the world on fire in July, 2019 has the potential to be different. On the month's first trading day, market participants were treated to news from the G-20 summit that could set the tone for the rest of the month. At the sector level, many groups actually perform well in the seventh month of the year, but the rub is that gains are usually modest. Seven of the nine original sector SPDR exchange traded funds notch July gains, according to CXO Advisory. Why It's Important Historically, the leader of the sector SPDR ETF pack in July is the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF). The largest financial services ETF averages a July gain of about 1.3%, according to CXO data. XLF is coming off a solid June in which surged 4.51%. On June 28, the financial ETF jumped 1.43% on volume that was nearly 30 million shares above the daily average after the Federal Reserve released the results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, setting the stage for massive buyback and dividend increases among XLF components. After surging 9.65% last month, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) could deliver more upside in July if it lives up to its historical reputation of being the second-best sector SPDR ETF this month behind XLF. XLB averages July gains of just under 1%. The seventh month of the year is one of six in which XLB is either the best or second-best SPDR, according to CXO data. What's Next For investors thinking increased use of air conditioning or the summer driving season are bound to positively impact the energy and utilities sectors in July, that's a tough bet to make. History suggests the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU) are the two sector SPDR ETFs that usually generate negative performances in the seventh month of the year.

2019-09-03,Best Sector ETFs For September: A Leader And A Laggard,"Coming off a rough August in which the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:SPY) finished lower, there may not be any rest for the weary in September because the ninth month of the year is historically rough on stocks. Over the past two decades, the S&P 500 averages a September decline of 1.1%, making the ninth month easily the worst, on average, for U.S. stocks. The Winners With September usually being hard on stocks, it's not surprising there is obvious sector level weakness. Using the original nine sector SPDR exchange traded funds as the benchmarks, just two of those funds historically generate positive returns in the ninth month of the year. Though its September gain averages a modest half a percent, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF) is usually the best-performing sector SPDR ETF this month, according to CXO Advisory. XLF, the largest financial services ETF, is coming off an August in which it lost 2.5% and its decent September reputation could be imperiled if more sell-side analysts warn on declining net interest margins at major money center banks. Investors already endured a spate of such announcements last month, likely explaining why XLF has suffered $2.56 billion in third-quarter outflows. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU), on average, slightly trails XLF in September, making the utilities fund the second-best performer in the ninth month of the year. XLU is coming of an impressive 4% gain last month. XLU's credibility as a winning September sector ETF is probably more credible than XLF's at the moment because investors are showing a taste for low volatility strategies and high dividend fare as interest rates decline. The Laggards With September usually being a tough to be long equities, it may not be surprising that the worst-performing sectors this month are high beta groups. The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) and the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) are the two duds among sector SPDR ETFs in September. XLB and XLK both average September declines of just over 1%, according to CXO data. XLB and XLK lost 2.28% and 1.03%, respectively, in August, underscoring the point these are tariff-sensitive sectors and remain beholden to trade news over the near-term. So if there is some legitimate progress on the trade front, XLB and XLK could easily betray their usually poor September reputations.

2019-10-01,Best Sector ETFs For October: A Good Time For Tech,"October is here and with it arrives the fourth and, historically, a good month for stocks. Over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has averaged October gains of 1.4%. Only March and April, which are tied at 1.7%, average better monthly upside than the 10th month of the year. Big Winner Using the original nine sector SPDR exchange traded funds as the guides, there are some compelling sector-level opportunities in October for several reasons, not the least of which is the fact that each of the nine sector SPDR ETFs average October gains. Averaging an October gain of about 3%, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) is usually the best-performing sector SPDR ETF in the month, according to CXO Advisory data. XLK, the largest technology ETF by assets, is a proxy on two major tech stocks: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as those two names combine for nearly 37% of the fund's weight. October is one fourth of months (January, May and August are the others) when XLK is one of the two best SPDRs. Keep An Eye On... Though it's usually the second-best SPDR in October, the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) merits consideration this month. According to CXO, the largest materials fund averages an October monthly gain of 2%. October marks the start of a three-month stretch in which XLB is either the best or second-best of the sector SPDR ETFs. However, tests lings for XLB's historical tendencies. Among specialty chemicals makers, a key XLB constituency, “two-thirds of companies providing updated sales guidance lowered annual outlooks, largely due to moderating demand amid a challenging macro backdrop and trade conflict uncertainty,” according to Corbin Advisors. Some Laggards October brings tests for some lagging sectors. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLV) is usually the second-worst SPDR in October, but the fund still cobbles together a gain of just under 2% on average. However, the sector has struggled this year. Speaking of struggling sectors, that description fits the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE). XLE, the largest energy ETF, usually averages a modest October gain, which investors will surely take this year given the headwinds encountered by oil stocks in 2019.

2019-11-01,A Pair Of Super Cyclical ETFs For November,"Today is the first day of November. Historically speaking, that's good news for stocks because over the past two decades, the S&P 500 has averaged November gains of 1.2%, making the 11th month of the year the fourth-best in terms of gains for the benchmark U.S. equity gauge. As was noted in this space, November kicks off the best six-month period for stocks and that often includes pronounced bullishness for cyclical sectors. Going back to 1999, the first full year of trading for the original nine sector SPDR exchange traded funds, data confirm that it pays to get cyclical starting in November. Best Of The Best? Case and point: the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), the largest ETF dedicated to that sector is usually the best-performing sector SPDR fund in November. XLB averages a November gain of nearly 3%, according to CXO Advisory data. That's impressive stuff when considering all nine of the original sector SPDR ETFs average positive November returns. XLB is coming off a 4.26% gain in October. But Keep An Eye On... Here's where things get interesting in terms of November sector seasonality. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLI) is usually the second-best SPDR this month, also averaging a gain of just under 3%, according to CXO data. What makes XLI bullishness an interesting proposition for November is that the thesis may have been dealt a blow on news that China is balking at the idea of comprehensive trade agreement. That's problematic for some XLI components, including Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). Still, XLI is coming off an impressive 5.61% October gain, one that was accrued against the backdrop of controversy surrounding Boeing (NYSE:BA) and weak earnings from Caterpillar and 3M (NYSE:MMM). Jingle Bells Normally, we'd look at the worst performers among the SPDRs for November, but since they all generate gains on a historical basis, it may be instructive to peak toward December. That peak is relevant because XLB and XLI also rank as the top sector SPDRs in the last month of the year. November and December are two of six months in which XLB is usually the best or second-best of the sector SPDR ETFs.

2020-01-06,"Best Sector ETFs For January: Energy, Health Care In Focus","With the S&P 500 coming off its performance in two decades last year, expectations are in place that returns are likely to be more subdued this year. If historical trends repeat, that subdued tenor could be seen this month as the S&P 500 averaged a January decline of 0.30% over the previous 20 years. So although January is part of the best six-month period in which to own stocks, the month typically isn't strong in its own right. The tepid nature of January equity market action is reflected at the sector as just five of the original nine sector SPDR exchange traded funds average gains in the first month of the year. A Standout As for solid sector performers in January, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLV) stands out as the best performer of the original nine sector SPDR ETFs. XLV, the largest health care ETF, averages a January gain of around 1%, according to CXO Advisory data. Last year, XLV gained 20.4%, trailing the S&P 500, which rose 31.2%. January is one of four months in which XLV ranks as one of the best sector SPDRs, notes CXO. See Also: 6 Market Predictions For The Next Decade What Else? Keeping with the theme of last year's sector laggards having good January reputations, there is the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE). The S&P 500 almost tripled up on XLE last year, but the energy fund is the second best SPDR in January, averaging a first-month gain of just under half a percent, according to CXO. Depending on what happens with Iran over the near-term, XLE could get a lift, particularly if rising oil prices make their way to Dow components Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Those stocks combine for over 40% of XLE's weight. January is one of three months in which XLE is one of the top two sector SPDRs with February and April being the others, according to CXO. What To Avoid? As for the sector SPDR ETFs history says to avoid in January, the Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF) averages a January decline of almost 1%, but that doesn't make it the worst of the bunch. That dubious distinction belongs to the Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), which averages a January drop of just over 1%, notes CXO. XLB lost 2.72% last week, so it could be preparing to live up to its glum January precedent. That said, there are four months of the year in which XLB is one of the two best SPDRs, including February. Disclosure: The author owns shares of XLF."
2020-02-02,4 Sector ETFs To Mull Over In February,"February is here and after a trying end to January, some market participants may not be excited about the arrival of the second month. The month may be known for romance, but on a historical basis, it's not great for stocks. Although February resides in the strongest six-month period in which to own stocks, the S&P 500 has averaged a loss of 0.3% in the second month of the year over the past two decades. Of course, there will be sector-level opportunities this month, but buyer beware. Using the original nine sector SPDR exchange traded funds as gauges, a fair amount of those well-known ETFs average losses in February. With that in mind, here are some of the sector SPDRs to keep up with this month. Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) With oil coming off its worst January performance in 30 years, sending the Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) lower by 11%, it may seem surprising that XLE is being included. That may be a sign that investors ought to resist historical trends this month. The reason being is that the energy's sector best seasonal stretch starts in February and XLE is usually the second-best among the original nine sector SPDR ETFs this month, according to CXO Advisory. The largest equity-based energy ETF has averaged a February gain of just over 1% since its first full year of trading in 1999, according to the research firm. See Also: 3 Nifty Apple ETFs Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB), like XLE, presents a potential riddle for investors in February. According to CXO data, XLB is usually the best-performing SPDR in February, averaging a gain of 1.5%. However, the largest materials ETF, like its energy counterpart, is combing off a brutal January in which it lost almost 6.2%. In other words, if January trends linger into this month, trusting either XLB or XLE to live up to historical billing in February could be trying on investors. Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) It's interesting that in a month where the S&P 500 averages a loss that a defensive sector, such as utilities, would also be a historical loser. However, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU) does average a modest February loss, making it the second-worst SPDR in the second month of the year. However, this is a script that could be flipped this year because XLU enjoyed a banner January, jumping almost 7%. Perhaps more importantly, XLU's components are entirely focused on the U.S., meaning no coronavirus/China exposure. Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF) is usually the worst of the sector SPDR ETFs in February, averaging a decline of just over 1%, according to CXO data. That makes February one and the first of four months in which the largest financial services ETF places as one of the two worst sector SPDRs. Like XLU, XLF's components have heavy domestic focuses and that could be a benefit if the coronavirus continues commanding headlines. Disclosure: The author owns shares of XLF."
2020-04-29,Todd Gordon's XLB Trade,"On CNBC's Trading Nation, Todd Gordon of Ascent Wealth Partners suggested a bullish options trade in Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB). For traders who want to accumulate XLB shares, he suggested a risk reversal strategy. He would sell the June $52 put and buy the June $57 call for a total of $2.10. The trade starts to lose money at $49.90. If the stock stays above $52 at the June expiration, he would collect $2.10 and he is going to make additional profit, if it trades above $57. If it trades below $52, he is going to have to buy it at that price."
2020-07-20,Carter Worth And Mike Khouw's XLB Trade,"On CNBC‘s Options Action, Carter Worth spoke about Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB). He said the ETF outperformed the energy sector, financials and the industrials since the March low and year to date. Worth also showed a bullish wedge pattern and he sees the potential of a breakout above the resistance so he wants to take a long position in XLB. Mike Khouw said the largest constituents of XLB are already trading at new highs so he wants to use call options to limit losses in case of a pull-back. Calls also allow him to participate on the upside, in case the break out actually happens. He wants to buy the September $62 calls for $2.25. The breakeven for the trade is at $64.25 or 5.05% above the closing price on Friday. His exposure is 3.68% of the Friday‘s close."
2020-08-03,2 Sector ETF Winners And 2 Duds For August,"August isn't the worst month of the year for stocks. It's not the best one, either. Over the past 20 years, the S&P 500 averages an August loss of 0.20%. The benchmark U.S. equity gauges averages a loss in five months of the year and the August loss is the lowest of those five. At the sector level, August is like any other month: there are winners and losers. However, the eighth month of the year requires investors be choosy because just three of the nine original sector SPDR exchange-traded funds average gains this month. Here are the top two sector SPDRs, on a historical basis, in August, followed by the two worst laggards. Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) The Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) averages a modest August, but it's enough to make the leader of the sector SPDR pack, according to CXO Advisory data. XLK is coming off a 5.51% gain in July and, as usual, its fortunes this month will boil to scorching hot Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Those stocks combine for about 43% of XLK's weight. August marks the start of an interesting three-month stretch in which XLK is the best sector SPDR before becoming the second-worst in September only to be the best again in October. Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU) posts a small August gain. XLU's historical August bullishness jibes with the conservative posture many investors look to take during the slow summer months. The fund, the largest utilities ETF, jumped 5.33% last month and yields 3.44%, which is meaningful in today's low yield environment. XLU may be worth holding on to because it's also the second-best SPDR in September. Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) averages an August loss of about half a percent, but things could be different for the largest materials ETF this year because it's coming off a July gain of almost 7%. On the other hand, XLB is also one of the two worst sector SPDR ETFs in September, indicating this is a risky seasonal period for the ETF. Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) The Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) averages an August loss of almost 1%, according to CXO. If that historical form holds true, that would actually qualify as a decent month in 2020 for XLE. The fund lost 2.44% last month following an almost 4% loss in the last week of July. XLE is now down 40% this year."
2020-08-17,3 ETFs For The Suddenly Marvelous Materials Sector,"It's tied with energy for the smallest weight in the S&P 500 at 2.57%, but the oft-overlooked materials sector is on the rise. The S&P 500 Materials Index gained almost 1.5% last week and enters Monday trading at its highest levels since late 2017. While there are plenty of indications that the sector is undervalued, that status isn't the only reason the group is being bid higher. Depressed Treasury yields — which are stirring inflation speculation — and rising commodities are fueling renewed interest in the sector. Here are three materials exchange traded funds for investors to consider in the search for more near-term upside. Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) is the largest ETF tracking this sector and is higher by 3.26% over the last month. XLB also enters Monday trading less than 1% below its 52-week high. Owing to a shallow pool of large-cap candidates for this sector, XLB has just 28 holdings and is top-heavy, as Linde Plc (NYSE:LIN) accounts for more than 18% of the fund's weight. XLB's top 10 holdings combine for almost two-thirds of the fund's weight. Fun fact: XLB is either the best or second-best sector SPDR ETF in four months of the year. VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF (MOO) The VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF (NYSE:MOO) is higher by almost 8% over the past month and is closing in on all-time highs. The ETF turns 13 years old at the end of this month. MOO follows the “MVIS Global Agribusiness Index (MVMOOTR), which is intended to track the overall performance of companies involved in: (i) agri-chemicals, animal health and fertilizers, seeds and traits, from farm/irrigation equipment and farm machinery, aquaculture and fishing, livestock, cultivation and plantations (including grain, oil palms, sugar cane, tobacco leafs, grapevines, etc.), and trading of agricultural products,” according to VanEck. MOO is interesting in the current environment because agricultural commodities are historically inflation fighters, and an equity approach is a practical play on what's usually a volatile asset class. Invesco S&P SmallCap Materials ETF (PSCM) With small-cap stocks in rally mode, adventurous investors may want to give the Invesco S&P SmallCap Materials ETF (NASDAQ:PSCM) a look. While PSCM is higher by 17% over the past month, making it the best-performing member of the trio highlighted here, it also has the furthest to run back to its 52-week high.

2020-08-31,"4 Sector ETFs For September, Including A Pair Of Surprises","September is here and with the arrival of the ninth month of the year comes some ominous equity market history. While October gets the bum rep as a brutal month for equities, the S&P 500 averages a September decline of 0.80% over the past two decades, making it the worst month of the year for benchmark domestic equity gauge over that period. Making September all the more tricky to navigate is the limited amount of sector-level upside opportunities. In fact, just two of the original nine sector SPDR exchange-traded funds average September gains. Let's look at that pair and the two worst offenders here. The Good... Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF) The Financial Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLF) is usually the best-performing member of the sector SPDR suite in September, averaging a gain of just over half a percent, according to CXO Advisory. Owing to historically low interest rates, financial services is one of the worst-performing sectors in the S&P 500 this year and that's highlighted by XLF's 2020 loss of 17.61%. The worm could be starting to turn for financial services ETF as it enters the last trading day of August up 5.58% over the past month. September is one of three months in which XLF is either the best or second-best of the sector SPDRs. Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) Speaking of low interest rates, the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLU) is an example of an ETF that should benefit from low borrowing costs due to the cost-intensive nature of the utility business. XLU, the largest utilities ETF, is the second-best sector SPDR in September, averaging a gain of close to 0.50%, according to CXO. Despite the aforementioned low rates, XLU is a disappointment this year, slumping 8.59%. That's likely the result of markets favoring more adventurous fare, namely technology and communication services stocks. September is one of four months in which XLU is one of the top two sectors SPDRs. ...The Bad Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) Believe it or not, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) is usually the second-worst of the sector SPDRs in the ninth month of the year, averaging a loss of roughly 1.50% in the last month of the third quarter. Time will tell, but thanks to the strength of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which combine for 45.72% of XLK's weight, it's hard betting against XLK these days. Especially when it's higher by more than 14% over the past month. Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) is an egregious September offender, averaging losses of just over 2% in that month. Fun fact, September is the only month in which one of the original nine sector SPDRs averages a loss of 2% or more and XLB is home to that dubious honor. Things could be different this year as XLB enters September off a 6% August gain and residing near all-time highs."
2020-10-02,4 Sector ETFs For October: Rely On Tech,"In terms of financial market seasonality, October is an interesting month. The tenth month is known to have given birth to some of the most dramatic market declines, but over the past two decades, the S&P 500 averages October gains of 1.2%. That's good for the fourth-best average of the 12 months. Of course, this year could be different because this October is the run-up to one of the most anticipated presidential elections on record. At the sector level, October brings plentiful opportunities because of the original nine sector SPDR exchange-traded funds, each one averages positive returns. What follows is a look at two of the best and two of the worst sector SPDR ETFs in the tenth month of the year. Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) Up 28.65% year to date, the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLK) is one of the best sector SPDR ETFs again this year and it averages October gains of nearly 3%, according to CXO Advisory data. Fun fact about XLK: For the all excitement and impressive returns the technology sector generates, October is just one of two months – August is the other – in which XLK is one of the two best sector SPDRs. Per usual, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) chart the course for XLK because those stocks combine for 44% of the fund's weight. Materials Select Sector SPDR (XLB) The Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) is usually the second-best sector SPDR in October, averaging a gain of almost 2% in the tenth month of the year, according to CXO data. The largest materials ETF was a decent performer in the third quarter and its September decline was less than that of other sectors. However, XLB needs a combination of cyclical uplift and investors rotating to value names to trade higher over the near-term. If that happens, XLB can continue its tradition of being the best SPDR in November and December... maybe. Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) The Health Care Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLV) is usually the second-worst sector SPDR in October, though it averages almost half a percent. XLV's October lethargy can likely be attributable to the sector's status as a politically sensitive one and the month's proximity to Election Day. And those traits are likely among the reasons why analysts have recently been souring on health care equities, weighing on ETFs like XLV last month. Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) The Energy Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) is usually the worst-performing sector SPDR in October, though it averages a modest gain in the tenth of the year. Don't bet on that history repeating this month. XLE is lower by 18% over the past month, price action that suggests what many already know: the energy sector is a weak group in a weak place."
2021-01-07,7 'Blue Wave' ETFs To Buy Following Democrat Senate Victories,"The Democratic “blue wave” in Washington D.C. took two months longer than many investors had anticipated, but it arrived this week when Democrats narrowly eked out a majority in the Senate. Following the Georgia runoffs, investors are once again searching for the best stocks and ETFs to own under Democratic leadership. Inflation And Rising Rates: Bank of America analyst Jared Woodard discussed several ETF ideas for investors looking to play the blue wave trade. “As we argued last fall, unified government clears the path for big fiscal packages to drive growth, inflation and bond yields higher,” Woodard wrote in a note. The biggest themes investors should consider are cyclical and value stocks that should benefit from rising inflation rates and stimulus-driven economic growth. Woodard said energy stocks, clean energy stocks and materials stocks should all benefit from rising inflation rates. He recommends ETFs such as the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE), the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NYSE:ICLN) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB). Related Link: 6 Key Economic Projections For 2021 In addition, Woodard said a steepening yield curve should be good news for the bank ETFs such as the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE:KBE). For investors looking for a more diversified financial sector play, the First Trust Financials AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE:FXO) is the financial sector fund with the highest weighting of bank stocks. Infrastructure And Technology: Infrastructure spending may be one of the Joe Biden administration’s top priorities, and Woodard said the Invesco S&P 500 Eql Wght Industrials ETF (NYSE:RGI) is the industrial ETF with the highest exposure to construction stocks. Finally, Woodard recommends investing in technology ETFs that have relatively low exposure to the FAAMG group due to antitrust concerns. He recommends the First Trust Technology AlphaDEX Fund (NYSE:FXL), in which the FAAMG stocks have just a 4% weighting. Benzinga’s Take: While the Republican party is typically seen as the party of big business, the stock market has performed very well throughout history under Democratic leadership. Since 1948, the S&P 500 has averaged a 14% annual return during years in which Democrats control the White House and both houses of Congress."

2021-06-15,Survey: Hedge Fund Managers Aren't Worried About Inflation,"Investors are eagerly anticipating the U.S. Federal Reserve’s updated economic projections expected out Wednesday. Inflation is at the forefront of many investors minds at the moment, but the latest global hedge fund manager survey from Bank of America suggests fund managers aren’t particularly concerned about inflation. Inflation Concerns: The Consumer Price Index climbed 5% in May, its highest growth since 2008. However, the Fed has said it expects high inflation levels in 2021 to be “transitory” as the economy opens up to full capacity. Some investors are skeptical that recent inflation levels are transitory, but 72% of fund managers surveyed agreed that the current inflationary situation is only temporary. In fact, 68% of managers surveyed said it should be smooth sailing for the economy in the next couple of years and don’t expect another recession until 2024 at the earliest. Related Link: 2 Reasons To Stay Overweight On The Financial Sector But just because inflation is not a concern doesn’t mean fund managers aren’t expecting action from the Fed in the near term. About 63% of managers surveyed said they expect the Fed to signal a tapering of its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases in August or September. Current Allocations: Cash levels among fund managers have dropped from 4.1% to 3.9% in the past month, and 57% of managers surveyed said any near-term correction in the stock market will ultimately be less than a 10% pullback. Allocation to bonds is currently at a three-year low, while stock allocations are at year-to-date highs. Bank of America found long commodities has also overtaken long Bitcoin (CRYPTO: $BTC) as the trade fund managers consider to be the “most crowded” at the moment. Despite a belief that the commodity trade is crowded, it is also the most aggressive overweight allocation among fund managers relative to historical levels. Fund managers are also overweight materials and banks and underweight bonds and utilities. Benzinga’s Take: To mimic fund managers’ current allocations, consider buying the Invesco Optimum Yld Dvsfd Cmd Str No K-1 ETF (NASDAQ:PDBC), the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB) and the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (NYSE:KBE) and selling the iShares Core US Aggregate Bond ETF (NYSE:AGG). Investors who want to take the contrarian approach and bet against hedge funds should take the opposite side of that trade. (Photo: Kalhh via PIxabay)"

2021-07-12,Understanding Materials Select Sector SPDR's Unusual Options Activity,"Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) shares experienced unusual options activity on Monday. The stock price moved up to $83.17 following the option alert. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-08-20 Strike Price: $83.00 Volume: 803 Open Interest: 319 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Out of the money contracts are unusual because they are purchased with a strike price far from the underlying asset price. Out of the money occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. Buyers and sellers try to take advantage of a large profit margin in these instances because they are expecting the value of the underlying asset to change dramatically in the future. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Strategies To Trade Options Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-08-10,Unusual Options Activity Insight: Materials Select Sector SPDR,"Shares of Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) saw some unusual options activity on Tuesday. Following the unusual option alert, the stock price moved up to $85.1. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: PUT Expiration Date: 2021-08-27 Strike Price: $81.00 Volume: 1543 Open Interest: 2 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Trading Options With These Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2021-08-12,Analyzing Materials Select Sector SPDR's Unusual Options Activity,"On Thursday, shares of Materials Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLB) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $85.88. Sentiment: BEARISH Option Type: TRADE Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-09-17 Strike Price: $86.00 Volume: 727 Open Interest: 2746 Three Signs Of Unusual Options Activity One way options market activity can be considered unusual is when volume is exceptionally higher than its historical average. The volume of options activity refers to the number of contracts traded over a given time period. The number of contracts that have been traded, but not yet closed by either counterparty, is called open interest. A contract cannot be considered closed until there exists both a buyer and seller for it. The trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future is another sign of unusual activity. Generally, additional time until a contract expires increases the potential for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important in this context because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts with a strike price far from the underlying price are also considered unusual because they are defined as being out of the money. This occurs when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made because the underlying asset value is expected to change dramatically in the future, and the buyer or seller can take advantage of a greater profit margin. Bullish And Bearish Sentiments Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock.

2021-08-23,Is Now the Time to Buy These 6 Undervalued Materials Stocks?,"After a hot start to 2021, concerns over the delta variant of COVID-19 have weighed on materials sector stocks in the past three months. In fact, over that time, the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB) has a negative total return of 2.8% compared to a positive total return of 7.2% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY). Assuming the economic reopening will once again get back on track at some point, there could be some attractive value opportunities within the materials sector to buy on the dip. Here are the six S&P 500 materials sector stocks with the lowest forward earnings multiples, according to Finviz. LyondellBasell Industries NV (NYSE:LYB) LyondellBasell is a major U.S. producer of petrochemicals, including Olefins & Polyolefins. LyondellBasell’s costs are linked to natural gas prices, and its selling prices are correlated to oil prices. The stock’s total return in 2021 is just 9.2%, lagging both the S&P 500 and the materials sector as a whole. Its forward earnings multiple is just 6.5, lowest in the entire S&P 500 materials sector. Analysts have high hopes for a rebound in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 22 analysts covering LyondellBasell is $118, suggesting 18.1% upside from current levels. See Also: Expert Panel Talks China, Inflation And The Importance Of A Stock Selection Process Mosaic Co (NYSE:MOS) Mosaic produces and distributes crop nutrients, including phosphates and potash. Mosaic has actually bucked the trend in the materials sector this year and has generated a total return of 34% year-to-date. Even after its strong performance, the stock still has one of the lowest forward earnings multiples in the sector at just 7.8. Looking ahead, analysts are expecting even more upside for Mosaic in the next 12 months. The average price target among the 19 analysts covering the stock is $39, suggesting 23.8% upside from current levels. Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE:FCX) Freeport-McMoRan is the world’s largest public copper producer. Like Mosaic, a strong copper market has helped Freeport generate an impressive 26.5% total return year-to-date. However, the stock’s 9.1 forward earnings multiple suggests there is still plenty of potential valuation upside for investors. Analysts covering the stock certainly seem optimistic the rally can continue. The average price target among the 15 analysts covering Freeport is $44, suggesting 28.8% upside from current levels. Dow Inc (NYSE:DOW) Dow is a global chemical company that has lagged its materials peers and the S&P 500 so far in 2021, generating a 12% total return year-to-date. Value investors may like the stock’s forward earnings multiple of 10 and its attractive 4.5% dividend. The 20 analysts covering the stock have an average price target of $68.5, suggesting 10% upside for Down over the next 12 months. CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CF) CF Industries is another materials sector stock with significant exposure to the agricultural industries. The company is the largest North American producer of nitrogen fertilizers. CF shares have generated a total return of around 17% this year-roughly in line with the materials sector as a whole. The stock’s forward earnings multiple of just 10.1 might make the stock an attractive buy for value investors. The 17 analysts covering CF have an average price target of $60, suggesting 33.4% upside over the next 12 months. Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) Supply shortages have sent steel prices soaring in 2021, and steel producer Nucor has been along for the ride. Nucor shares have generated a total return of 120.9% year-to-date leaving all the other materials stocks mentioned in the dust. Still, analysts are expecting big earnings numbers to continue for Nucor in coming quarters, and its forward earnings multiple remains just 10.6. The nine analysts covering Nucor are expecting some consolidation following the big move. Their average price target is just $110, suggesting 9% downside from current levels."

2021-09-08,This Model Suggests Negative S&P 500 Returns Over The Next Decade,"Bank of America has updated its S&P 500 price target for year-end 2021 and released its brand new year-end target for 2022. Unfortunately, the firm’s new estimates paint an extremely conservative picture of the next 16 months. Limited Upside: On Wednesday, Bank of America analyst Savita Subramanian raised her year-end 2021 S&P 500 price target from 3,800 to 4,250. The new target still represents about 5.9% downside from the S&P 500’s current level of around 4,517. Looking ahead to 2022, Subramanian set a new year-end S&P 500 target of 4,600, suggesting only about 1.8% additional upside for the index over the next 16 months. She said the S&P 500 EPS is up about 50% from its COVID-19 trough, yet the stock market has doubled. She also pointed out that investor sentiment is at its most bullish levels since 2007, a potentially bearish contrarian indicator for stock prices. Related Link: 'Worrisome Combination': Experts React To Disappointing August Jobs Report In addition, Subramanian said inflation is weighing on margins, interest rate risk is at a record high and stocks appear to be priced for perfection. While Bank of America is bullish on the U.S. economy in coming years, Subramanian said about half of the S&P 500 returns since 2010 have been driven by Federal Reserve balance sheet expansion rather than earnings growth. Economists now expect the Fed to begin tapering its monthly asset purchases by the end of 2021. Historically High Valuation: Subramanian said an end to monthly Fed asset purchases and then eventual asset sales “could end badly” for the stock market. In fact, the firm’s long-term valuation model now suggests negative overall returns for the S&P 500 over the next decade. “Canaries are chirping – PPG, a barometer of industrial activity, aborted guidance on supply chain woes; credit spreads have stealthily widened, and our valuation model (~80% explanatory power for S&P 10yr returns) now indicates negative returns (-0.8% p.a.) for the first time since ‘99,” Subramanian wrote in a note. For now, she recommends investing in inflation-protected yield and small-cap stocks. Subramanian also recommends stocks in sectors that benefit from inflation, such as the energy, financial and materials sectors. Benzinga’s Take: If investors trust the Bank of America long-term valuation model, S&P 500 index funds like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) will likely drift sideways at best for the next 10 years.

2022-02-15,What The Fed's Balance Sheet Reduction Will Mean For The S&P 500,"The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) is off to a shaky start to 2022, down 5.1% year-to-date. Investors are rightfully concerned about the potential for Federal Reserve interest rate hikes starting as soon as March, but history suggests the Fed's plan to begin reducing its balance sheet could be even more of a bearish catalyst for stock prices than rising rates. Balance Sheet Expansion: The Federal Reserve's balance sheet roughly doubled in size to an unprecedented $9 trillion during the pandemic thanks to aggressive monthly bond and mortgage-backed security purchases. That buying has contributed to elevated inflation levels and high stock market valuations. The Fed has hinted it will begin its quantitative tightening process in the near future, but the last time the Federal Reserve sold assets, it didn't go well for stock market investors. Prior to the financial crisis in late 2008, The Fed held less than $1 trillion in assets on its balance sheet. From Sept. 15, 2008 to Jan. 15, 2015, the Fed increased its balance sheet holdings to $4.51 trillion. During that same stretch, the S&P 500 gained 65.7%. The Fed began its balance sheet normalization process in October 2017, allowing bonds to mature without reinvesting the repaid principal into new securities. That process continued through Aug. 26, 2019, reducing the Fed's balance sheet to around $3.76 trillion. During that previous stretch of tightening, the S&P 500 gained just 12.1%. Related Link: US Adds 467,000 Jobs In January: 'Good For The Economy, But Not For Markets' Sector Performance: Some sectors of the market struggled during the previous tightening period more than others. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU) more than doubled the S&P 500's return during the previous tightening period, generating a total return of 30.6%. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) was also a top performer, generating a total return of 27.9%. On the other end of the spectrum, the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) generated a negative total return of 23.3% during quantitative tightening, while the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB) generated a negative total return of 6.3%. Growth and dividend stocks outperformed during the period. The Vanguard Growth Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VUG) generated a total return of 22.7%, while the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VIG) produced a 24.2% total return. Small-cap stocks and value stocks underperformed during the previous balance sheet run-off. The Vanguard Value Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VTV) generated just a 9.8% total return, while the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF (NYSE:VB) generated an 8.1% total return. Benzinga's Take: The biggest difference between the upcoming Fed tightening cycle and the previous one may happen if the Fed actually sells assets rather than simply letting them mature and run off naturally. Asset sales could drain bank balance sheet liquidity and potentially pressure both the credit market and stock market valuations, according to Credit Suisse."

2022-09-12,This Is What To Expect From The Q3 Earnings Reporting Season,"The S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) 3rd quarter earnings reporting season is fast approaching and it's time to start preparing for what could be a very bad season. While there are some glimmers that inflation has peaked it's still high, biting into the bottom-line outlook, and compounded by supply chain problems both old and new. Those companies which still have strong businesses are having a hard time meeting the demand because of supply chain constraints while the weaker businesses are faced with a bloated inventory. The takeaway is the outlook for earnings and earnings growth is weakening and not expected to get any better with the FOMC on track to hike rates by another historic 75 basis points. The Outlook For Earnings Growth Is Worse Than It Seems The outlook for earnings has been in decline for the last two months, which is bad enough on its own, but there are some underlying details that make the situation worse than it appears. At face value, the consensus estimates for Q3, Q4, and the full year ticked lower to new lows over the past two weeks. The outlook for Q3 is now only 3.6% compared to the high of 11.6% set earlier this year. The consensus has fallen a full 800 basis points in that time and is on track to hit 0% by the start of the reporting season. This makes only the second reporting season since the pandemic bottom in which the consensus is falling and the pace and depth of the decline accelerated from the previous quarter. The consensus for the 4th quarter has fallen less than the 3rd quarter outlook but that will likely change as the 3rd quarter reporting season wears on. As it is now, the Q4 consensus is 4.9% which is down 310 basis points from its high. Assuming the Q4 consensus falls in tandem with the current trends it is highly like that Q4 of 2022 will produce negative earnings growth and that is not good for S&P 500 index prices. The only ray of light in the outlook data is that consensus for C2023 ticked higher over the past two weeks but don't read too much into that. With the consensus for C22 in decline, the uptick in expectation for C23 is a function of this year's weakness and not next year's strength. On a sector basis, the news is even worse. The consensus estimate for ten of the eleven S&P 500 sectors is in decline and only 4 are expected to show growth. Of those, only the Energy Sector (NYSE:XLE) is seeing upward revisions and even here the pace of revision and expectation for growth is down from the previous quarter. More importantly, three of the most important sectors for the Q4 outlook are seeing massive downward revisions that have the Consumer Staples (NYSE:XLY), the Materials (NYSE:XLB), and Communication Services (NYSE:XLC) sectors all looking at negative growth for the quarter. The S&P 500 Technical Outlook: Nothing Bullish About It The weekly chart of the S&P 500 is showing an interesting technical setup because it highlights the largest flaw in technical analysis; the technical indicators and the signals they give are cold. That means that a buy signal and a sell signal often look identical which is the situation we have today. The index is set up in a way that could lead to an upside move but it is easy to read bullishness in the charts because most investors are bulls, not bears. In the context of the economic conditions and the dominant technical signals driving the market today, however, the index appears to set up a big fall that could easily take it down to a new low. The dominant technical signal is a long-term Head&Shoulders Reversal Pattern that has been in play since December of last year. This pattern was not only confirmed with a drop below the 4,100 to 4,300 level but it was reconfirmed not once but twice with follow-on declines from that same level. So, the S&P 500 is in a relief rally and the chart looks like it could be set up for a move higher but resistance appears to be far stronger than support. Resistance can be counted at the 4,100 – 4,300 range which is a previous support level, the baseline of the H&S Pattern, a resistance point that was confirmed once, twice, three times and is now coincident with the 30 and 150-day EMAs. This combination, coupled with the expected earnings weakness, will not allow price action to move above 4,300 without a change in the fundamental outlook and there are few chances of that. The best-case scenario is that earnings for the broad S&P 500 will be better than expected and come with a favorable outlook for margins if not revenue growth. In that scenario, the index would likely move higher but it is far too soon to bet on that outcome now. If the index is going to move higher there will be a better signal than the one it's showing.

2023-03-20,"Nasdaq, S&P 500, Dow Move Higher On Central Bank Liquidity Boost: Analyst Says Potential Relief Rally On Horizon","The risk mood on Wall Street recovered Monday, with major equity indices posting gains. Some of the positive sentiment is attributable to the coordinated action announced by five of the world’s biggest central banks to ease liquidity strains. Cues From Past Week’s Trading: Stocks closed the week ended March 17 mostly higher despite the volatility seen amid the continuing news flow on the banking crisis. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite indices recorded weekly gains of 1.43% and 4.41%, respectively, while the Dow Industrials in which financial stocks have over 15% weighting edged down 0.15%.

Issues at Credit Suisse AG (NYSE:CS) also simmered through the week, which culminated in a Swiss National Bank-brokered deal to be bought by peer UBS Group Inc. (NYSE:UBS) over the weekend.

Drawing inspiration from historical performance, the analyst noted that whenever 20% or more of S&P 500 stocks reached oversold levels as seen last week, the average return over the following three months was 4.2%, outpacing the average three-month return of 2% during the timeframe. “A breakdown below 3,783 would raise the odds for a retest of the October lows and trigger a bearish signal in the December Low indicator,” he added. According to Wedbush analysts led by Daniel Ives, technology stocks are behaving as a safety blanket trade that may have more room to the upside.

2023-04-21,S&P 500 Headed To Weekly Losses After Five Straight Wins As Investors Fear Higher Rates For Longer,"The stock rally that began in the middle of March appears to have stalled, with investors taking profits on the back of renewed rate concerns following upbeat economic data. The S&P US Manufacturing and Services PMIs came in above forecasts in April, indicating a resurgence of pricing pressures and pushing U.S. Treasury yields higher on Friday. The broad market S&P 500 Index traded flat in midday trading on Friday, and is set to conclude the first week in the red after five straight advances. Fed futures now almost fully discount a 25-basis-point hike in May. Investors assign a 70% likelihood for rates to stay unchanged at 5-5.25% in June. Bets for the first Fed rate cut to occur in September were further trimmed, with markets now assigning a less than 50% probability, according to the latest CME Group Fedwatch tool. Cues From Friday's Trading: Stocks traded in a tight range on Friday, as traders digested mixed earnings reports and macro data prints. Major equity indices opened lower and then attempted a rebound into noon trading. The S&P 500 Index was marginally weaker, down 0.07%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 eased 0.2% while both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Russell 2000 were flat on the day. U.S. Indices' Performance On Friday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq 100 -0.18% 12,984 S&P 500 Index -0.07% 4,128 Dow Industrials -0.01% 33,779 A recession now looks like a foregone conclusion, said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, citing the decline in the leading indicators index to the levels last seen in November 2020 when the economy was contending with the COVID-19 pandemic. “Historically, an economic contraction has closely followed a decline in the LEI of this magnitude,” the economist said. The head fake from last year’s two quarters of negative economic growth and the uncertainty from an aggressive Federal Reserve were likely culprits for pushing down the markets last year. The good news, however, is that Roach does not expect the markets to retest those lows despite the likelihood of a recession later this year.

2023-05-12,3 Worst-Performing Sectors: Which Stocks Are Dragging Returns During Debt Ceiling Crisis?,"The U.S. stock market got off to a shaky start in May. The S&P 500 index, closely tracked by the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSE:SPY), is poised to end its second consecutive week of losses for the first time since mid-February as the debt-limit stalemate weighed on sentiment. As of May 12, all eleven S&P 500 sectors have fallen month to date, with some sectors failing more significantly than others: Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE), down 7.3% Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLF), down 4% Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB), down 3.7%. Chart: Worst-Performing Sectors versus SPY - Month-To-Date Performance Why Are Energy Stocks Falling In May? The fundamental cause for the energy sector's poor performance in May was the sudden drop in oil prices, rather than the Congress stalemate over the debt ceiling. Oil dropped 8.6% in the first two weeks in May, with a barrel of WTI-grade crude falling to $70. Which Stocks Caused The Energy Sector's Drop? Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE:XOM) sank 9.64% month to date, dragging the XLE down by 2% in May. Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) fell 7.2% in May, pushing the sector ETF down by 1.5%. Marathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE:MPC) plummeted 10.5% in May, driving the sector ETF down by 0.45%. Why Are Financial Stocks Falling In May? The crisis that hit smaller banks in March and led to the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic has left some scars on financial stocks. Concerns around the state of the economy and the debt ceiling standoff have also weighed on banking stocks' performances in May. The University of Michigan just reported a sharp drop in the preliminary estimates of consumer sentiment for May. Yhe Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund was among the worst performer for the day, only after the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY). Which Stocks Caused The Financials Sector's Drop? PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) was the worst contributor for the sector's performance, falling nearly 20% month to date, and pushing alone the XLF down by 0.5% in May. Bank of America Corp. (NYSE:BAC) plummeted 9% in May, dragging the sector ETF down by 0.4%. U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) sank 15.4% in May, pushing the sector ETF down by 0.2%. Why Are Materials Stocks Falling In May? The main industry dragging the performance of the materials sector in May was metal and mining. Excluding gold, growth-related metals fell across the board in May, with copper and silver both down by about 5% as the Chinese growth momentum weakened. Which Stocks Caused the Materials Sector's Fall? Freeport-McMoran, Inc. (NYSE:FCX) was the worst contributor for the sector's performance, tumbling nearly 10% month to date, and pushing alone the XLB down by 0.6%. The Mosaic Company (NYSE:MOS) cratered 22% in May, dragging the sector ETF down by 0.4%. Corteva Inc. (NYSE:CTVA) fell 8.4% in May, pushing the sector ETF down by 0.3%.

2023-05-26,"AI, Macro And Mega Trends: How To Sort Out The Big Picture","This is a part of a transcript of a conversation between Jeff Black, VP of Content and Education at Tornado, and his guest John Normand, in March 2023. John is a cross-asset strategist who spent over 25 years at JP Morgan heading research for foreign exchange, international rates and commodities. He was also head of cross-asset strategy. The following is not investment advice and all views John expresses are his own. What Is “The Macro”? Macro, or economy-wide influences, can be broken down into cyclical and structural factors. Cyclical influences are those that ebb and flow over horizons of maybe one month to one or two years. These include the rate of overall GDP growth, the rate of inflation, and the level and volatility of interest rates, exchange rates and commodities prices. They also include political risks and opportunities presented by elections, and geopolitical risks presented by international conflicts. Structural influences unfold over 5, 10 or 20 years. These are allegedly less sensitive to what occurs over the business cycle. (I will return to this point about sensitivity later in the podcast.) These are generally mega trends that relate to technological disruption, climate change, globalization and de-globalization, demographics and economic development. How Does Macro Influence Stocks? Not all of these factors are material for every company and every equity sector. But for an equity investor to formulate a complete view of opportunities and risks, it’s important to know which macro issues matter, and to track them alongside company fundamentals. The cyclical sectors — Materials - that’s included in the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB), Industrials, Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLI), Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY) and to some extent Energy, Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) are highly geared towards the rate of global growth and interest rates. The opposite holds for Defensive sectors. These could include Utilities, Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU), Staples, Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP) and Healthcare, Healthcare Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLV). Technology, Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) and Communication Services, Communications Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC) are in the middle. They may benefit from structural mega trends like technological disruption. Yet they tend to be harmed by de-globalization (if it happens quickly) and rising interest rates. The challenge for stock investors is figuring out what broad forces matter for their stocks, and then netting these factors against company-specific fundamentals. What About The Business Cycle? There is also a pronounced difference in equity performance in particular business cycle environments. For example, during an earnings recession, a period in which corporate profits growth is negative but the economy overall is growing and unemployment is stable, the S&P might experience a 10% to 15% peak-to-trough drawdown. During a broader GDP recession, in which GDP growth is contracting and unemployment is rising by at least 1 percentage point, the equity drawdown may be about twice as large (25% to 30%). These intra-year losses may not matter to a long-term investor since stocks tend to rise in about 8 of 10 years. But for a more tactical investor who relies on trading profits to fund other activities (like their consumption), these sorts of moves are quite material and may be worth trying to time.

2023-06-01,"US Stocks Rebound, Dollar And Treasury Yields Decline As Traders Reassess Fed Policy And Welcome House Approval Of Debt Ceiling Bill","The U.S. stock market rallied on Thursday, as traders revised down their expectations for a Fed rate rise in June, after more dovish-than-expected comments by Fed members in the past days. According to Jefferson, the Fed is expected to keep interest rates steady in June in order to better assess the economic outlook. Harker, who is also a member of the FOMC, echoed his comments, adding, I think we can take a bit of a skip for a meeting. Meanwhile, investors welcomed the approval of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 by the House of Representatives by a vote of 314-117. The measure has been sent to the Senate and is quite likely to pass before the June 5 default date. On the macro front, the labor market continues to show indications of tightness, with ADP reporting a 270,000 job rise in May, much above the projected 170,000, ahead of tomorrow's crucial nonfarm payroll data. Cues From Thursday’s Trading: The major averages were all in the green on Thursday, with small-cap and technology leading the way. The Russell 2000 gained 1.2%, the Nasdaq 100 up 1.1%, the S&P 500 up 1%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 0.8%. U.S. Indices' Performance On Thursday Index Performance (+/-) Value Nasdaq 100 +1.2% 14,418.29 S&P 500 Index +0.99% 4,219.83 Dow Industrials +0.76% 33,122.27 Analyst Color: A June swoon may be in the cards for the broader U.S. equity market, said Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial. While the S&P 500 continues to struggle with resistance at 4,200, overbought conditions have become widespread across the technology sector, he noted. Turnquist said the tech sector, which has a 28% weighting in the S&P 500 Index, has been responsible for most of the index gains this year. “While overbought conditions provide validation of the tech sector’s uptrend, and overbought does not mean over, probabilities for a temporary consolidation and/or pullback appear to be growing,” the analyst said. If there is mean reversion, it would likely be toward the sector’s uptrend and provide a potential pullback opportunity for investors seeking a better entry point into tech, he added. Thursday's Trading In Major U.S. Equity ETFs: In midday trading on Thursday, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.9% higher to $421.78, the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) rose 0.6% to $331.56 and the Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) was 1% higher to $351.65, according to Benzinga Pro data.

2023-07-05,"US Stocks Slip, Treasury Yields Rise Ahead Of Fed Minutes: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?","Stocks eased on Wednesday as investors took a more cautious stance prior to the release of the Fed minutes for the June 14 meeting. The minutes are expected to reveal that the committee broadly agrees that additional interest rate hikes are required to combat inflation.

The yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds approached 3.9%, the highest level since March 10, effectively returning to levels prior to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

The release of a healthy ADP employment number raised investor expectations that the Federal Reserve may resume interest rate hikes and perhaps extend them beyond the summer. With 497,000 new jobs added in June, above May’s result of 267,000 and predictions of 228,000, concerns are growing that the Fed will become more hawkish. In reaction, traders revised their estimates for future Fed rate hikes, assigning an almost certain probability to a July boost and a roughly 50-50 chance of another hike by November. Furthermore, the most recent FOMC minutes revealed an unusual level of dissent among participants, increasing concerns that more hawkish members may acquire power over the board. As investors await Friday’s job market report, which will reveal June nonfarm payrolls (expected to be around 225,000) and the unemployment rate (expected to be 3.6%), many expect the data will confirm stronger-than-expected job market performance, following the impressive ADP National Employment Report.

The bottom line with equities is that caution is warranted given the impressive rally we have experienced in the first half of the year,” said Brian Price, Commonwealth Financial Network's head of investment management. The analyst sees geopolitical risks continuing. We are not out of the woods when it comes to inflation, he said.

2023-07-19,"Stocks Extend Gains, Dow Tops 35,000, Dollar Rebounds: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?","U.S. stocks are continuing their rally Wednesday, with the S&P 500 index on track for its seventh positive session in the last eight, reaching levels last seen in early April 2022. The Dow crossed the 35,000 milestone, on track for its fourth straight session of gains. Strong earnings remain the driving force behind the stock market, while investors eagerly await quarterly results from Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM) and United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NYSE:UAL), all of which are scheduled to report after the closing bell. The market is now entering a light week in terms of macroeconomic releases, with only the S&P Global Flash PMI on Monday being in the spotlight before the pivotal event of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting on Wednesday, July 26. A lower-than-expected U.K. inflation rate, combined with increased speculation that the ECB may stop raising interest rates after July, created pressures in both the euro and the pound, fueling a rebound in the U.S. dollar index. Cues From Wednesday’s Trading: After officially entering a bull market on Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to outperform other U.S. major averages on Wednesday, rising 0.4% for the day. The S&P 500 Index gained 0.3%, while the Nasdaq 100 inched 0.1% higher. Small caps in the Russell 2000 edged 0.2% higher.

The results on the surface probably won't offer much to write home about given consensus estimates imply a 7% year-over-year decline in S&P 500 earnings per share, said Jeffrey Buchbinder, chief equity strategist, and Quincy Crosby, chief global strategist. “However, the key question is always what's priced in, which at least offers an opportunity for markets to react positively.” LPL's best guess, according to the analysts, is “typical upside surprises and guidance reductions,” giving this rally a convenient excuse to take a breather. Carson Group's Ryan Detrick, who is in the bullish camp, noted a historical trend that is positive for the market. The Russell 2,000 Index, comprising of small-cap stocks, had a gold cross technical move, i.e. the 50-day simple moving average crossing over above the longer-term 200-day moving average. This has happened 17 times in history and the market was higher three months later all the 17 times, BeSpoke's analysis showed, Detrick tweeted. Russell 2k recently had a Golden Cross (50-day MA moved above the 200-day MA).According to @bespokeinvest this has happened 17 other times in history.

In August, the Producer Price Index surpassed expectations, following a Consumer Price Index report that was also higher than anticipated.

Retail sales among U.S. consumers outstripped forecasts in August, marking a positive streak of five consecutive months of growth. China made a significant announcement by enacting a 25-basis-point reduction in the reserve requirement ratio for all banks, a move poised to inject much-needed liquidity into the country’s economically challenging situation.

2023-09-25,Morgan Stanley Strategist Advocates Defensive Stance As Market Dynamics Shift,"Morgan Stanley equity strategist Michael Wilson has a cautious outlook for the U.S. stock market, underlining a preference for defensive sectors. In a note released Monday, Sept. 25, Wilson pointed to the resurgence of defensive sectors’ outperformance, while cyclicals and growth sectors have recently faced headwinds. This caution stems from weakening momentum in discretionary spending, with consumers depleting their pandemic savings buffers and facing the impact of rising interest rates. Utilities, Health Care, and Consumer Staples have caught the analyst’s attention due to their compelling valuations. Wilson highlighted that Utilities trade at an attractive forward price-to-earnings ratio of around 16 times, while Consumer Staples is at a ratio of approximately 19 times.

Wilson points to multiple factors putting pressure on the Consumer Discretionary sector, including slowing consumer spending, the resumption of student loan payments, rising delinquencies in certain household cohorts, higher gas prices, and concerning data from the housing sector. Although Tech and Consumer Discretionary have secured the second and third spots for the best-performing sectors year to date, Wilson emphasized the current fragility of market breadth. Only about 30% of stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, and just half of the stocks in the index are in positive territory for the year. S&P 500 Outlook Wilson maintains a bearish stance on the stock market throughout 2023, which has so far proven to be inaccurate.

2023-10-04,"Yield Curve Inversion May Not Predict Recession, But Analyst Says Too Early To Declare 'All Clear' On Downturn","Merrill, a Bank of America company, has thrown a curveball, challenging the traditional wisdom surrounding the predictive power of the U.S. yield curve inversion for recessions. In Merrill’s latest Capital Market Outlook, penned by Joseph P. Quinlan, managing director and head of CIO market strategy, Merrill Lynch takes a bold stance on the U.S. yield curve and the outlook for 2024. The inversion of the U.S. yield curve, calculated as the yield differential between a 2-year Treasury note or the fed funds rate and the 10-year Treasury bond, has been in effect since July 2022. Historically, every U.S. recession since 1970 has been foreshadowed by a yield curve inversion, granting this metric enormous predictive value. To validate this, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York‘s recession probability model employs the yield curve’s slope, also known as the “term spread,” to estimate the likelihood of a U.S. recession occurring 12 months into the future. However, in a world where the U.S. economy has defied expectations, weathering sharp Federal Reserve (Fed) rate hikes with surprising resilience, staying calm in the credit markets, and pushing the S&P 500 Index forward, the historical link between an inverted yield curve and impending recessions finds itself under scrutiny, according to Quinlan. Steeper Yield Curve Benefits Bank Lending Activity As the analyst argues, researchers have long recognized that the shape of the U.S. yield curve carries valuable insights into the economic outlook. When short-term yields exceed long-term yields, it has historically provided early warnings of impending recessions, while steep curves have heralded robust early-cycle rebounds in economic activity. Quinlan goes further to assert that the correlation between the yield curve spread and bank lending appetite five quarters later highlights the link between the curve and subsequent economic activity. Steeper yield curves, associated with higher term premiums, bolster bank profits and the supply of bank loans, as institutions engage in the critical activity known as maturity transformation, the bedrock of their business. In stark contrast, a yield curve inversion spells reduced bank lending and, consequently, headwinds for growth. Currently, the spread between the 10-year Treasury yield, resting at 4.70%, and the 2-year Treasury yield, hovering at above 5%, stands at approximately negative 34 basis points, the lowest level since March 2023, after rising from the lowest value (100 basis points) in over four decades. US Yield Curve’s Slope: 10-Year Yield Minus 2-Year Yield The Outlook For 2024 Looking ahead to 2024, Merrill warns of a “significant risk of a potentially meaningful increase in unemployment over the next year.” This caution is grounded in the understanding that it takes approximately a year for a drop in bank lending appetite to manifest as an economic slowdown. However, the investment bank emphasizes that this uptick in unemployment unfolds within an economy still grappling with labor shortages across multiple sectors, including construction, semiconductors, truck drivers, manufacturing, and others. In other words, the rise in unemployment may fall short of levels seen in the past, offering a silver lining in these uncertain times. “There are multiple crosscurrents working through the economy, which, is a $26 trillion hydra-headed beast that remains the most competitive and dynamic in the world. Yes, it is too early to declare all clear to the risks of recession,” Merril wrote. As per equity sector views, Merrill is bullish on the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLV), while bearish on the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY). Additionally, the firm favors overweights in the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLU) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE). Conversely, it leans towards underweights in the Real Estate Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLRE) and the Materials Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLB).

2023-10-05,Stocks On Shaky Ground As Traders Tread Lightly Ahead of Friday's Jobs Data: What's Driving Markets Thursday?,"Risk aversion returned on Thursday as stocks retraced their gains from Wednesday. Traders are now closely monitoring the eagerly anticipated non-farm payrolls data set to be unveiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. By midday trading in New York, not a single S&P 500 sector registered gains, underscoring the overall prevailing weak sentiment in the market. Treasury yields exhibited relatively low volatility, and the U.S. dollar experienced a marginal decline. On Thursday, two Federal Reserve speakers shared their insights. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said the market’s expectations for interest rate hikes in both November and December seem reasonable, emphasizing the importance of not prematurely declaring victory against inflation. Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin commented that interest rates may appear elevated at the moment, but he believes they are not excessively high in the long-term perspective. Cues From Thursday's Trading: The S&P 500 fell 0.6%, while the Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.8%. Blue-chip stocks were 0.5%, same as small caps in the Russell 2000.

U.S. exporters and multinationals could take a big hit from the development, the analyst said. Higher oil prices increase the costs of companies and a stronger dollar makes their products less competitive in the global markets. Higher oil prices also mean pain at the pump, eating into the discretionary spending of consumers, she said. These dynamics have the potential to challenge corporate profits at a time analysts have been boosting their U.S. corporate earnings forecasts, Shalett said. Morgan Stanley now anticipates 12% annualized growth through 2025, she added. “Higher expectations, in the face of mounting risks, may amplify the degree of potential disappointment and related market volatility,” the analyst said. Thursday Trading In Major US Equity ETFs The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 0.6% lower to $422.05. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (NYSE:DIA) fell 0.44% $329.47.
