2019-04-22,The Difference Between Finding Momentum And Chasing It,"Spring is in full swing and I’m beginning to emerge from a truly horrendous March after a couple of weeks of solid, by-the-books trading. Of course, it hasn’t been easy. I mentioned last week how the lack of momentum has stymied any massive winning trades. However, this week I want to focus on a recent trade in a stock that did have a strong bout of momentum, Reebonz Holding Ltd. (NASDAQ:RBZ), which jumped about 280 percent in the morning session and got halted six times on its way up. Even though I entered my first position at $11 when it first got halted, I unfortunately didn’t pounce on the full move from $8 to its peak above $27, though I did make a healthy $1,400. Congratulations to anyone who did manage to make the most of that massive move. But, in my case, there are a variety of reasons why I wasn’t more aggressive on RBZ, one of which was how delicate the charts have been in some of these rocketing stocks this year. The primary reason I didn’t pursue RBZ was that it would have required me to break a whole host of my own rules around chasing a stock that could have reversed the moment I stepped on the gas. There’s a full breakdown of the trade in my recap for that day, but I’ll spend a few words here explaining how I approach momentum and why, for every RBZ I might miss, there are dozens of other instances of saving myself from a $10,000, or even $20,000, loss. First, although RBZ had many of the characteristics of a stock I would trade—low float, trading below $10, with a history of big moves—the stock wasn’t trading on any news. While that didn’t disqualify it, the setup became less compelling as the amount of risk I would have to take on climbed with the price. Recall, I recently had one of my worst trading days ever because I jumped into a stock without any news to carry it higher. The second reason I didn’t continue pressing RBZ was, coming out of scalping the second circuit-breaker halt, I was simply on edge about buying into a third. In most cases, stocks that enter more than two halts going up generally don’t continue without some heavy consolidation after the third. The fact that RBZ made it to six before falling back down reveals how unique it really was. Finally, the main factor as to why I didn’t put the pedal to the floor in RBZ was because I ultimately would be chasing the trade, which is generally just bad practice. Of course, I’ve chased in the past, and sometimes it’s worked out perfectly. Many other times it hasn’t, and right now I am trying to stick to the fundamentals of trading and remain consistently green. Which is why, instead of chasing RBZ, I looked for a sympathy play in Castor Maritime (NASDAQ:CTRM) which I netted $11,500. The difference between the two? I could manage my risk CTRM, but not in RBZ. Proof positive that the old saying “smarter, not harder” works for trading as well. Warrior Trading is a content partner of Benzinga"

2019-05-21,"More Ship Owners Eye Wall Street Via Direct Listings, Not IPOs","Golar LNG Ltd. (NYSE:GLNG) has confirmed plans to spin off its liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier business into a separate public vehicle, signaling the entry of yet another player into an already very crowded field. Despite a total collapse in the industry's initial public offering (IPO) prospects, Wall Street's shipping cadre keeps expanding as more owners opt for the ‘direct listing' path popularized by Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), wherein shares become tradable but no proceeds are raised. Before market open on May 21, Golar reported a net loss of $41.7 million for the first quarter of 2019, compared to a net loss of $21 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA of $63 million came in well above analyst consensus forecasts of $53 million. The company, which is led by Norwegian businessman Tor Olav Trøim, the former right-hand man of shipping magnate John Fredriksen, has increasingly diversified away from LNG shipping into areas such as floating liquefaction (FLNG) and the power sector. Golar LNG disclosed in its earnings announcement, At its recent meeting in Bermuda, the board made a decision to proceed with a spin-off of the company's TFDE [tri-fuel diesel engine] LNG carrier business, subject to satisfactory market conditions, and to focus the company's future activities primarily around FLNG and downstream assets. The announcement also stated, This will allow LNG shipping investors more direct exposure to the shipping market and reposition Golar's core business toward LNG infrastructure on long-term contracts. Golar is in talks with other owners of similar tonnage to join the new shipping company. Golar did not disclose the timing of the new listing. Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Snyder commented in a client note, While details around the spin-off are sparse, we expect Golar to take advantage of tightening LNG shipping markets and seasonal strength later in the year to dispose of the fleet at a solid price. Golar's plan for a new LNG-shipping-only public entity coincides with plans for another direct listing in the same sector – by Fredriksen's Flex LNG. Flex LNG was formed in 2006, went public on the Oslo Axess Market in 2009, transferred its shares to the Oslo Stock Exchange in 2017, and filed a registration in April with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed NYSE listing. It currently has a fleet of four LNG carriers and has nine newbuildings on order. These two pending LNG shipping entrants follow a number of other direct listings by owners in other segments. The last successful shipping IPO was for Gener8 Maritime in June 2016; that company was sold to Euronav (NYSE:EURN) in 2018. Unsuccessful shipping IPO attempts were made last year by GoodBulk and Navios Containers. Owners have instead opted for the non-IPO direct listing route. Those taking this path include TORM Shipping (NASDAQ:TRMD), a Copenhagen-listed product tanker owner that began trading in the U.S. in December 2017; South Africa's Grindrod Shipping (NASDAQ:GRIN), which obtained a U.S. listing in June 2018; Navios Containers (NASDAQ:NMCI), which listed directly in December 2018 after its IPO plan flopped; Castor Maritime (NASDAQ:CTRM), a tiny Greek company that listed in February on NASDAQ with a fleet comprised of a single 15-year-old bulker; and the most significant direct lister to date – Diamond S Shipping (NYSE:DSSI) – which unsuccessfully pursued an IPO in 2014, listed directly in March, and is now one of the largest tanker owners in the U.S. public market. More are likely to follow. Several other companies are said to be waiting in the wings for U.S. direct listings, including owners already trading in Oslo. This isn't how shipping's Wall Street footprint was supposed to play out. Investment bankers speaking at ship-finance conferences over the past decade repeatedly voiced the hope that the number of U.S.-listed companies would be whittled down, and that the survivors would be larger-market-cap, blue-chip entities that would command respect among institutional investors. They had hoped that the barriers to successfully pricing an IPO would limit new entrants and eventually render the playing field less muddled. But the direct listing trend has quashed that prospect. At least in the short- and medium-term, there are clearly going to be more U.S.-listed ship owners, not fewer. Image sourced from Pixabay"

2019-06-18,John Fredriksen-Backed Flex LNG Makes Spotify-Style NYSE Debut,"The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has just welcomed another ship owner aboard. On June 17, the stock of liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier owner Flex LNG began trading in the U.S. Its executives rang the opening bell and the stock closed up 2 percent on its debut day. Flex LNG had been previously listed on the Oslo stock exchange; it will now be dual-listed. There has not been a U.S. initial public offering (IPO) by an ocean shipping company since June 2015, due to a lack of investor interest. Ship owners are sidestepping this hurdle by doing so-called ‘direct listings,' a concept popularized by Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), in which the stock begins trading but no money is raised. With the direct listing, we did not have any underwriters or any financial advisors, just some lawyers filing the registration statements. It has been a swift process for us to get on the stock exchange in the U.S, says Oystein Kalleklev, CEO, Flex LNG. Speaking at the Marine Money conference in New York on June 17, Flex LNG chief executive officer Oystein Kalleklev highlighted the relative speed, cost and ease of the direct listing process versus an IPO. With the direct listing, we did not have any underwriters or any financial advisors, just some lawyers filing the registration statements. We did a confidential filing with the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] in April. They didn't have many comments, and we did a public filing in May, and now we are trading in June – so it has been a very swift process for us to get on the stock exchange in the U.S. The company's largest shareholder is billionaire shipping tycoon John Fredriksen, the richest man in Norway. Other Fredriksen-backed public shipping companies include Frontline (NYSE:FRO), Ship Finance International (NYSE:SFL) and Golden Ocean (NASDAQ:GOGL). Flex LNG raised $329 million through an equity private placement in 2017 and another $300 million in an equity private placement last year. We did not really need to raise any more equity [through a U.S. IPO], said Kalleklev, adding that the Spotify direct listing provided the blueprint. The company has four LNG carriers that were built in 2018, another newbuilding that delivered this month, another to be delivered in August, five newbuildings scheduled for delivery in 2020, and two for delivery in 2021, for a total initial fleet of 13 LNG carriers. The ships it has on the water are on fairly short-term contracts, he explained. Management believes that the market is gradually tightening and there will be better opportunities for longer-term charters down the road. He said that the LNG shipping market has evolved from one that was almost exclusively based upon very long-term charters that supported bank financing to a market featuring much shorter contracts. Given that shorter contracts will not secure the same level of debt financing, he said that the new incarnation of LNG shipping will require more equity financing. The arrival of Flex LNG marks the third ship owner to secure a U.S. listing this year, despite the dearth of IPOs. Diamond S Shipping (NYSE:DSSI) did a direct listing in March and Castor Maritime (NASDAQ:CTRM) listed in February. At least one more is in the queue – Golar LNG (NYSE:GLNG) has confirmed definite plans to spin off its LNG shipping division from its other businesses. Two public companies have announced intentions to privatize and withdraw from the public market in 2019 – DryShips (NASDAQ:DRYS) and Teekay Offshore (NYSE:TOO) – but overall, the total number of listed ship owners continues to rise.

2019-08-19,Will Other Listed Ship Owners Privatize After DryShips' Exit?,"It's official – DryShips (NASDAQ:DRYS) has agreed to go private, heralding the end of a sometimes-controversial 14-year stretch as one of ocean shipping's highest-profile listed entities. The broader industry question in the wake of privatization plans of DryShips and Teekay Offshore (NYSE:TOO) is whether slumping stock prices will prompt more public players to throw in the towel. DryShips announced on August 19 that it had approved a definitive offer from founder George Economou to buy the remaining shares of DryShips he doesn't already own for $5.25 per share. An initial offer by Economou of $4 per share was proposed on June 13. There are currently 86,886,627 outstanding shares of DryShips, with 72,421,515 or 83.35 percent owned by entities controlled by Economou. Economou will now pay $75.9 million for the final 16.65 percent, up 31 percent from the $57.9 million offer made back in June. The deal was accepted by the board after the unanimous approval of a special committee of independent directors. The special committee received financial advice from investment bank Evercore. Legal firm Seward & Kissel represented DryShips, led by led by partners Gary Wolfe, Nick Katsanos and Ted Horton and counsel Andrei Sirabionian. A good deal for shareholders? The initial offer by Economou was criticized as too low compared to the company's net asset value (NAV), defined as the market-adjusted value of the fleet plus other assets, minus debt and other liabilities. How does the new, approved offer stack up versus NAV? U.K.-based VesselsValue provided FreightWaves with valuations of DryShips' fleet as of June 13, estimating that the company's ships were worth $827.7 million. Using that figure in lieu of DryShips' fleet book value, assets totaled $1.084 billion (as of March 31) and liabilities totaled $374 million, implying an adjusted equity value of around $710 million, according to the latest available information. DryShips founder George Economou. Photo courtesy of Capital Link The original June offer equated to a total equity value of $347.5 million, 51 percent below the adjusted equity value. The August 19 offer comes in at $456.2 million, 36 percent below it. That said, shipping stocks in general, particularly those with exposure to the dry bulk sector, are widely trading well below NAV. If an overall sector is trading at a discount for an extended period, is it necessarily unfair to non-insider shareholders to sell out at a discount to NAV? Viewed in comparison to DryShips' actual stock pricing, the offer is at a premium. The June 13 offer was 27 percent above the closing price on June 12. The new offer is 66 percent above the June 12 closing price and 37 percent above the August 18 closing price. When asked by FreightWaves for comment on the transaction, J. Mintzmyer, lead researcher at Value Investor's Edge, replied, George Economou is taking the company private at a steep discount to fair market value, but the purchase price seems to be in line with peer valuations. He continued, This is indicative of the extreme undervaluation we're seeing in the sector. More privatizations may follow Mintzmyer warned, If markets don't shape up, we might see a few more transactions like this in the near- to mid-future. Asked about the possibility of more privatizations given low stock valuations, Stifel analyst Ben Nolan told FreightWaves, Theoretically, it makes sense to be private if the value of the company is worth less in a public format than it is privately, and it does not seem as though that dynamic [low stock valuations] is likely to change in the foreseeable future. Nolan further explained, If the companies have no prospect of a public valuation in excess of that in the private market, it makes no sense to remain public. The DryShips privatization deal will likely mark the second departure from the U.S.-listed shipping ranks this year. In late May, Teekay Offshore received an offer from Canada's Brookfield Business Partners to purchase all remaining common units in the partnership it did not already own. That offer is currently under consideration. Throughout 2019, stocks of ocean shipping companies have been whipsawed by the U.S.-China trade war. Investor sentiment on these stocks is clearly linked to the news cycle on that issue, regardless of the extent individual public owners are exposed to that particular trade. If U.S.-China tensions are not resolved before the next U.S. presidential election in November 2020, shipping stocks could face an ongoing and prolonged sentiment headwind. Low equity valuations are leading to lack of access in U.S. capital markets. According to data compiled by FreightWaves from public filings, U.S.-listed ship owners have raised only $589 million through August 19, compared to $3.2 billion through that date in 2018. The shipping sector is also experiencing a sharp drop-off in coverage by leading Wall Street analysts. The past few months have seen high-profile departures of shipping analysts at Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo. Recent quarterly calls by listed companies have been noticeably shorter because so few analysts are left to ask questions. It is possible that some of the smaller ship owners that have extremely low trading liquidity will decide that the costs of being public outweigh the benefits, and privatize. Jefferies shipping analyst Randy Giveans is skeptical, however. He told FreightWaves, I doubt that many more public companies would go private, although more should, mainly because ship owners who have gone through the process of going public enjoy being listed and having the optional access to public capital if the situation arises. Additionally, there aren't many public companies that are majority-owned by an insider/founder. Another counter-argument is that despite the privatization offers for DryShips and Teekay Offshore and persistently low stock valuations, the number of U.S.-listed shipping companies is actually increasing. Ship owners are unable to acceptably price initial public offerings, but they can still go public without raising money through so-called ‘direct listings,' as has been done this year by Flex LNG (NYSE:FLNG), Diamond S Shipping (NYSE:DSSI) and Castor Maritime (NASDAQ:CTRM), and as is expected to be done shortly by the spin-off by Golar LNG (NYSE:GLNG). Potential legal challenges The privatization of DryShips is not technically a done deal until it closes, which is scheduled to occur in the fourth quarter. However, it is hard to foresee any outside forces strong enough to derail it. The transaction requires a majority of stockholders to approve the deal at a yet-to-be-scheduled special meeting, but Economou owns five-sixths of the shares. The only way the deal could be blocked is if minority shareholders successfully sued to halt it. Legal action is currently underway to block of the Teekay Offshore deal. DryShips and Economou have repeatedly been targeted by lawsuits and investigations over the past decade – but so far, they have always prevailed in court. According to the company's latest quarterly filing and court documents, suits remain active in U.S. district courts in Texas and New York as well as in the Marshall Islands. An investigation also remains ongoing by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into stock offerings done in 2016-17, according to DryShips' latest quarterly filing. The unusually high volume of shareholder suits DryShips and Economou have faced throughout the company's history implies at least one rationale for going private – theoretically, less money will have to be spent on legal representation going forward.

2019-09-23,Ocean Shipping On Wall Street: The Sound Of Silence,"If you're an owner in ocean shipping, you can hear the crickets on Wall Street. The pullback of activity in the U.S. capital markets this year has been staggering. Many of the equity analysts that covered ocean shipping at U.S. investment banks are no longer at those jobs. The question-and-answer periods at the end of quarterly conference calls have become very short because few analysts are left to pose questions. Shipping executives are compensating by spending more time filling out their conference calls by reading lengthy scripts about market conditions. The ultimate embarrassment, which is no longer particularly uncommon for public ocean shipping companies, is when the chief executive officer finally opens the call to questions – and there aren't any. Just crickets. Proceeds raised by U.S.-listed shipping companies from equity and debt offerings are at historic lows as the third quarter of 2019 draws to a close. Capital-raising activity is so low in New York that Norway – a far smaller market in terms of average deal size – could conceivably overtake the U.S. in terms of gross shipping proceeds by year-end. Before 2019, Norway has never been even close. How bad is 2019? According to an analysis of public securities filings by FreightWaves, U.S.-listed ship owners have raised an aggregate of $598.9 million in gross proceeds since the beginning of this year, putting 2019 on pace to be the worst year ever for shipping proceeds since the industry came to Wall Street in the early 2000s. U.S.-listed companies raised almost $3.5 billion in proceeds in the first nine months of 2018, almost six times more than this year's take. To put this into further perspective, 2018 was actually a bad year for ocean shipping capital-raising. Full-year proceeds for U.S.-listed owners in 2018 totaled $3.98 billion, less than half the $8.17 billion raised in 2014. The situation is particularly abysmal for sales of common equity, given sentiment headwinds from trade tensions and recessionary fears. In 2019, there have been just two very small offerings totaling a mere $24.3 million, done by micro-cap Greek-sponsored companies: bulker owner Seanergy (NASDAQ:SHIP), which grossed $14.3 million in May, and product-tanker owner Top Ships (NASDAQ:TOPS), which has priced and is closing a $10 million deal now. In both cases, equity was sold with warrants attached and the offerings have been highly damaging to the stock price. By this time last year, U.S.-listed ship owners had raised $348.2 million from common-equity sales, over 14 times the current year-to-date total. U.S.-listed shipping companies raised $648.2 million from common-equity sales in full-year 2018, their worst full-year performance since the sector started to go public in the early 2000s. There have been no shipping initial public offerings (IPOs) in the U.S. market since June 2015, although companies continue to list in America via so-called ‘direct listings' in which no money is raised from equity sales. Shipping direct-listers year-to-date include tanker owner Diamond S Shipping (NYSE:DSSI), liquefied natural gas (LNG) carrier owner Flex LNG (NYSE:FLNG) and dry bulk micro-cap Castor Maritime (NASDAQ:CTRM). At least one more direct listing, a spin-off of Golar LNG (NASDAQ:GLNG), is expected by the end of this year. The majority of Wall Street shipping deals in 2019 – as was the case last year – have been sales of debt securities or hybrid securities, not equity. Bulker owner Globus Maritime (NASDAQ:GLBS) raised $5 million in March through a convertible note. In May, tanker owner Teekay Corp (NYSE:TK) raised $250 million through a private placement of senior secured notes; mixed-fleet owner Ship Financial International (NYSE:SFL) raised $80.5 million through the sale of Norwegian bonds; and LNG carrier owner GasLog Ltd (NYSE:GLOG) grossed $75 million via the sale of senior notes. Tanker owner Euronav (NYSE: EURN) raised $50 million in June through the sale of unsecured senior notes, and in July, dry bulk owner Eagle Bulk (NASDAQ:EGLE) raised $114.1 million from the sale of convertible bonds. Norwegian capital markets Oslo, Norway has traditionally been the quieter, less charismatic little brother to Manhattan in terms of shipping capital-market finance – but it's growing up fast. There have been roughly the same number of shipping capital-market deals in Oslo year-to-date as in New York, although aggregate proceeds are still lower because Norwegian deals are done in smaller chunks. Klaveness Combined Carriers has raised $40 million, the Navig8 Group $100 million, the Hunter Group $79 million, 2020 Bulkers $70 million, Epic Gas $60 million, Western Bulk $15 million, Belships $8.8 million and Okeanis Eco Tankers $15 million. Capital-markets proceeds of Oslo-listed or Norwegian-over-the-counter-traded companies year-to-date (excluding ferry, offshore and investment-company deals) total $398 million. If you switch the Norwegian bonds of U.S.-listed Ship Finance International onto the Norwegian side of the ledger, Norway is within just $40 million – or a deal or two – of overtaking the U.S. market by year-end, which is not inconceivable given how terrible sentiment is toward shipping in New York. During an interview with FreightWaves in August, Epic Gas chief executive officer Charles Maltby commented on capital-market dynamics in general and the specific appeal of the Oslo market. The capital markets are correctly punishing shipping in a brutal way and you can't blame them because it's difficult to find a beacon of profitability in the entire shipping sector, he said. There was hyper-investment in the sector as a whole in 2012-14, and it'll probably take 10 years to unwind. Regarding the appeal of Oslo, he explained, We've found investors here to be very knowledgeable on the shipping space and there's an underlying interest in shipping in Norway and a legacy of banks, lawyers and investment advisors who are familiar with shipping. Asked by FreightWaves about the theory that some issuers favor Oslo capital-raising because it is cheaper and more efficient than in New York, at least for smaller sums, he replied, I think that's spot on. We find the costs here very manageable. When you raise equity here, the transaction costs are in the hundreds of thousands, not the millions.

2020-07-27,Robinhood's Topsy-Turvy Top 10 Shipping Stocks,"Retail stock traders have taken center stage this year, embracing speculative bets that institutional investors have shunned. How does this trend affect ocean shipping equities? One indicator is stocks owned by customers of the highly popular Robinhood platform. Robinhood discloses how many of its users own each stock at any given time. This data is downloaded daily and measured over time by Robintrack.net. FreightWaves sifted through the Robintrack database and the Robinhood disclosures and picked out the leading shipping equities. The result is a very, very different Top 10 list than you'd get from institutional investors. #10 — Scorpio Tankers The Robinhood lineup starts out on normal footing with Scorpio Tankers Inc. (NYSE:STNG). Scorpio is the largest public product-tanker owner. It attracts significant institutional investor interest and garners buy recommendations from several sell-side analysts. Scorpio Tankers stock was owned by 5,849 Robinhood users as of Monday. (The data does not show the total number of shares owned, just the number of owners.) (All charts courtesy of Robintrack.net) Robinhood buyers piled into these shares starting in the second half of April. Back then, talk of floating storage upside was rampant. The pitch was that plunging oil prices would force buyers to store oil on ships, filling up vessel capacity, because production could not be switched off fast enough to keep up with coronavirus-induced demand destruction. WTI crude went negative for the first time ever on April 20. On April 24, Nordic American Tanker Ltd (NYSE:NAT) CEO Herbjorn Hansson appeared on Jim Cramer's CNBC show Mad Money. Late April was the peak for many shipping stocks, with pricing and volume pulling back thereafter. But the Robintrack data shows Robinhood users continued to increase their exposure to Scorpio Tankers until late May. They've held steady since — despite the fact that Scorpio's stock price has lost half its value since late April. #9 — Euronav Euronav NV (NYSE:EURN) is the largest listed crude-tanker owner, with a market cap of $2 billion and a strong following among analysts and institutional investors. As with Scorpio Tankers, there's no surprise Euronav is on the list. The surprise is that it's ranked only ninth. As with Scorpio, ownership didn't really jump until the last week of April. The number of Robinhood owners of Euronav stock increased through late June. As of Monday, 5,903 Robinhood users owned Euronav stock. Daily trading volume in Euronav shares is down and the stock price has fallen 30% since late April. Yet the number of Robinhood owners remains near peak levels. #8 — GasLog Ltd. GasLog Ltd. (NYSE:GLOG) is one of the world's largest owners of liquefied natural gas (LNG) carriers. The company, founded by shipping magnate Peter Livanos, has a market cap of $250 million. LNG shipping has been hard-hit by the coronavirus effect on oil pricing. Lower oil pricing cuts production of both oil and gas, while gas-price weakness can erase arbitrage-induced transport opportunities. GasLog's share price began its slide in mid-January and hasn't recovered. It's down two-thirds since then. Robinhood users owning GasLog tripled in a single day: April 20, the day WTI went negative — which was actually a bearish development for GasLog. The number of Robinhood users who own GasLog has stayed near its peak. As of Monday, 6,825 Robinhood users owned GasLog stock. #7 — DHT DHT Holdings Inc (NYSE:DHT) is a pure-play on the very large crude carriers (VLCCs, tankers that carry 2 million barrels of crude oil). It is well regarded by analysts, has an $826 million market cap and has time charters in place to hedge against falling spot rates as floating storage deals unwind. The Robinhood ownership pattern for DHT is familiar. Traders came in toward the end of April and ownership has remained high since peaking in late May. There were 11,621 Robinhood owners of DHT stock as of Monday, despite the fact that DHT shares have shed a third of their value since late April. #6 — Frontline Tanker owner Frontline Ltd (NYSE:FRO), founded by shipping magnate John Fredriksen, has long been a darling of retail and institutional investors alike. Frontline has a market cap of $1.5 billion and a reputation for generous dividends. Here again, Robinhood users piled in toward the end of April. In this case, the number of owners continued to increase through early July, even as the price of Frontline shares has fallen 28% since late April. There were 11,919 Robinhood owners of Frontline stock on Monday. In general, entries six-10 are the kind of companies owned by larger institutional funds. The difference is that larger funds got into these stocks earlier and pulled back, whereas Robinhood users came in later, kept buying as stocks fell and are still holding. Jon Chappell, analyst at Evercore ISI, previously speculated that just as rates were skyrocketing and retail was getting involved, institutions began fading the rally. #5 — Globus Maritime The Top 5 takes a sharp swerve toward micro-cap retail territory. In a topsy-turvy twist, the penny stocks outrank the industry giants. Dry bulk company Globus Maritime Ltd (NASDAQ:GLBS) takes the fifth slot. On Monday, its stock was trading at 15 cents. Its market cap was around $27 million. A total of 15,863 Robinhood users owned the stock — 2.7 times more users than own stock in shipping giant Euronav. Data from Robintrack shows that Robinhood ownership in Globus spiked beginning June 18 and has kept rising. On June 18, Globus announced the pricing of a registered direct offering (RDO) to a group of institutional investors. New York's Maxim Group was the placement agent. Two more RDOs followed. Last Thursday, the funds buying equity in the RDOs filed to sell shares obtained through warrant exercises. Funds named included Empery, Hudson Bay, Intracoastal, L1 Capital, Sabby, Anson, Alto, Bigger Capital, CVI, Ionic Ventures and Lind Global. The funds disclosed that they had purchased 129.2 million shares and continued to own 54.7 million, meaning they had resold 74.5 million shares between June 18 and last Thursday. The Robintrack chart data reveals where many of those shares ended up — in the accounts of Robinhood users. Between June 17 and Monday, the price of Globus shares has fallen by a third. #4 — Castor Maritime Like Globus, Castor Maritime Inc (NASDAQ:CTRM) is a small, Greek-owned dry bulk owner. It also has a tiny market cap — $26 million — and an unusually big footprint on Robinhood: 16,941 users owned the stock as of Monday. Like Globus, Robinhood users' ownership of Castor spiked on a single day, in this case, June 24. After market close on June 23, Castor announced pricing of an RDO, with Maxim Group as placement manager. Castor did a second RDO this month. Securities filings show that funds owning Castor shares include Empery, L1, CVI and Intracoastal. #3 — Nordic American Tankers Nordic American Tankers has always been highly popular with retail investors, less so with institutional buyers. Its shares have outperformed other tanker stocks. Its trading volume surged in late April to levels far beyond those of any other listed shipping company, following its CEO's appearance on Mad Money. NAT is the only company in the Robinhood shipping Top 5 that is listed on NYSE and has a market cap in the nine figures: $642 million. Its shares were owned by 34,391 Robinhood users on Monday. The Robintrack data shows ownership surging in late April, as was the case with the larger-cap tanker equities. However, the number of users owning NAT is now down 29% from 48,687 on May 4. #2 — Seanergy Seanergy Maritime Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ:SHIP) is yet another Greek-owned dry bulk company with a very small market cap: $26 million. Robintrack data shows a steady rise of Robinhood user ownership starting March 31, building through April, then spiking in the first half of May, before peaking at 95,146 users on May 28, just prior to the company's reverse split. Since the reverse split, the number of users has fallen sharply, to 53,771 as of Monday. On March 31, Seanergy priced the first in a series of common stock and warrants offerings handled by Maxim. It did four more sales through May, coinciding with the period in which Robinhood user ownership of the stock escalated. On May 8, after the completion of the offerings, the funds that bought the shares from Seanergy filed to resell shares they would obtain from exercising warrants. The selling funds were Empery, Hudson Bay, Intracoastal, L1 and Sabby. These funds disclosed that they acquired 187.1 million shares in the offerings and continued to own 39.3 million shares, meaning they had resold 147.8 million shares in a short period of time — the same period when Seanergy catapulted to second place on the Robinhood list. #1 — Top Ships And the winner is … product-tanker owner TOP SHIPS Inc (NASDAQ:TOPS). The tanker owner has raised more money this year from equity sales than any other listed shipping company. It grossed $5 million in an at-the-market offering handled by Maxim in February. Then, on March 31, it launched a series of RDOs with Maxim as placement agent. It did a total of 11 RDOs through this month, raising further gross proceeds of $119.7 million. There are no securities filings yet that confirm who initially bought the RDO shares. However, there were some familiar names in securities filing in November, which listed ownership stakes at that time held by Anson, CVI, Hudson Bay, Intercoastal, KBB and Sabby. The Robintrack data shows that Top Ships' stock was not popular with Robinhood users until the very end of March — exactly when the RDO series began.

2021-02-17,Shipping Stocks Are Suddenly Revving Up Across The Board,"Tanker spot rates are horrible. Rates for gas carriers have fallen off a cliff. Only container shipping is booming. But you wouldn't know that by looking at ocean shipping stocks. Across every shipping sector, stocks are up double digits in February. Shipping stocks have been on a tear for the past several weeks, said Clarksons Platou Securities analyst Omar Nokta during a Capital Link-sponsored virtual event on Tuesday. We've gotten used to seeing pockets [of activity] for tankers or pockets for dry bulk. But we haven't seen this type of interest across the board in a while, said Nokta. Since the beginning of this month, dry bulk stocks of Safe Bulkers (NYSE:SB), Eagle Bulk (NASDAQ:EGLE), Golden Ocean (NASDAQ:GOGL) and Star Bulk (NYSE:SBLK) are up 61%, 48%, 36% and 35%, respectively. Shares of tanker companies Teekay Tankers (NYSE:TNK), Scorpio Tankers (NYSE:STNG) and Euronav (NYSE:EURN) are up 39%, 31% and 20%, respectively. Other tanker and bulker names are also up big. (Chart: Koyfin) In the container liner and leasing sectors, shares of ZIM (NYSE:ZIM), Danaos (NYSE: DAC), Global Ship Lease (NYSE:GSL), Matson (NYSE:MATX) and Costamare (NYSE:CMRE) are up 52%, 40%, 21%, 19% and 17% this month, respectively. (Chart: Koyfin) The ‘retail horde' theory Why has the broader shipping-stock space revved up in February when rates for most non-container segments have not? One theory — particularly in the wake of the GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock spike in late January — is that the retail horde has alighted on shipping stocks. It happened before, in April 2020, when traders on retail platform Robinhood ran up the stock of Nordic American Tankers (NYSE:NAT). If it's happening again, this month's price gains could be fleeting. Evidence for this theory: Micro-cap shipping stocks favored by day traders are performing exceptionally well. Robinhood restricted trading in various stocks amid the GameStop frenzy. One of them was Castor Maritime (NASDAQ:CTRM). Castor's shares have doubled this month. Top Ships (NASDAQ:TOPS) was ranked the 27th-most-traded stock on the Robinhood platform in July 2020 — more popular than Starbucks, Pfizer and ExxonMobil. Top Ships' shares are up 77% this month. The ‘demand is back' theory Theory 2 is that shipping stocks are rising as investors place bets now in preparation for a global economic recovery in the second half and in 2022. According to this thesis, there is a real demand story behind these stock moves. Yes, there are Robinhooders and Redditors about. Retail may be leading the charge. But hedge funds are also getting into the fray, and larger institutional investors are on the sidelines, ready to enter. Clarksons' Omar Nokta (Photo: John Galayda/Marine Money) Nokta argued for Theory 2. Over the past several years, the theme has been that the orderbook is low and there's shrinking supply — and that's always positive. But what was really missing was the demand side of the equation. What's exciting now is that there is a resurgence of demand. It's like the shipping gods asked shipowners: ‘Hey, what would you guys want?' And shipowners said: ‘We'll keep the orderbook low but we'd like to restart the whole demand story.' And now, we're seeing it playing out in the shipping markets, maintained Nokta. He pointed to strong rates in smaller Handysize bulkers carrying minor bulk cargoes — which are correlated to GDP growth — as well as the container-shipping boom and higher energy prices. Betting on recovery Jefferies shipping analyst Randy Giveans said during the Capital Link event, Obviously, 2020 was pretty much ‘risk-off,' especially for shipping. The world was ending. No one wanted economically sensitive, energy-related, global-trade-driven stocks. That is shipping to a T. Now, you're starting to see a little bit of an economic recovery. People are starting to look to the back half of 2021 and to 2022. And in shipping, you can see a lot of upside [to stocks] without extensive inflows because the market caps are all relatively small. Jefferies' Randy Giveans (Photo: John Galayda/Marine Money) Shipping has always been a higher ‘beta' sector, he continued. (Beta is a measure of stock moves in relation to the overall market.) Giveans noted that the 31 shipping stocks covered by Jefferies are up by an average of 34% year-to-date. In contrast, the S&P 500 is up 5% year-to-date, the Russell 2000 15%. Jon Chappell, transportation analyst at Evercore ISI, pointed to nonshipping drivers behind the recent jump in shipping stocks. When you look at the broader market — the reflation trade, commodity strength, small caps, energy, highly shorted stocks, out-of-favor names, a play on the recovery — shipping checks a lot of those boxes, whether in the second half of this year or in 2020. Getting institutional investors back on board Chappell believes recent stock moves certainly seem to be more retail-driven than institutional investor-driven. He said that a true recovery in interest among larger institutional investors will require proof of a sustainable recovery — which remains hypothetical, particularly for tankers. The tanker market is the worst I've ever seen, said Chappell. Evercore ISI's Jon Chappell (Photo: John Galayda/Marine Money) Cyclical spikes in shipping tend to be more short-lived. No investor wants to be left holding the bag when you hit an inflection point. In 2004-08, the shipping industry got the benefit of the doubt whenever there was a downturn. People were always anticipating the next resurgence. But since the global financial crisis, this has been an industry where you have to prove the sustainability of the cycle. We may have a strong fundamental outlook now, but I think it's going to be a slow grind in proving that this can be a sustainable upturn as opposed to just another winter spike or another floating-storage spike or another sanctions-driven spike, said Chappell. Is it really different this time? When you have a multiyear upturn in the market, then you will get broader investor appeal and you will start to see a revaluation of these stocks. And I would argue that we have not had a sustainable cycle [recovery] in any segment of shipping since before the financial crisis. Nokta: This time it's different According to Nokta, It seems like for tankers, it has always been something very exciting but very short-term-oriented. Spot rates spike and the day traders come in and trade the names. We saw record volume last April in this sector but it was just volume. We didn't get people parking in these names. They just traded them back and forth. But to us, it feels quite different this time, he affirmed. Giveans noted that recent years' investor interest was always sector-specific. It was tankers last April and containers in September and dry bulk in June. Now, in terms of investor appetite and interest, it's picking up across the board. Nokta said, I've gotten much busier on the phone, not only talking to hedge funds, which is typically the primary investor base in shipping, but also with more long-only funds. It's not flying off the rails, but there are more discussions. There is more interest. People are sharpening their pencils. There is definitely a much bigger audience waiting in the wings.

2021-03-12,8 Reopening Stocks Under $5,"Analysts and economists are expecting the U.S. economy to significantly accelerate in coming quarters as the coronavirus vaccine rollout facilitates the reopening of many businesses and the unlocking of pent-up demand in hard-hit segments of the economy, including restaurants, travel and retail. With the next round of $1,400 stimulus payments set to go out starting this weekend, some of the most popular stocks among younger retail traders could get a major boost ahead of the economic reopening. Even after the market’s big run off its March 2000 lows, there are still some cheap stocks trading under $5 that could be in for a big run in the next several months. Here are eight stocks under $5 that traders should watch in the near-term. Sundial Growers Inc (NASDAQ:SNDL) Cannabis stocks have been on quite a ride since the beginning of November. Young investors are extremely bullish on cannabis in general, particularly Sundial Growers. Once the economy is back on its feet Democrats in Washington could turn their attention to federal cannabis reform, which could boost stocks like Sundial, which currency trades at under $1.50. OrganiGram Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:OGI) Shares of Canadian cannabis company OrganiGram have skyrocketed this week following a large investment from tobacco giant British American Tobacco PLC (NYSE:BTI). OrganiGram still trades under $5, but it might not for much longer.

The Baltic Exchange Dry Index (BDI) has been trending higher in 2021, yet Castor shares trade at only around $1 per share. See Also: Beginning Investor?

(NYSE:CHS) Chico's FAS is a specialty retailer of private label women’s apparel, accessories and other products and is the owner of the Chico’s, White House Black Market, and Soma. A resurgence of the apparel retail sector could send Chico’s stock soaring well above its current $3.50 share price. Tuniu Corp (NASDAQ:TOUR) Tuniu is a Chinese online leisure travel company. Analysts expect leisure travel to return faster than business travel, and China contained the pandemic much earlier than many other parts of the world. Tuniu currently trades at just $3.80, but could have meaningful upside one pent-up travel demand is released. Nokia Oyj (NYSE:NOK) Nokia is both a play on 5G wireless networks and a bet on the WallStreetBets trade. One the stimulus checks go out, the same retail traders that have been buying GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) could also be buying Nokia. Zomedica Corp (NYSE:ZOM) Pet health company Zomedica is launching its first product, which could be a major catalyst for the stock. Zomedica is definitely a high-risk/high-reward reopening play at this point priced at under $2.30 per share."

2021-04-25,This Penny Stock Is Creeping Up To A Key Technical Level,"Naked Brand Group LTD. (NASDAQ:NAKD) moved higher Friday, likely after shareholders voted for approval of the proposed transaction to divest its Bendon brand brick-and-mortar operations. Another recent development from the company includes an appointment of a new chief financial officer, Mark Ziirsen, as of April 19, 2021. Naked Brand Daily Chart Analysis Naked Brand stock looks to be testing a key level where it has previously held as resistance. The stock has been forming higher lows throughout the past six months. The stock is trading below the 50-day moving average (green) and above the 200-day moving average (blue), indicating the stock is most likely facing a period of consolidation. The 50-day moving average may hold as a place of resistance on the chart, and the 200-day moving average is a potential area of support. Key Levels To Watch In May 2020, the stock held the $0.60 level as support. Later in the year the stock broke down below this level and tested its resistance a handful of times. Late January 2021 saw a breakout above this level before the stock eventually fell back below. The stock is now looking to test this level again, and consolidation above the level could let this stock see higher moves. The stock began trading with higher lows in November 2020, and can be seen in the trendline on the chart above. What’s Next? Bullish technical traders would like to see the stock break above the resistance line and consolidate. Consolidation above the $0.60 level could let the stock see a breakout. Bearish technical traders would like to see the stock fall below the $0.60 level. If the stock is able to break below the trendline, it could see a further downwards push. Naked Brand had over 50 million shares traded Friday, and notably, a large amount of activity. Some other penny stocks that traded at that volume on Friday include: Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL), Sypris Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:SYPR), Castor Maritime Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRM) and Jaguar Health Inc. (NASDAQ:JAGX). Image by makingmilly from Pixabay."

2021-05-03,"Precipio Surges 140%, Breaks Out Of A Falling Wedge Pattern","Precipio Inc. (NASDAQ:PRPO) shares surged 140% Monday after the company successfully launched its COVID-19 rapid antibody test that tests for both IgG & IgM antibodies. Testing for antibodies will let people know if they have previously been exposed to the virus or have been vaccinated. Precipio holds the exclusive right to distribute the product on Amazon Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) platform. Precipio Daily Chart Analysis Precipio looks to have broken out of what technical traders may call a falling wedge pattern. The stock crossed above both the 50-day moving average (green) as well as the 200-day moving average (blue) Monday. This indicates the sentiment of the stock is most likely turning bullish. The moving averages are areas on the chart that may hold a support level unless the price makes a strong move downwards through them. Key Levels To Watch The stock has been falling the past couple of months forming into a falling wedge pattern before breaking out Monday. This pattern is considered a bullish reversal pattern as connecting the highs shows a much steeper drop compared to connecting the lows of the chart, forming a wedge. Precipio shares were able to cross above the lines connecting the highs. The shares jumped further following the breakout. What’s Next? Bullish technical traders would like to see the stock consolidate for a period of time while holding some of the gains from the jump Monday. The stock may now show resistance near the $4.25 level as this was the high at the top of the falling wedge pattern. A bullish trader would like to see the price cross above this level for a possible further move up. Bearish technical traders would like to see the stock fall back to the levels it was at while it was trading within the falling wedge pattern. If the price is able to fall below these levels, it could be prone to a steep drop. Precipio had over 50 million shares traded, and considerably, a large amount of activity. Some other penny stocks trading with over 50 million volume Friday include Sundial Growers Inc. (NASDAQ:SNDL), Farmmi Inc. (NASDAQ:FAMI) and Castor Maritime Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRM)"
2021-05-13,"If You Invested $1,000 In Castor Maritime Stock One Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now","Investors who have owned stocks in the past year have generally experienced some big gains. But there is no question some big-name stocks performed better than others along the way. Castor’s Wild Run: One company that has been a rollercoaster investment in the past year has been dry bulk shipper Castor Maritime Inc (NASDAQ:CTRM). Dry bulk shipping stocks have been brutal investments over the past decade, and Castor Maritime is no exception. Since the stock first listed on the Nasdaq in February 2019, shares are down 91.6% overall in just over two years. In the past year alone, Castor’s share count has also exploded by more than 9,000%, including the sale of 192.3 million shares in April. The company has acquired 11 vessels so far in 2021 to build up its fleet, but investors are paying a heavy price for those acquisitions. In 2019, Castor generated a $1 million net profit on $5.9 million in revenue. In 2020, revenue more than doubled to $12.4 million, but the company swung to a net loss of $1.7 million. At the beginning of 2020, Castor shares were trading at $1.86. By the beginning of March, the stock was down to 85 cents as news of the coronavirus spreading in China prompted concerns about a U.S. pandemic. On March 23, Castor shares dropped all the way down to 48 cents in intraday trading. While the overall market bottomed around that time, Castor shares still had a long way to fall. The stock recovered to as high as $1.08 in late March amid a broad market rally, but the bottom fell out at that point. In September, Castor reported an updated count of 131,212,376 shares outstanding, up from just 9,859,042 shares outstanding in the previous quarter. Castor hit its all-time low of 11 cents per share shortly thereafter. Related Link: If You Invested $1,000 In Alibaba Stock One Year Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Now Castor In 2021, Beyond: Fortunately for Castor investors the stock was thrown a surprising life preserver in January 2021. With Castor still trading under 20 cents per share, Reddit’s WallStreetBets community orchestrated a coordinated buying campaign in the stock as part of a targeted short squeeze effort. The short squeeze sent the stock skyrocketing to as high as $1.95 in early February. Since the dust has settled on the short squeeze, Castor shares are now back down to around 42 cents. Castor investors who cashed out during the height of the squeeze were completely bailed out of the catastrophic losses they would have otherwise endured during the 2020 collapse in the stock. Unfortunately, Castor investors who held on for the long-term based on optimism that rising Baltic Dry Index prices would offset the company’s aggressive dilution are now back underwater. In fact, $1,000 in Castor stock bought on May 11, 2020 would be worth about $594 today. Looking ahead, Castor will need to show investors that its fleet expansion will help the company put up top- and bottom-line growth numbers that justify the massive dilution the company has subjected them to in the past year. Investors should also anticipate a reverse stock split at some point so the stock can maintain its Nasdaq listing, a phenomenon that is all too familiar for dry bulk shipping investors over the past 10 years."

2021-07-06,Castor Maritime Stock: Technical Levels To Watch,"Despite its reverse split on May 28, the death spiral of Castor Maritime Inc. (NASDAQ:CTRM) continues. This chart teaches an important lesson about the markets. When stocks head lower, levels that had been support can convert into resistance. This happens because many of the investors who bought shares while the stock was at support regret their decision to do so after the support breaks and the stock heads lower. Many of them decide to sell, but they will only do so if they can sell the shares at the same price they paid for them. Then they can get out without losing money. As a result, they place their sell orders at levels that were previously support. If there are enough of these orders, resistance forms. This is a common occurrence in markets.

2021-08-05,So What's Up With Castor Maritime's Stock Thursday?,"Castor Maritime Inc (NASDAQ:CTRM) shares are trading higher by 15% at $2.33 Thursday morning after the company reported second-quarter EPS of 7 cents per share, up from a loss of 12 cents per share year-over-year. Castor Maritime also reported second-quarter sales of $21.80 million, up from $2.59 million year-over-year. Petros Panagiotidis, Chief Executive Officer of Castor commented:The first six months of 2021 was a transformational period for our Company, as we were able to raise $262.5 million of equity and $33.3 million of debt and grow our fleet from 6 vessels at the end of 2020 to 26 vessels on a fully delivered basis. Strong demand for dry bulk transportation services has resulted in robust freight rates, with the upward momentum expected to be sustained by the tight vessel supply and historically low newbuilding orderbook. Following our timely acquisitions, Castor is well-positioned to take advantage of this strong market with a dry bulk fleet consisting of 18 vessels, on a fully delivered basis. At the same time, most of our newly acquired tanker vessels are in either term or pool employment ensuring a high utilization for that part of our fleet. Castor Maritime is a provider of seaborne transportation services for dry bulk cargo, including iron ore, coal, grain, steel products, fertilizers, cement, bauxite, sugar, scrap metal, among others. The company's revenues are derived from time charter, bareboat charter and spot charter contracts. Castor Maritime has a 52-week high of $19.50 and a 52-week low of $1.12."

2022-01-12,5 Value Stocks In The Industrials Sector,"What is a Value Stock? A value stock traditionally has a lower price when compared to stock prices of companies in the same industry. This indicates that the company may be undervalued, as investors are not expressing as much interest in such companies. The most commonly used way to check for value is with the price-to-earnings multiple, or P/E. A low P/E multiple is a good indication that the stock is undervalued. The following stocks are considered to be notable value stocks in the industrials sector: Louisiana-Pacific (NYSE:LPX) - P/E: 5.29 Covenant Logistics Group (NASDAQ:CVLG) - P/E: 8.18 Atkore (NYSE:ATKR) - P/E: 8.69 Castor Maritime (NASDAQ:CTRM) - P/E: 7.26 Cornerstone Building (NYSE:CNR) - P/E: 3.36 Louisiana-Pacific has reported Q3 earnings per share at 3.87, which has decreased by 18.35% compared to Q2, which was 4.74. Most recently, the company reported a dividend yield of 1.19%, which has decreased by 0.09% from last quarter's yield of 1.28%. Covenant Logistics Group saw an increase in earnings per share from 0.96 in Q2 to 1.02 now. Atkore's earnings per share for Q4 sits at 4.39, whereas in Q3, they were at 3.96. Castor Maritime has reported Q3 earnings per share at 0.16, which has increased by 128.57% compared to Q2, which was 0.07. Cornerstone Building saw a decrease in earnings per share from 0.67 in Q2 to 0.39 now. The Significance: A value stock may need some time to rebound from its undervalued position. The risk of investing in a value stock is that this emergence may never materialize."

2022-07-26,How Much Money Do Shipping CEOs Make? Here's Their 2021 Pay Info,"Managing ships is big business. It should come as no surprise that bosses of ship-operating companies are highly compensated. What may surprise you is that the CEOs with the largest fleets don't necessarily earn the highest compensation. The biggest winners last year were almost certainly heads of private shipowning companies that sold or leased container ships for eye-watering sums and stashed windfalls in offshore accounts. Outside of the families themselves and their lawyers and accountants, no one will know how much they made. For CEOs employed as managers of public companies, compensation is sometimes (but not always) disclosed. Now that all the annual reports are in, annual general meetings have been held and remuneration reports have been filed, these numbers are publicly available. Container shipping CEOs Maersk: The world's second-largest container-line operator, Denmark-listed A.P. Moller-Maersk, is unusual among commercial shipping entities. Its business model — end-to-end logistics with a focus on long-term relationships — is much less commoditized than, for example, a spot-trading tanker owner whose profits hinge almost entirely on volatile oil flows. Management decisions at a company like Maersk matter, a lot. A.P. Moller-Maersk CEO Soren Skou (Photo: AP Photo/Ludovic Marin) Soren Skou, CEO of A.P. Moller-Maersk, received total 2021 compensation of 46.8 million Danish kroners ($7.16 million based on end-of-year exchange rates), up from $7.08 million in 2020 and $5.71 million in 2019. Of Skou's 2021 compensation, 25% was in stock and options. Maersk's net profit spiked by $15.2 billion in 2021 versus 2020, or by 514%. Skou's compensation, measured in kroners, increased 8.6%. Hapag-Lloyd: Rolf Habben Jansen is the CEO of Germany-listed Hapag-Lloyd, the world's fifth-largest liner operator. In 2021, Habben Jansen earned total compensation of 2.9 million euros ($3 million). That's up from $2.97 million in 2020 and $2.51 million in 2019. Habben Jansen's compensation is all cash, no shares, due to the low volume of Hapag-Lloyd shares in free float, said the company. Hapag-Lloyd's net profits jumped by $9.7 billion last year versus 2020, or by 907%. Habben Jansen's compensation, measured in euros, rose 14%. Matson: Compensation for CEOs of U.S.-listed container-line operators is considerably higher than for European-listed companies when adjusted for fleet size, albeit more focused on stock awards. Hawaii-based Matson (NYSE:MATX) is the world's 27th-largest liner operator, according to Alphaliner data. Maersk's fleet is 62 times the size of Matson's. Hapag-Lloyd's is 26 times larger. Even so, Matson CEO Matthew Cox earned total compensation of $5.96 million last year, well above Habben Jansen's and only $1.2 million below Skou's. Matson's net income increased by $734.3 million in 2021 versus 2020, or 380%. Cox's remuneration rose by 9% (with 53% of his total in stock). Zim: Eli Glickman, CEO of Zim (NYSE:ZIM), was the biggest compensation winner among publicly listed liner operators. According to Alphaliner data, Zim has the world's 10th-largest liner fleet, with less than an eighth the capacity of Maersk and less than a third the capacity of Hapag-Lloyd. Yet Glickman earned total compensation of $9.92 million last year, up sharply from $2.79 million in 2020. That's triple what Habben Jansen earned and almost $3 million more than Skou. Zim's net income was $4.1 billion higher in 2021 than in 2020, equating to an increase of 787%. Glickman's compensation rose by 255% (with 74% of Glickman's reported 2021 compensation in stock, not cash). Note: Zim CEO compensation not disclosed for 2019 (Chart: American Shipper based on company filings) Bulk commodity shipping CEOs Among the U.S-listed shipowners and operators in the dry and liquid bulk trades, the highest paid CEO last year was David Grzebinski, CEO of Kirby (NYSE:KEX). Kirby is America's largest operator of inland tank barges. Grzebinski earned total compensation of $5.83 million in 2021, up 36% from 2020, with stock representing 57% of the total. His company recorded a net loss of $247 million in 2021, compared to a net loss of $272.5 million in 2020. Eagle Bulk CEO Gary Vogel (Photo: John Galayda/Marine Money) Gary Vogel, CEO of Eagle Bulk (NASDAQ:EGLE), received compensation of $3.94 million (54% in stock), up 135% year on year. Eagle Bulk reported net income of $184.9 million in 2021 versus a net loss of $35.1 million in 2020. Lois Zabrocky, CEO of crude and product tanker owner International Seaways (NYSE:INSW), earned $3.04 million last year, down 10% from 2020. Her company reported a net loss of $133.5 million in 2021, compared to a net loss of $5.5 million in 2020. Many U.S.-listed commodity shipping owners are so-called foreign private issuers and do not have to report individual executive compensation. Rather, they report aggregate compensation for management teams. Most of these disclosures reported total team compensation in the range of $2 million-$3 million for 2021, while others were considerably higher. Scorpio Tankers (NYSE:STNG) reported total management team compensation of $22.9 million. Navios Partners (NYSE:NMM) reported $28.8 million. In addition, several listed shipowners do substantial related-party transactions with private entities owned by the public entity's sponsor. The founder, the CEO of the public entity, can obtain profits via his or her private holdings. Castor Maritime (NASDAQ:CTRM) paid $3.1 million in expenses to related parties last year. Globus Maritime (NASDAQ:GLBS) had administrative fees to related parties of $1.4 million. Top Ships (NASDAQ:TOPS) listed $1.1 million in expenses paid to related parties. Scorpio generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues each year via vessel pools controlled by the family of its founder. Cruise shipping compensation Management compensation in commercial shipping pales in comparison to cruise shipping, where vessels are run for hospitality, not transport. At Carnival Corp. (NYSE:CCL), CEO Arnold David — who's retiring next Monday — received compensation valued at $15.06 million last year (49% in stock). His compensation increased 13% year on year. Carnival reported a net loss of $9.5 billion for fiscal year 2021 (through Nov. 30) compared to a net loss of $10.2 billion the year before. Richard Fain, who retired from his post as CEO of Royal Caribbean (NYSE:RCL) in January, earned $15.81 million last year (71% in stock). That was up 31% versus 2020 because Fain voluntarily declined stock awards that year due to COVID. Royal Caribbean lost $5.3 billion in 2021 and $5.8 billion the year before. NCL CEO Frank Del Rio (Photo: AP Photo/Richard Drew) The poster child of high compensation continues to be Frank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE:NCLH), a company that has half the fleet capacity of Royal Caribbean and a quarter the capacity of Carnival Corp. In 2020, Del Rio's package totaled a headline-grabbing $36.38 million. During the annual general meeting vote that year, 83% opposed the payout, but those votes were nonbinding. For 2021, the head of NCL's compensation committee told shareholders that Del Rio's new package was designed to address the concerns that shareholders expressed the prior year. Del Rio's compensation in 2021: $19.67 million, with 72% in stock. During this May's annual general meeting, there were more than five times as many nonbinding votes opposed to his compensation as there were in favor. To put Del Rio's package in perspective, NCL lost $9.5 billion in 2020-2021 combined. Maersk had net income of $21.1 billion over the same period. NCL's current market cap is now around one-ninth the size of Maersk's. And yet, over the past two years, the NCL CEO's compensation was almost quadruple that of Maersk's CEO.

2023-07-12,A Look Into Industrials Sector Value Stocks,"What is a Value Stock? A value stock traditionally has a lower price when compared to stock prices of companies in the same industry. This indicates that the company may be undervalued, as investors are not expressing as much interest in such companies. The most commonly used way to check for value is with the price-to-earnings multiple, or P/E. A low P/E multiple is a good indication that the stock is undervalued. Benzinga Insights has compiled a list of value stocks in the industrials sector that may be worth watching: Pyxis Tankers (NASDAQ:PXS) - P/E: 1.82 AerCap Holdings (NYSE:AER) - P/E: 9.04 Leonardo DRS (NASDAQ:DRS) - P/E: 9.65 Euroseas (NASDAQ:ESEA) - P/E: 1.49 Castor Maritime (NASDAQ:CTRM) - P/E: 0.47 Pyxis Tankers saw an increase in earnings per share from 0.53 in Q4 to $0.71 now. AerCap Holdings saw a decrease in earnings per share from 2.66 in Q4 to $2.34 now. Leonardo DRS's earnings per share for Q1 sits at $0.07, whereas in Q4, they were at 0.35. Euroseas's earnings per share for Q1 sits at $3.09, whereas in Q4, they were at 2.5. The company's most recent dividend yield sits at 10.66%, which has increased by 0.2% from 10.46% last quarter. Castor Maritime's earnings per share for Q1 sits at $-0.07, whereas in Q4, they were at 0.36. The Significance: A value stock may need some time to rebound from its undervalued position. The risk of investing in a value stock is that this emergence may never materialize."
