Sentiment:Analyzing SPDR Gold Trust's Unusual Options Activity On Thursday, shares of SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) saw unusual options activity. After the option alert, the stock price moved down to $170.4. Sentiment: BULLISH Option Type: SWEEP Trade Type: CALL Expiration Date: 2021-08-20 Strike Price: $175.00 Volume: 1922 Open Interest: 16472 Three Ways Options Activity Is ‘Unusual' Extraordinarily large volume (compared to historical averages) is one indication of unusual options market activity. Volume refers to the total number of contracts traded over a given time period when discussing options market activity. Open interest is the number of unsettled contracts that have been traded but not yet closed by either counterparty. In other words, open interest represents the quantity of contracts that individual parties have written but not yet found a counterparty for (i.e. a buyer finding a seller, or a seller finding a buyer). Another sign of unusual activity is the trading of a contract with an expiration date in the distant future. Usually, additional time until a contract expires allows more opportunity for it to reach its strike price and grow its time value. Time value is important to consider because it represents the difference between the strike price and the value of the underlying asset. Contracts that are out of the money are also indicative of unusual options activity. Out of the money contracts occur when the underlying price is under the strike price on a call option, or above the strike price on a put option. These trades are made with the expectation that the value of the underlying asset is going to change dramatically in the future, and buyers and sellers will benefit from a greater profit margin. Understanding Sentiment Options are bullish when a call is purchased at/near ask price or a put is sold at/near bid price. Options are bearish when a call is sold at/near bid price or a put is bought at/near ask price. These observations are made without knowing the investor's true intent by purchasing these options contracts. The activity is suggestive of these strategies, but an observer cannot be sure if a bettor is playing the contract outright or if the options bettor is hedging a large underlying position in common stock. For the latter case, bullish options activity may be less meaningful than the exposure a large investor has on their short position in common stock. Using These Options Strategies Unusual options activity is an advantageous strategy that may greatly reward an investor if they are highly skilled, but for the less experienced trader, it should remain as another tool to make an educated investment decision while taking other observations into account.

2016-02-09,The Coal Conundrum For Transportation ETFs,"The Market Vectors Coal ETF (NYSE: KOL) declined yesterday on heavy volume, but the lone equity-based exchange traded fund dedicated to moribund coal equities did not hit a new low. Still, KOL has lost nearly two-thirds of its value over the past two years and slumping demand for the commodity is hampering other ETFs beyond KOL. For example, as KOL has plunged 56.6 percent over the past year, the iShares Transportation Average ETF (NYSE: IYT) has tumbled more than 23 percent over that period. Figuring out the iShares Transportation Average ETF's coal conundrum is not difficult. IYT, which tracks the widely followed Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, devotes 21.5 percent of its weight to railroad stocks, making that group the ETF's second-largest industry allocation. U.S. railroad operators have experienced declining shipping volumes and share prices due in part to what has become a lengthy bear market for coal. “The Association of American Railroads (AAR) reported that total US rail carload traffic in 2015 declined by 2.5% from 2014 levels. 2015's overall rail traffic was below levels not seen since the rail traffic recovery began in 2009. AAR reported that 2016 is off to a mixed start as well. Overall carload traffic in January was 16.6% lower than January 2015. However, a closer look at the long-term annual data indicates that the majority of the declines are due to lower coal shipping. If coal is excluded from 2015 data, rail volume is comparable to levels seen in 2013 and 2014, on the strength of intermodal container traffic,” said Fitch Ratings in a recent note. Three of IYT's top 10 holdings – Kansas City Southern (NYSE: KSU), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NYSE: NSC) – are railroad operators. The coal industry has been drubbed in recent years. Many U.S. utilities have moved away from coal as natural gas prices have plummeted because natural gas burns cleaner than coal. Slack demand has forced past and current KOL constituents into bankruptcy with market observers forecasting more to come. Several of KOL's 26 holdings sport sub-$4 price tags. If there is a bright spot, it is that the rapid decline of the U.S. coal industry is not expected to hamper IYT's other industry exposures. “Recent declines in rail traffic are unlikely to spread to other modes of transportation as the declines are primarily attributable to coal shipping, which mainly relies on rail transportation, Fitch Ratings says. However, rail traffic declines will persist into the midterm,” said Fitch. Coal usage is expected to decline four percent this year and one percent in 2017, adds the research firm."

2011-08-04,A Double Dip? How Do We Protect Ourselves?,"Today I am going to do something really amazing. I am going to tell you that in my opinion the U.S. economy has not entered a second recession, it never came out of the first one. Well, before you professional economists start writing me that the Webster's definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth I will simply say for who? Indeed there are many Americans who have been so economically ravaged by this crisis that they have not lived through a recession - they have endured a depression. A Gallup poll that was released in April (when the DOW was 800 points higher than today's close) said that 29% of the people polled didn't care what the definition of a recession was. They said they were in a depression. Add to that, another 26% polled said that they felt they had never come out of the original recession. Please ask yourself if it is any wonder that most Americans believe that an economic downturn is still in progress? One only has to look around to see all the evidence they need to draw that conclusion. Home prices are at levels we have not seen since 2002 and add to that in many parts of the country like Florida, California, Nevada and Arizona values of homes have dropped a staggering 50 percent. According to the National Association of Realtors home prices will likely drop another ten 10 % nationwide. They also reported a staggering statistic. If you had bought a home under the program set forth by President Obama that gave you $8500.00 towards the purchase of a home, and if you had put down an additional 20% towards the purchase of the home you would now be underwater on your mortgage. It is painfully evident to most average Americans that there are signs that a full blown recession is firmly in place. I guess it is harder for the myriad of professional economists hired by the Fed to see the forest for the trees. In my opinion there is nothing that damages the confidence of a consumer as badly as rapidly rising prices. When I am not writing my posts I have the dubious distinction of doing the heavy grocery shopping for my family. I have been amazed and appalled at the spike in the price of groceries. A pound of coffee that used to cost $2.99 now costs $6.00. Milk is almost $5.00 a gallon. My children are grown and my wife and I don't drink milk but as I walk by the dairy aisle I keep an eye on the price of milk because I often wonder how parents with children can afford to buy milk. Clothing has gone through the roof as cotton prices nearly doubled in 2010. The consumer's ability to buy the most basic clothing necessities has been undermined. While the auto industry has staged an impressive comeback, much of its profitability has been based on layoffs as much as new car sales. Slower car sales are not only a sign of lagging consumer confidence but also a sign of tougher times ahead. Car firms have only just begun to hire again but that trend will die as the sales of cars plateau. The circus that took place over raising the debt ceiling is going to make it very difficult for Dr. Bernanke to institute another round of quantitative easing. He will have to be more ‘stealthy' is his approach because while the FOMC remains tight lipped many prominent economists like Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman say another round of quantitative easing is essential to create a full recovery. His theory has seemingly been borne out by last week's GDP numbers which had a revised estimate of 0.04% for the first quarter and a 1.4% estimate for the second quarter. For a robust economy I have read that economists see the need for a minimum of 5% GDP. The debt ceiling agreement has caused a call to arms for severe austerity measures which is exactly what our already fragile economy does not need. The fact is that people are afraid and they have tightened their belts and are saving every penny they can. While a healthy savings plan is the watchword of a healthy society I'm sure the Feds wished that the American people practice this kind of economic restraint on somebody else's watch. What the Feds need are the American people spending to stimulate the economy. It certainly is a Catch -22 situation. Add to this that today's employment numbers promise to be anemic as Cisco has said they would lay off 6000 people, HSBC has promised to lay off 2000 people and state and local governments have said it is their intention to trim the payrolls by 450,000 jobs this year and next. These government cuts are already well underway. One can barely open a local newspaper without reading of battles between state unions and governors over employment, benefits and pensions. A slowdown in the Chinese economy is usually seen as a cause of global commodity price inflation, but this coin has two sides. While China's appetite for energy and raw materials may fall, the demand for goods and services by its very large and growing middle class drop along with it. As China has raised the interest rate in an effort to slow down the exploding growth rate the U.S. exports to China have also fallen. According to the U.S. – China Business Council, over the last decade we have seen exports to China grow from $16.2 Billion to $91.9 billion a staggering 468% increase. However, as that rate slows it has a profound impact on tens of thousands of American companies and their employees. U.S. firms with large operations in China are also affected. GM is one of the two largest car firms in China along with VW. Large U.S. corporations like Wal-Mart and Yum Brands rely heavily on China to boost global sales. Without vibrant consumer spending in China, American companies suffer. Unemployment creates two problems. People without jobs drastically curtail their spending, which ultimately affects GDP growth and secondly is the need for tens of billions of dollars every year in government aid to keep the unemployed from becoming destitute. That support has increased deficits and the domino effect is that cash – strapped governments need to make more spending cuts. The continued high rate of unemployment may well be the biggest challenge the economy faces. Unemployment has worsened because people over 65 continue to work because their homes, which were once thought of as the financial base of their retirements have dropped so sharply. Older Americans also fear that cuts in Medicare and Social Security are inevitable which will increase the cost of their “golden years”. The worst part of the unemployment problem is the roughly 5 million Americans that have been unemployed for over a year. Their unemployment benefits, in many cases, may have run out. The burden of their care falls to their families, friends and community organizations. To the extent that the federal or state governments can support the unemployed, the cost to run support programs increases. Housing is considered by many economists to be the single largest drag on the American economy and the housing market has gotten much worse in the last three months. Whether right or wrong, the American home was the rock that families built their economic future on. It was the primary source of equity that was used for college educations, car purchases and ultimately retirements. While this may once have been true the drop in home prices wiped out the equity that many people saw as their life savings overnight. Their ability to consume was severely damaged, further harming the GDP. High mortgage payments bankrupted people who had lost their jobs or have found that their incomes had stagnated. The building Industry became a shambles overnight. Whatever the effects have been over the last three years, they are getting progressively worse as home values drop to unprecedented lows. Sadly, there is no relief in sight because potential buyers perceive that the price erosion of a home has not come close to ending. So in conclusion, while I reread this essay, it certainly paints a very bleak picture. You may rightly ask where the harbor is. In which direction do I set my compass? The answer is the same as it has always been – follow the money. China, India and Brazil all continue to amass large amounts of physical gold and silver. Several days ago it was reported that South Korea had bought $1 billion dollars worth of gold. Even the people of Greece who are bankrupt are taking what little paper money they have and buying gold and silver. I would advise my readers to continue to look for opportunities to open positions in gold and silver. While I have been amazed by the parabolic run in gold and there are a lot of people that say gold which was had a target price of $1,600.00 an ounce has blown through that level and seems to have no intention of correcting. Indeed, I read several analysts report that we may see gold reaching $2,500.00 an ounce before it pauses. While my Instincts tell me that the probability for this is remote my brain tells me to follow the money. As global currencies are debased and global fears continue to grow it seems that this shiny yellow metal will continue to rise. Let us not forget its baby bother silver which has broken the $40.04 resistance level and seems on its way to my predicted level of $55.00 - $60.00 by year's end. I had a reader chide me yesterday that my $55.00 level was ridiculous. Silver would be $100.00 an ounce by the year's end. So look for the Silver ETF (SLV) to pull back to $38.00. If it does pullback to $38.00 buy in there. I'm not sure how to advise you on the gold ETF (GLD). As I have already written the levels that GLD are trading seem over bought but I see no red lights in front of it. I would advise that you stand aside until there is more certainty. I am fond of quoting Doug Kass who likes to say “I would rather lose an opportunity than lose capital.” In the mean time don't forget about the miners. There are still great opportunities in these stocks as gold and silver under the ground have continued to lag gold and silver above the ground. Some names that continue to stand out are Silver Wheaton (SLW), Barrick (ABX), Goldcorp (GG) and for a longer term investment US Gold (UXG) have significant upside potential."

2014-04-23,Homebuilding Stocks: Has Spring Sprung? - Zacks Analyst Interviews,"The housing slowdown that began in the second half of 2013 was aggravated by a harsh winter. This took a toll on the homebuilders in the December quarter, delaying construction and raising serious doubts as to the strength of the housing market. The weather has no doubt been a major spoilsport for the sector in the past quarter. However, there are other pressing issues for the builders as well. Shortage of lots and skilled labor, rising cost of materials and a declining level of new homes in inventory are not making things easier for these builders. Moreover, the recent spike in mortgage rates and rising home prices are hurting demand. As a result, many companies saw declining order trends in the last reported quarter. Orders declined around 18% at PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM), 6% at Toll Brothers, Inc. (NYSE: TOL) and 4% at Ryland Group, Inc. (NYSE: RYL) in the last reported quarter. Though order trends improved year over year for others like Lennar Corp. (NYSE: LEN), it slowed down from the past quarter. A slew of data released recently clearly shows that the housing sector has had it tough in the recent past. Homebuilder confidence, as indicated by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo housing market index, dropped to 47 in both April and March and 46 in February from 56 in January indicating increasing builder concerns about meeting ongoing and future demand thanks to a shortage of lots and labor. Further, housing starts declined 0.2% to an annualized rate of 907,000 in February from the prior month, weighed down by lower multi-family starts. Meanwhile, single-family homes and apartments rose only slightly. The February data was a continuation of the January trend when starts dropped 16%. New home sales also dipped 3.3% in February as the weather remained bitter and supply constraints continued to plague homebuilders. However, as the winter chill subsides and builders prepare for the upcoming spring selling season, improving trends may well be in the cards. Builders are increasing their inventories of homes as they anticipate a relatively strong spring buying season. This might propel homebuilder stocks higher in the months ahead as demand for new homes rise. Although interest rates are rising, they are currently doing so below historical levels; housing is still affordable. In addition, accelerating job growth, an improving economy and unlocking pent-up demand will likely boost demand for new homes for the rest of the year. Building permits, a measure of future construction, rose 7.7% in February, the highest rate since October last year and, more importantly, the second highest rate since the middle of 2009. The strong permits show that we can expect steady gains in construction activities over the spring and summer months. NAHB also expects 2014 to be a strong year for housing, expecting a big increase in single-family construction. OPPORTUNITIES Land as Native Strength Homebuilders like Lennar and Toll Brothers with a solid land position have been able to better capitalize on the rising demand for homes during the upturn. This gave these companies a competitive edge over peers like Pulte which faced land availability constraints. During the downturn, Lennar strategically focused on acquiring new home sites in well-positioned markets. The company thus has enough land in all major markets to satisfy deliveries well into 2015. However, others like Pulte have intentionally slowed down the sales pace across some of their communities (thus lowering the community count) due to a lack of land development and scarcity of finished lots. Housing inventory, both existing and new homes, remains tight in most markets. Instead, Pulte has been more focused on driving price and margin in most communities. This strategy hurt net order growth significantly, with orders declining around 10% in fiscal 2013 -- a stark contrast to the increase enjoyed by most of its peers. California-based homebuilder KB Home (NYSE: KBH) is also emphasizing on price and margin improvement to optimize returns from its land assets. This slowed down its sales pace and resulted in lower order growth in 2013. Though the price optimization initiatives of Pulte and KB Home have boosted profits in the past, the companies need to increase their volumes consistently to boost long-term top-line growth. Other homebuilders have realized the importance of land investments. Ryland Group has spent $689 million on land acquisition and $257 million on site development in 2013. Texas-based D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE: DHI) invested $2.6 billion in land, lots and development in 2013, positioning it well to meet demand for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. KB Home spent $1.14 billion in land investment in fiscal 2013, significantly more than $564.9 million spent in 2012. In fact, aggressive land investments helped KB Home record better order trends in its last reported quarter, Q1 of fiscal 2014. High-End Homes Driving Prices Despite the softness in the market, pricing remained strong in the back half of the year. Home prices began moving up sharply from 2013 with market demand gaining momentum and supply remaining limited. Many homebuilders like Lennar, KB Home and Toll Brothers have shifted their focus on high-end communities, primarily in California, Arizona, Colorado and Florida, which allow them to sell larger, higher-priced homes, driving the ASPs up. Homebuilders like KB Home also target the higher income, move-up buyers who are more likely to qualify for home loans. Pulte is shifting its focus towards its high-priced Pulte-branded, move-up homes, which improve the overall ASP. Also, Pulte is building some new commonly-managed communities that represent homes that have been constructed under the company's more efficient design, cost and build processes and thus generate better margins and volumes than the non-commonly-managed communities. Another small homebuilder, Meritage Homes Corporation (NYSE: MTH), is also seeing improving selling prices from a mix shift towards move-up homes in higher priced communities and states. Luxury home-builder Toll Brothers is focused on improving the quality and the luxury quotient of its homes, thus giving it a competitive advantage. Margins Remain Strong Despite slowing volumes in the second half, pricing remained strong, which along with tight cost control and improved efficiencies boosted the overall margins for many homebuilders. Most housing companies are striving to improve their operating and financial performance through strategic restructuring initiatives. The initiatives taken include workforce reductions, improving overhead leverage, managing inventory tightly and implementing new pricing strategies. The homebuilders expect these cost reduction and operating efficiency improvement plans combined with positive housing demand to continue to boost profitability in 2014. Ancillary Companies Seeing Strong Momentum Construction material companies Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE: VMC) and Eagle Materials Inc. (NYSE: EXP), and building product makers Masco Corp. (NYSE: MAS) and Louisiana-Pacific Corp. (NYSE: LPX), have gained momentum from improving new home demand. These companies also saw a concomitant rise in demand and volume for their products. In fact, Vulcan Materials' second-half revenues and profits improved significantly from the first half as improving private construction activity and better weather conditions markedly raised volumes. Positive trends in new home construction activity and improvement in repair/remodel activity in North America significantly improved Masco's top line in the second half of 2013. Fed to Keep Interest Rates Low For most of 2013, the Federal Reserve bought $85 billion in government bonds and mortgage backed securities a month, known as quantitative easing, to keep interest rates low and boost economic growth. However, the Fed scaled back the bond buying program thrice by $10 billion each as economic growth picked up. At present, the Fed is buying $55 billion in bonds per month. Ideally, tapering of the bond-buying plan would have put pressure on interest/mortgage rates. However, the Fed has maintained tight control on interest rates and they have been kept low, irrespective of the reduction in the bond buying program. This has removed a major overhang for homebuilders. WEAKNESSES Supply Constraints A shortage of approved home sites, labor constraints in some markets and a lack of available capital for smaller builders are lowering the supply of homes, both new and existing. The supply of homes is still not meeting current demand leave alone pent-up demand. If the supply picture does not improve, home prices could shoot up further, causing many homebuyers to hold back on their purchase decisions. Rising Interest Rates Since the middle of 2012, homebuilders have largely benefited from historically low interest rates, eventually leading to the sharp increase in home buying activity. However, mortgage/interest rates are edging upwards to more normalized levels since May 2013. According to the Freddie Mac mortgage survey, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate has risen from 3.59% on May 23 to 4.34% as of Apr 10. High interest rates dilute demand for new homes, as mortgage loans become expensive. This lowers a buyer's purchasing power. This can hurt volumes, revenues and profits at the homebuilders. Homebuilders at large admitted that higher interest rates have eaten into volumes since the second half of 2013. But the homebuilders are also convinced that sluggish demand is only a fleeting phenomenon and buyers would soon return to the market overcoming their inhibitions of rising rates and climbing home prices. As discussed above, the Fed has also assured of a stable interest rate. In fact, while interest rates are an important part of the home buying business, sustainable increases in housing and housing demand for the long term will require the overall economy to strengthen. This means further job growth, improving household incomes, rising consumer confidence and easing of credit availability. The economy, while still improving slowly, is far from a full-fledged recovery. Until there is a more robust economic recovery, new home sales would continue to lag historical levels. Interestingly, with the rise in mortgage rates, lenders are beginning to ease credit standards to more normalized levels, which could in fact have a modest positive impact on demand. Rising Input Costs Rising input costs are a concern due to increasing costs of building material and labor. As housing starts accelerate, both labor and construction material costs would continue to experience upward pricing pressure, impeding future margins. Latest Performance of Key Players Despite rising interest rates and harsh weather, important housing companies like D.R. Horton and Pulte beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both revenue and earnings in the December quarter. This was largely due to aggressive pricing and margin growth, which made up for slowing order growth. However, New Jersey based Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. (NYSE: HOV) missed expectations on both counts due to delays in deliveries caused by severe weather, interruption of cabinet supply and construction labor shortages. Others like Toll Brothers beat earnings expectations on the back of strong margins, while missing out on the revenue consensus due to soft order growth and difficult year-ago comparisons. Among those which have already reported their results for the March quarter, Lennar and KB Home beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates for both revenue and earnings helped by better order trends, price increases and strong gross margins. Zacks Industry Rank Within the Zacks Industry classification, we rank all the 260 plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each industry. To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank. As a guideline, the outlook for industries in the top 1/3rd of all Industry Ranks or a Zacks Industry Rank of #88 and lower is 'Positive,' the middle 1/3rd or industries with Zacks Industry Rank between #89 and #176 is 'Neutral' and the bottom 1/3rd or Zacks Industry Rank of #177 and higher is 'Negative.' The Zacks Industry Rank for the construction industry is currently at #141. This is in the middle 1/3rd of all industries ranked, highlighting the group's near-term neutral outlook. The cautious stance reflects an albeit temporary pause after a harsh winter and the threat of rising interest rates before demand picks up in the upcoming spring selling season. Earnings Trends Looking at the overall results of the Construction sector, earnings shot up 13.9% in the December quarter, due mostly to pricing gains and strong margins -- a major decline from a 32.1% rise in the September quarter due to slower volumes. Total revenues were up 6.3% in the quarter versus a 9.2% rise a quarter ago. The sector racked up an earnings beat ratio (the percentage of companies coming out with positive surprises) of 63.6% and revenue beat ratio of 72.7% in the December quarter. In the first quarter, earnings and revenues are expected to grow 2.5% and 4.9%, respectively, with better growth rates expected in quarters thereafter as the sector regains momentum. For 2014, earnings are expected to show a 12.3% increase. Revenues are forecast to expand 8.1%. For more details about earnings for this sector and others, please read our latest ‘Earnings Trends.' Bottom Line Though the harsh winter and rising home prices did put the brakes on a housing recovery last quarter, homebuilders are increasingly optimistic of improving demand in the upcoming spring selling season. Many homebuilders noticed that both traffic and sales volume showed a steady improvement in January and February as they left the seasonally slowest months behind them. Our proprietary Zacks Ranks indicate the movement of stocks over the short term (1 to 3 months). At present, 16% of the stocks sport a bullish outlook while 62% are neutral.

2017-05-24,"Steel Analyst Says The Market's Become Too Bearish On China, Upgrades Entire Sector","Credit Suisse analyst Curt Woodworth upgraded the U.S. steel sector from Market Weight to Overweight, citing an overly bearish view of Chinese hot rolled coil and the pending results of the Department of Commerce’s investigation into the industry. The analyst also upgraded United States Steel Corporation (NYSE:X), Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) and Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) from Neutral to Outperform. A Look At Chinese Steel The analyst reiterated his forecast that hot rolled coil (HRC) will bottom out this summer at $580 per ton, noting that Chinese HRC prices are reverting to normalized levels, but now expects prices to recover in Q3. Rebar prices are also at multi-year highs. This data along with solid demand lead Woodworth to believe “the market has become too bearish on China.” See Also: Section 232 Public Hearing Wednesday Is 'Unlikely To Affect Steel Equities' Section 232 The Department of Commerce has been looking into the effects of steel imports on national security under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. “We believe the DoC will find some interrelationship between the health of the US steel industry and US national security, paving the way for [President Donald] Trump to implement additional layers of trade support for the industry,” said Woodworth. The analyst believes the market is underestimating changes in foreign producer behavior for five reasons: Presidential executive orders in support of steel. Trump’s proactive “steel triumvirate” of Wilbur Ross, Peter Navarro and Robert Lighthizer. The Department of Commerce’s Section 232 investigation. The Department of Commerce’s late invocation of the Particular Market Situation rule in the Korea oil country tubular goods (OCTG) ruling. Trump's mission to more aggressively enforce trade laws. Company Highlights Credit Suisse raised its price target for United States Steel to $29, and sees a pathway to approximately $1.3 billion of EBITDA by 2018 driven by oil country tubular goods. Steel Dynamics’ price target was upped $7 to $43 and the company is forecasted to see strong volume growth in the coming years as well as potential mergers and acquisitions. The analyst’s price target for Nucor was raised to $68, stating that the two main concerns — weak fundamentals in long products and excess HRC exposure — are fading."

Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

2019-04-08,Norfolk Southern Official Seeks To Calm Shippers' Anxiety,"Norfolk Southern's (NYSE:NSC) chief marketing officer sought to assuage shippers' concerns at a rail shippers' conference on April 5, saying his company would engage with shippers and seek opportunities to grow capacity as NSC transitions to the precision scheduled railroading (PSR) operating model. NSC chief marketing officer Alan Shaw said NSC has been working with shippers as it implements PSR, an operating model in which railcars run on a fixed schedule. Proponents say the model will encourage network efficiencies, but some shippers are still undecided on whether PSR will actually produce those promised efficiencies. Detractors of PSR have also said that precision railroading is a way for the Class I railroads to shed assets in order to lower their operating ratio and please Wall Street investors. Financial goals are a balance of growth and productivity. Growth has just as much of an input or leverage as productivity, Shaw said at the North East Association of Rail Shippers conference in Baltimore, Maryland. Some shippers have been wary about PSR because of the rapid pace with which CSX (NYSE:CSX) rolled out the operating model in 2017.The quick pace of the rollout, coupled by what some shippers thought was a lack of communication by CSX, caught the attention of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). Shaw said NSC will be rolling out PSR across its network over the next one to two years, which should ease the transition. We're going to engineer some of these changes and take a measured approach, Shaw said. He pointed to efforts such as clean sheeting, which is NSC's initiative to shed redundancies, a tenet of precision railroading. Shaw said NSC has been working with regional and local management to find ways to tighten the response windows for shippers' inquiries and clear out congestion in the rail yards. Reducing yard congestion frees up extra cars, tracks and locomotives, which can then be deployed elsewhere, rationalized or sold if NSC no longer needs them. That's the capacity dividend, Shaw said. Another way NSC will implement PSR is through retrofitting its locomotives so that they can run longer and heavier trains. Those trains will also be co-mingled, meaning for instance that trains and lanes previously dedicated towards intermodal movements might also now have coal cars as part of the train. Shaw said NSC will continue to invest 16 percent to 18 percent of its revenue on capital expenditure projects. The capital investments will be for maintenance and growth opportunities, including developing customer-interfacing software that will shed more light on the whereabouts of a shipper's railcars. NSC will also develop five operating metrics that will assist in tracking transit times, which could provide some opportunity for shippers and regulators alike to see how PSR is affecting day-to-day operations, he explained. The STB will be seeing our metrics as a way to gauge how the transition is coming along, Shaw said. Image sourced from Pixabay Want more content like this? Click here to Subscribe Permalink"

2016-06-15,What Sector ETFs Are Saying,"A simplistic view would be to say the Utilities SPDR ETF (NYSE: XLU) and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLE) are impressing this year. So is the Materials Select Sector SDPR (NYSE: XLB). Beyond that, there is not a lot to brag about among the major sector exchange-traded funds. The Sector ETF Story Of course, there is more to the sector ETF story. Amid heightened market volatility, investors have largely favored lower beta sectors such as utilities and consumer staples while the Federal Reserve's refusal to raise interest rates to this point in the year was previously a drag on the financial services, the second-largest sector weight in the S&P 500. More recently, once lagging financial services stocks and exchange-traded funds have recently sprung to life amid speculation the Federal Reserve is nearing its first interest rate increase of 2016, perhaps as soon as next month. Related Link: Add Some Pep To Utilities Allocations With This ETF Pay Attention To Shifts There are important shifts among sector ETFs currently at work investors should take note of. Investors are starting to show a preference for momentum names. “Take, for example, the consumer discretionary sector. As the chart above shows, it is trading very close to its 10-year high. But consumer discretionary is one of only two sectors, the other being health care, that reported positive earnings growth for the first quarter. Both sectors are also projected to post positive earnings growth for the full-year,” said State Street Vice President David Mazza in a recent note. Conversely, energy and financial services are the only sectors trading below their 10-year average valuations. In the case of energy, that does not necessarily mean the sector is inexpensive because contracting earnings are a main reason why valuations in the group are declining. Adding a little something to the case for financials is that the sector is expected to post positive EPS growth this year. Utilities, as has been widely, are richly valued relative an array of long-term averages, but with interest rates still low, investors continue embracing the sector. “Investors appear willing to pay up for sectors that have performed well, but they are not willing to do so for sectors like financials and energy, where there is a great deal of uncertainty around their future earnings stream. This might remain the case until investors get more clarity on future interest rates hikes and the outlook for the US economy from the Fed,” added Mazza."
2016-02-12,This Little Nugget Of An ETF Is Delivering Astounding Returns,"On Thursday, the Direxion Daily S&P Biotech Bear 3X Shares (NYSE: LABD), a leveraged bearish that is on a torrid pace this year, was highlighted. “Torrid” meaning LABD has nearly tripled in value since the start of the year. By now, it is fair to say that many investors are aware that one of this year's other hot asset classes in addition to bearish biotech ETFs is gold. Investors' thirst for safe-haven assets sent the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD), the world's largest gold exchange traded, higher by 4 percent Thursday to a new 52-week high. Gold, Gold, Gold A volatile start to 2016 for global equity markets has sent investors looking for safe-haven alternatives, and that search is benefiting gold exchange-traded products. Related Link: Gold Is In The Spotlight: Marc Cuban Thinks It Could Be A Safe Haven Of course, bullion's ascent is good news for gold miners and the relevant ETFs, which have a tendency to overshoot gold prices in either direction. That is exactly what the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners 3X Bull Shares (Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: JNUG)) is doing. With Thursday's gain of nearly 26.2 percent, JNUG is now up more than 92 percent this year. JNUG is the small-cap answer to the popular Direxion Daily Gold Miners Bull 3X Shares (Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT)) and the leveraged equivalent of the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). On a month-to-date basis, JNUG is up 88.6 percent, trailing only NUGT among Direxion's leveraged bullish ETFs. On Thursday, JNUG was the best-performing ETF in Direxion's stable, topping second-place NUGT by nearly 500 basis points. Predictably, JNUG's ascent is not free of volatility. For example, the ETF's 30-day variance versus its underlying index is 14.8 percent, good for the fourth-highest percentage among Direxion's bullish leveraged ETFs, according to issuer data. JNUG's recent volume increase has been surprisingly modest. Over the past five days, the ETF's volume is 10.2 percent higher than the trailing 20-day average, according to issuer data. What is interesting, though perhaps not surprising, is that traders are missing out on the fun with JNUG as the ETF has averaged $1.1 million in outflows per day over the past month.

2010-10-12,John Burbank At The Value Investing Congress,"John Burbank, of Passport Asset Management spoke at the Value Investing Congress, and said that political contributions in this country are done by just over 28,000 at their full maximum allowed, and if this tiny number was doubled, the political landscape could change drastically. Burbank believes that politics could blow up in the U.S., and he called for the U.S. to be studied like an emerging market. He said that the investment landscape should be viewed in 2 year intervals, and a majority of time and research should be spent focusing on Washington D.C. Burbank went on to say that the state of finances here in America are terrible, and it is time to address government revenue and spending. Burbank said at the Congress that he is short what he called Huge Debt, governments like U.S., Japan, the U.K., Italy, France and Spain. He advised investors to go long what he called New Cash, countries like Canada, Australia, Switzerland, Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand. He went on to say that he holds an 8% position in physical gold, not the Gold ETF (NYSE: GLD), and has been in gold miners, since 2002. Burbank said he has a major investment in a coking coal co. in Mozamibque. He also mentioned that he has some investments in blue chip Western companies, such as Exxon Mobil (NYSE: XOM), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Nestle, Kraft (NYSE: KFT), and Dr. Pepper (NYSE: DPS)."

2019-07-17,Shippers Want More Changes To Demurrage And Accessorial Charges,"Norfolk Southern (NYSE:NSC) and Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) are modifying some of the ways they collect demurrage and accessorial charges for some commodities, but some shippers are questioning the modifications. The changes are part of both companies' broader efforts to encourage shippers to turn railcars around faster and allow for a smoother transition to precision scheduled railroading, an operating model that streamlines operational schedules. But the shorter turnaround time-frames have resulted in hefty financial penalties for some shippers, prompting the Surface Transportation Board (STB) to host a two-day hearing on demurrage and accessorial charges in May. Shippers have also said they are penalized for the bunching of railcars even though they aren't at fault for the bunching, which is the delivery of too many railcars at once. The Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries (ISRI) submitted a letter to the STB on July 12 to express its concerns on NSC's recent revisions to its tariffs governing demurrage and storage and accessorial charges. Most of the revisions will go into effect on September 1. While ISRI appreciated some of the changes, the trade group said more modifications are needed to NSC's tariffs program. While several of the changes to the NSC tariffs would incrementally improve or eliminate certain egregious practices or charges, on the whole, they fall far short in addressing the serious concerns identified by ISRI members (and others), including the reasonableness of extremely limited credit days (i.e. zero days for private cars and 24 hours for railroad-owned cars), charges resulting from the bunching of cars, and invoicing and claims practices that create unfair obstacles to the efficient auditing and resolution of demurrage-related invoices and disputes, the ISRI letter said. NSC announced on July 1 that it was modifying its tariffs to introduce service credit eligibility for empty, private railcars. It is also revising its service credit program for loaded cars, and it said customers will be able to schedule diversions in advance of a railcar's arrival. These changes would go into effect on September 1. NSC also said that effectively immediately, customers will be able to dispute demurrage and storage charges without charge, and the railroad said it was in the process of reformatting and reviewing its tariff on switching. Meanwhile, UNP announced on July 2 that it would be updating its existing reservation system at certain intermodal terminals. The Intermodal Terminal Reservation System would replace the current Gate Reservation System at six West Coast intermodal terminals – East Coast Los Angeles, LATC, City of Industry, Lathrop, Brooklyn and TacSim. UNP will also roll out the technology at additional domestic terminals. UNP said the new reservation system, which will be implemented starting on August 6, will allow for better planning of drays and ingates. But a shipper told FreightWaves it is concerned about the new accessorial fees of $25 for reservations cancelled less than 24 hours prior to the gate cutoff and $50 for reservation no-shows. UNP said in its notice that the new reservation system will match customer reservations more closely with train capacity and terminal fluidity. The railroad also said it would apply a $100 credit for each individual unit that ingates before cutoff and does not depart on its corresponding train. Implementation of the fees and the credit would not begin until September 3. UNP will release its second quarter results on July 18, while NSC will report its results on July 24.

2023-06-05,"This Dublin Gravel Supplier Is Undervalued Compared To Rivals VMC, MLM: Here's Why","A construction supply company stands to benefit from recent U.S. government initiatives. What Happened: According to Street Sheet, traders would be wise to consider CRH plc (LON: CRH), which currently touts a $35.4 billion market cap. The Dublin-based company will likely see an uptick in demand for its products, which are used to make concrete, cement, and asphalt. Why? Because some $2 trillion in spending will pour into the economy due to three pieces of legislation: The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in November 2021. The Inflation Reduction Act, enacted by President Joe Biden last August. The Chips Act, which provides tax credits and subsidies for domestic U.S. semiconductor manufacturers. See Also: Dow Drops Over 100 Points, Crude Oil Rises CRH is an undervalued stock to watch, Street Sheet explained, citing the growing need for building supplies as new battery plants and chip facilities get built. The stock gained 23% during the past 12 months, but it currently trades at 11x the estimated 2024 earnings, whereas its competitors — Martin Marietta Materials (NYSE:MLM) and Vulcan Materials (NYSE:VMC) — trade at 22x and 25x forward earnings, respectively. Why It Matters: CRH, which stands for Cement Roadstone Holdings, is in the process of moving its primary stock market listing to the U.S. This will help CRH establish stateside recognition and close the valuation gaps it has with its rivals. Reporting rules in the U.S. will also make it easier to compare CRH to its two American competitors: MLM and VMC. That could, in turn, drive the stock higher. Meanwhile, commercial construction activity in the U.S. was up 19% in March year-over-year, and road construction is up 20%. More of the same, if not better, can be in the cards for soon-to-be US-listed CRH, Street Sheet predicts.

2010-05-11,Gold Makes New 52 Week High (GLD) ,"The SPDR Gold Trust ETF (NYSE: GLD) made a new all time high today, as sovereign debt fears continue to drive the price for the precious metal higher. The GLD briefly touched $119.89, which is the highest level ever for the ETF. Trading volume has already surpassed the daily average, with 16.34 million shares exchanging hands versus an average of 15.99 million. At this point, gold is pretty much a must have component of any portfolio. As a result of governments around the world spending way beyond their means, paper currencies are looking like a very unattractive asset class. This very well may just be the beginning of a substantial move higher in the GLD."

2010-06-21,Summer Camps  06-21-2010,"Cusick’s Corner The market continued to pull back into the After Hours but was able to hold key support, SPX 1110. While the Yuan news was a potentially nice boost for market sectors that we mentioned in the Midday, it only incited the Deflationary or Disinflation camps who believe that this is either a rouse by the Chinese or they just fired their last proverbial bullet before the G20 meeting. Speaking of meetings -- there is a two-day Fed meeting and the market will be watching to see if there’s any inflation and if keeping it in check is still the only storyline, plus if there’s any language that surfaces about disinflation. Existing Home sales due out at 10:00am ET -- watch to see if there is a dramatic pullback in the pool of buyers in the face of the tax credits being pulled. See you Midday. Stocks traded broadly higher early, but then gave back the gains and the major averages finished with modest losses Monday. The table was set for gains on Wall Street after Asia’s equity markets cheered news that China was abandoning the peg between the yuan and the US dollar. The link between the two currencies was implemented two years ago during the global financial crisis and the change in policy signals greater confidence in China’s economy, as well as a more open trade policy from China. However, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied as much as 140 points in morning trading, the gains were short-lived and market action had turned mixed by midday. There were no domestic earnings or economic news to guide the action and, stocks slumped into the close. After a four-day winning streak, the Dow close down 9 points on the session. The tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 20.7. Bullish Flow Amgen (AMGN) shares gained $1.32 to $56.52 and seemed to benefit from news that Affymax’s (AFFY) anemia drug, Hematide, resulted in greater health risks, including heart attacks. AFFY plummeted 68.8 percent on the news. Meanwhile, AMGN, which produces its own anemia drug, jumped higher and options volume hit 2.5X the average daily, with about 30,000 calls and 10,000 puts traded. The top trades included some apparent diagonal spreads, where one more investors were selling October 55 calls and buying January 62.5 calls, 5000X in morning action. The spread is possibly a bet that AMGN will hold around $55 through the October expiration, and then rally during the three months that follow. Bullish order flow was also seen in Revlon (REV), Alcoa (AA), and Heinz (HNZ). Bearish Flow General Mills (GIS) shares lost 59 cents to $37.95 and put volume surged, with roughly 33,000 contracts traded on the day. The volume represents 18X normal and compares to 4,400 calls. The action was focused on July 37.5 puts, which traded 13,400X. August 35, August 37.5, and July 36 puts saw interest as well. There was no company specific news to explain the action, but implied volatility rose nearly 9 percent to 25, suggesting demand for put options was driving up options premiums in the food company Monday. Bearish flow also picked up in Emerson Electric (EMR), AMD, and Micron Technology (MU). Index Trading Options action picked up in the Russell 2000 Small Cap Fund (.RUT) Monday. The index, which tracks the share price action of 2000 of the smallest US-listed companies, gave up early gains and finished the day down 6.89 to 660.03. In the options market, 135,000 puts and 54,000 calls traded on the index. The top trades were in the July 550 – 560 put options, which traded more than 42,000X each. Looks like bullish spread traders were taking positions, paying about $1.10 for the 550s and collecting $1.40 on the 560s, possibly betting that the Russell will hold above 560 through the July expiration (25 days). ETF Trading Select Sector Basic Materials Fund (XLB) added 19 cents to $31.14 Monday and options volume hit 8.5X the average daily, with 81,000 puts and 35,000 calls traded. The top trades were in the July 30 – 32 put spread, which was bought at 70 cents, 30000X in morning trading. That is, an investor – probably an institution – bought 30,000 of the July 32 puts at $1.10 and sold 30,000 July 30 puts at 40 cents. The spread offers a potential pay-off (excluding commissions) of $1.60 if shares of the fund fall to $30 or less by the July expiration."
2015-06-22,Sterne Agee CRT Downgrades Alcoa On 'Lack Of Catalysts',"In a report published Monday, Sterne Agree CRT analyst Josh W. Sullivan downgraded the rating on Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA) to Neutral, while lowering the price target from $17 to $12. The stock offers limited risk/reward benefits, given the lack of near term catalysts. Alcoa is currently working through a difficult period of its portfolio transformation, along with facing fundamental risks to its commodity business. In the last 12 months, Alcoa has made a historic transformation. However, AA has to now aggressively execute on integration to meet its targets, Sullivan stated. Although the company has radically modified its cost structure, global trends seen in 2014 are now reversing. The company has also successfully achieved a generational portfolio shift over the past 12 months, limiting high cost commodity operations and increasing its value-added exposure. This strategy ensures the longevity of the company; however, in the intermediate-term there are hurdles to meeting goals in the value added business, and unfortunately, less support from the commodity portfolio as there was in 2014, the Sterne Agee CRT report explained. Alcoa has been able to meaningfully increase aerospace exposure via Firth Rixon, RTI International Metals, Inc. (NYSE: RTI) and Tital. Within Global Rolled Products (GRP) it is a tale of two cities as Body-in-White (BiW) contributions may be masked by foreign competition/additional portfolio actions. In the long run, divesting lower value assets will improve overall profitability but do create hurdles in the near-term, Sullivan added."
2010-03-25,"Stock Market News for March 25, 2010 - Market News","Stocks retreated Wednesday after two days of winning run as sovereign debt worries and a downgrade of Portugal’s credit rating revived concerns about the global economy. Benchmark indexes pulled back from their 18-month highs and the dollar raced to a 10-month high against the euro as investors chose to eschew equities. Fitch Rating’s downgrade of Portugal’s sovereign credit rating due to the country’s shaky public finances sent investors into a tizzy as concerns grew rising debts in eurozone countries could hamper a nascent global economic recovery. Treasuries declined in price after an auction of $42 billion 5-year notes witnessed lackluster response. As prices fell, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note jumped to 3.83% from 3.68%. The yield on the five-year note rose to 2.59% from 2.42%. This week the government plans to auction $118 billion of notes. The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 52.68 points, or 0.5%, to close at 10,836.15. The broader S&P 500 was 0.6%, with telecom, consumer staples and utilities leading the decliners. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.7%. On the New York Stock Exchange, declining shares beat those that advanced in price by a 2 to 1 margin, as volume jumped to a moderate 1.025 billion shares. The decline was broad-based yesterday, with twenty-two of the thirty DJIA components closing the day in the red. Verizon (NYSE:VZ) shares led the decliners, off 1.7% after rival telecommunications company Sprint (NYSE:S), up 2.9%, launched the first phone to provide super high speeds; AT&T (NYSE:T) shares retreated 1.1% on increased competition in the sector. A surging dollar sent prices of commodities priced in the currency lower and weakened resource-related stocks. Alcoa (NYSE:AA) declined 1.2%, while Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM) and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) fell 3.4% and 1.6%, respectively. A greater-than-anticipated 7.2 million barrel build in weekly US crude inventory and a stronger dollar sent Chevron (NYSE:CVX) down 1.1% and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) off 0.7%. Oil prices eased 1.6%, or $1.30, to $80.61 per barrel. Leading the gainers on the DJIA was Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), up 2.6%, after it announced plans to expand its operations in China and Asia and forgive mortgage debt among certain distressed subprime borrowers. Disney (NYSE:DIS) shares advanced 1.1% on news of price increases of movie tickets. General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares added 0.7% to their prior day’s tally after Bernstein increased its price target on the stock, citing improved prospects for near-term credit at its financial unit. Among the S&P500 industry sectors, only financials (+0.1%) managed gains, even as chances of enactment of Senator Dodd's financial reform bill grew stronger. Telecommunication shares led the decliners (-1.2%), followed by utilities (-1.0%), consumer goods (-0.9%), health care (-0.9%), industrials (-0.8%), oil and gas (-0.7%), technology (-0.6%), consumer services (-0.5%) and basic materials (-0.2%). Meanwhile, chances of International Monetary Fund stepping in to save debt-ridden Greece grew stronger, even as EU policy makers meet in Brussels to address economic concerns overshadowed by the Greek and Portuguese problems. Today's Fed-speak calendar includes remarks from Fed Chairman Bernanke, as well as its Pianalto and Kohn.

2015-04-20,"Analyst: Watch Steel Dynamics' Inventory Outlook, It's Key","Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: STLD) is likely to post a 65 percent sequential decline in first-quarter earnings after the bell Monday, but an analyst said investors will focus on prospects for an improved second quarter. The Fort Wayne, Indiana-based steel company said last month that pricing had declined to globally competitive levels, and Deutsche Bank's Jorge Beristain said that might help remove surplus inventory that has held down profits. The focus will be on color around recent market developments, according to Beristain, who will look for information on inventories, pricing, imports and order trends when the company confers with analysts on Tuesday morning. Related Link: Despite The Plunge In Steel Prices, Deutsche Bank Remains Bullish On These Steel Stocks Continued strength in demand from U.S. automakers, and manufacturing, plus construction sectors should lead to a stronger second quarter, Beristain said. Analysts expect the company will post first-quarter earnings of $0.15 a share, down from $0.40 for the December quarter. Separately, Clarkson analyst Lee McMillan last week launched coverage on Steel Dynamics with a Hold rating and $19 target, citing its 22 percent stock price run-up in the past three months. McMillan thinks the outlook for construction will help the company's fabrication unit while falling scrap prices bode well for its mill operations. But lower prices for raw materials will cause continued losses at Steel Dynamics' Minnesota operations, McMillan said."
2018-11-27,Steel Stocks Have Wall Street's Attention,"The U.S. steel industry has had a volatile couple of years with fluctuations in steel prices and uncertainty surrounding the fate of steel tariffs in an ongoing trade war. This week, several Wall Street analysts weighed in on steel stocks ahead of the G20 summit of world leaders. New Steel Mill After Monday's market close, Steel Dynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ:STLD) announced plans to build a new $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion electric-arc-furnace (EAF) carbon sheet steel mill in the U.S. KeyBanc analyst Philip Gibbs said Steel Dynamics investors may have mixed feelings about the new mill. “U.S. carbon sheet-based stocks will likely be weaker tomorrow on the potential for further U.S. supply growth, while STLD investors may be a bit disappointed via potential for less bandwidth to pursue full-out share buyback momentum ($729M left at September's end),” Gibbs wrote in a note. Gibbs said the prospect of more steel supply in the U.S. market will likely weigh on steel prices and maintains a Sector Weight rating for Steel Dynamics stock. Steel Price Forecast On Tuesday, Longbow Research lowered its 2019 HRC steel spot price target by $10 to $15/ton and is now calling for 2019 prices to range between $790 and $795/ton. The new target represents roughly 5 percent downside from 2018 average prices. Despite the bearish adjustment, Longbow analyst Chris Olin reiterated his Buy rating and $40 price target for U.S. Steel (NYSE:X). “We believe the shares are significantly undervalued, even after adjusting for potential market headwinds,” Olin said. Sentiment Falling UBS analyst Andreas Bokkenheuser said net sentiment for the steel group declined in the third quarter. “Average Net Sentiment for all producers remained above global peers (possibly on account of Section 232 support), but directionally still down. We note that Net Sentiment serves as a potential leading indicator for operational performance,” Bokkenheuser wrote in a note. He said U.S. Steel has the highest net sentiment in the quarter, followed by Steel Dynamics, Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) and AK Steel Holding Corporation (NYSE:AKS). UBS has the following ratings and price targets for the U.S. steel group: Nucor: Neutral, $63 target. Steel Dynamics: Neutral, $48 target. U.S. Steel: Sell, $28 target. AK Steel: Sell, $3.25 target.

2019-06-25,"'Fast Money' Traders Talk Gold, Defensive Stocks And More","On CNBC’s “Fast Money” on Monday, Guy Adami said gold mining stocks like SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) and VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) are breaking out to the upside and continue to have room to run. Tim Seymour added that typical risk-aversion stocks like McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) are defensive stocks that are likely going higher and that valuations don't matter. Dan Nathan said with gold and defensive stocks moving higher, the warning signs are screaming in silence and said if the market is going to breakout to meaningful highs, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) will have to get back to prior highs. Brian Kelly said there are signs of weakening and is cautious because we have had such a run. He doesn't have a lot of equity exposure at this time. Adami said if the market were as strong as everyone wants it to be, the iShares Russell 2000 Index (NYSE:IWM) should be higher.

2014-05-19,U.S. Directly Accuses Chinese Government Of Online Economic Espionage,"For the first time ever, the United States formally accused a foreign power of engaging in cyber-spying against U.S companies in order to steal trade secrets. On Monday, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced indictments against five officers in China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) for “serious cybersecurity breaches” against six American firms: Westinghouse Electric, a division of Toshiba (OTC: TOSBF) , Alcoa (NYSE: AA), Allegheny Technologies (NYSE: ATI), U.S. Steel (NYSE: X), the United Steelworkers Union and SolarWorld (OTC: SRWRY). The five PLA officers are reportedly in China, and it is unlikely that Beijing will hand them over to the United States. Related: Russia Threatens To Cut Off Gas To Ukraine, Preparing For 'Historic' Energy Deal With China Holder said the indictments marked the first time charges had been brought against “known state actors” for hacking into U.S. commercial targets. “In sum, the alleged hacking appears to have been conducted for no reason other than to advantage state-owned companies and other interests in China,” he said in a prepared statement, “at the expense of businesses here in the United States. This is a tactic that the U.S. government categorically denounces.” China's Foreign Affairs Ministry denied the U.S. claims. “The Chinese government, the Chinese military and their relevant personnel have never engaged or participated in cyber theft of trade secrets,” it said in a statement. The U.S. accusation against Chinese personnel is purely ungrounded and absurd.” China also took the U.S. government to task over its own, highly-publicized online surveillance activities. Last year, the New York Times ran a lengthy report on China's extensive efforts to break into American corporations, organizations and government agencies via a special, Shanghai-based cyber-intelligence unit. But Monday's announcement, says one analyst, is ground-breaking. Frank Cilluffo, head of the Homeland Security Policy Institute at the George Washington University, told Reuters it indicates “that DOJ has 'smoking keyboards' and [is] willing to bring the evidence to a court of law and be more transparent. Bonnie Glaser, a senior Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says the carefully-prepared indictments also indicate that U.S. diplomatic efforts to discourage such cyber-hacking by China have not worked. “The Chinese have ignored U.S. requests to stop stealing U.S. companies’ intellectual property,” she told the Washington Post. “The U.S. believes it is necessary to impose consequences for China’s actions.”"

2011-03-02,"Morning In America Part 2? (CSX, BRK-A, UNP, NSC)","The Challenger job cuts for February was the first positive number we've seen in over two years, with a 20% reading. The prior reading was -46.1%, which is a far cry from 20%. Perhaps we are starting to see the turn around in the jobs front in this country, which would be a welcomed sight for all Americans, employed or not. This morning, ADP reported a better than expected number for February private payrolls, reporting a gain of 217,000 jobs versus the estimates of 165,000. Warren Buffett also believes that unemployment is on a turn around, and could hit as low as 7% by 2012. There is a resiliency to the American system, Buffett remarked. It does work. It sputters from time to time, it will sputter from time to time, but you don't want to get worried. Buffett said that he believes hiring at Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) will pick up this year, especially in the tank car industry, which makes rail cars used by companies CSX (NYSE: CSX), Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) and Norfolk Southern (NYSE: NSC). He said that the railroad business is about 60% of the way back, which is extremely positive on the long term outlook for the American economy. It's very possible that the long term unemployment rate in America will drop sharply, faster than most expect, as productivity gains have largely been made, and hiring will start to begin. Ronald Reagan made the Morning In America speech popular years ago. It looks like that time may be happening again, this time on the jobs front."
2012-10-01,Earnings Expectations for the Week of October 1,"October marks a new month and a new quarter. Autumn is underway, and here is a look at what analysts expect to see from this week's quarterly reports from Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ), Family Dollar (NYSE: FDO), Marriott International (NYSE: MAR), Monsanto (NYSE: MON) and Mosaic (NYSE: MOS). Family Dollar Fourth-quarter fiscal 2012 earnings from this variety store chain operator are forecast to come to $0.75 per share, while revenues totaled $2.36 billion. In the same quarter of last year, the company beat EPS estimates when it posted $0.66 per share and $2.13 billion in sales. Note that Family Dollar earnings typically come within pennies per share of the consensus forecast; the third-quarter EPS narrowly missed the estimate. The full-year forecast has EPS up more than 14 percent to $3.64 and revenue about nine percent higher to $9.33 billion. Family Dollar steps into the earnings spotlight Wednesday before the markets open. See also: Family Dollar Reaches Preliminary Class Action Settlement Marriott International Analysts predict that this hospitality company will say Wednesday that it saw a profit of $0.40 per share in the third quarter. That would be up from $0.29 per share in the same period a year ago, and unchanged from the consensus EPS estimate of 60 days ago. The company fell short of EPS expectations once in the past four quarters; earnings were in line with the consensus estimate in the second quarter. Revenues for the third quarter are expected to have slipped almost eight percent year-over-year to $2.65 billion. So far, the full-year forecast has EPS up more than 21 percent but revenue more than five percent lower. See also: First JW Marriott Hotel Opens in New York City Mosaic The world's largest producer of phosphate and second-largest producer of potash is expected to report Tuesday morning that for its first quarter of fiscal 2013 it had earnings of $1.16 per share. That would be down marginally from the same period in the previous year. Lower EPS exceeded the consensus estimate in the fourth quarter, but earnings have fallen short in two of the past six quarters. Analysts on average expect first-quarter revenues to total $2.54 billion, which would be short of last year's reported figure of $3.08 billion. In the fourth quarter, revenue fell less than two percent year-over-year to $2.82 billion. See also: Mosaic and Other Fertilizer Producers Pull Back Constellation Brands Constellation Brands is the largest wine producer in the world and the largest beer importer in the United States. The company is expected to report Friday that fiscal second-quarter earnings fell almost 30 percent from the same period of last year to $0.54 per share. That would follow two quarters of year-on-year EPS increases. Ninety days ago, the consensus EPS estimate called for $0.57. Revenue for the quarter is predicted to have inched up about three percent to $710 million. So far, analysts expect sequential and year-over-year growth of both revenue and per-share earnings in the current quarter. See also: Top 4 Stocks in the Beverages, Wineries and Distillers Industry with the Lowest PEG Ratio Monsanto In its Wednesday morning report, this St. Louis-based agricultural biotechnology corporation is expected report a net loss of $0.43 per share for its fiscal fourth quarter. That compares to a net loss of $0.22 per share in the year-ago quarter, as well as a consensus estimate of a $0.44 loss from 60 days ago. But Monsanto's EPS results have been better-than-expected in the past six quarters. Fourth-quarter revenues are expected to total $2.25 billion, which would be the same as a year ago. The full-year forecast calls for EPS more than 20 percent higher to $3.72 and revenue up more than 15 percent to $13.65 billion.

2010-08-02,"Materials Stocks On Fire (CLF, FCX, AA, X)","Materials stocks are surging today as traders place their bets that the global economic recovery will continue after stronger-than-expected manufacturing reports out of China and the U.S. Materials are closely tied to economic growth and are highly cyclical. If growth is strong such names will outperform; conversely, if the economy enters into recession these stocks get hammered. Here are how some key names are faring today: Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF) is up $3.60, or 6.36%, to $60.17. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold (NYSE: FCX) is surging $3.16, or 4.42%, to $74.70.

Materials are often good leading indicators and are thus signaling that the market correction may be over for now while global growth continues for the remainder of 2010."
2012-09-07,September Could be Kind to These ETFs,"On a historical basis, September is usually unkind to stocks and investors have been reminded of that in ample doses since the start of the month. The good news is September's sour reputation does not mean there are not opportunities to be had. In fact, there are a few ETFs that can comfort investors this month. Perhaps the best thing is that the funds on this list are not leveraged, so conservative investors can embrace a couple of these picks, too. Here are the ETFs to be involved with from the long side this month: iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) Or the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) or any ETF backed by physical gold for that matter. IAU makes the cut here because it has a lower expense ratio than GLD. Additionally, IAU has slightly outperformed GLD year-to-date. Regardless of which gold ETF investors choose, historical data indicate gold is a wise move from the long side this month. In the past 25 Septembers, gold prices have increased 19 times. Factoring in the six years when gold prices slid in September, gold's average September gain is almost 2.7 percent, according to Dorsey Wright. iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index Fund (NYSE: IYR) The real estate sector has been a decent performer over the past 20 Septembers, rising 12 times and falling on eight occasions. The average gain in the 12 up Septembers outpaces the average loss by 50 basis points, according to Dorsey Wright. IYR is already up 17.3 percent year-to-date and that might imply the fund is due for a September pullback. Past performance probably is not the biggest near-term risk facing this ETF. Valuation might be. IYR sports a P/E ratio of almost 45 and a price/book ratio of nearly 3.5, according to iShares data. On the other hand, a 30-day SEC yield of 3.56 percent is decent in this environment and that could be enough to send yield-hungry investors into this fund as September moves along. U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) Embracing a risky asset such as oil futures would appear to be the opposite of what would be deemed a practical September. The data support such a move. Over the past 16 Septembers, oil futures have risen nine times and fallen seven times. Not a big margin favor of the bulls, but the Dorsey Wright data indicate crude's average gain over those nine Septembers is 120 basis points better than the average loss. PowerShares DWA Technical Leaders Portfolio (NYSE: PDP) The PowerShares DWA Technical Leaders Portfolio tracks an index based on relative strength methodology, which is to say the ETF is home to 101 stocks showing bullish relative strength characteristics. On the surface, PDP would be appear to be a fund more geared toward a risk on environment because consumer discretionary and financial services names combine for almost 50 percent of the ETF's weight. The index has jumped in 10 of the past 15 Septembers, though it should be noted the average loss in the five down Septembers is much higher than the average gain. PDP has almost $617 million in assets under management and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the ETF's largest holding with an allocation of 3.53 percent. For more on ETFs, click here."

2013-11-19,Indian Gold Buyers Listen to America's Central Banker Rather Than Their Finance Minister,"For almost two years, P. Chidambaram, the Finance Minister of India, has done much to make gold as unappealing as possible to buyers in his country. Speeches have been given. Tariffs have been raised. But purchasing by Indians continues at a pace to set a record next year for gold. That is very bullish for companies in the gold sector such as Barrick Gold (NYSE: ABX), Goldcorp (NYSE: GG), Wishbone Gold (OTC: WISHY) and Yamana Gold (NYSE: AUY). Overall, Indian imports of gold are expected to reach 350–400 tons for the April to June 2013 period, according to Sharps Pixley, a broker in London. That is 200 percent higher than a year ago. For 2013, Sharps Pixley predicts that the demand for gold in India will reach a record 1,000 tons. While the Indian Finance Minister has been making the case against gold, America's next central banker just made a strong case for it. In testimony before Congress, Dr. Janet Yellen, the nominee to be the next Chair of the Federal Reserve, endorsed the continuation of Quantitative Easing III. That is a policy designed to keep interest rates low by having the Federal Reserve acquire $85 billion monthly in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed bonds through expanding its balance sheet. Related: 3 Stocks to Profit from Emerging Consumer Markets That should result in higher inflation in the future, as trillions in Greenbacks are being created without being backed by economic growth, as previously detailed. When that happens, gold should rise in value. Historically, gold rises in value along with inflation. Investors flee paper money for hard assets such as precious metals. From that, the price of gold and the shares of Barrick Gold, Wishbone Gold, Yamana Gold, Goldcorp and the exchange-traded fund for gold, SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) should all rise. That has not happened in 2013, however. For the year, SPDR gold shares have fallen more than 20 percent. But there is good news in the sector. Barrick Gold is rumored to be the target of activist investors, according to an article in Barron's. Wishbone Gold just reported positive results for its holdings in Australia. Both China and India, the world's two largest consumers of gold, are buying. That and more inflation should lead to higher prices in the future for gold."
2020-08-10,Tesla Paid Nearly $100M To Acquire Texas Gigafactory Land,"Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) paid nearly $100 million for the 2,000-acre land on which it plans to build its latest gigafactory, Electrek reported Sunday. What Happened The former owner of the property, TXI Operations LP, a unit of Martin Marietta Inc (NYSE:MLM), revealed in an earnings call on July 28 that it sold a “depleted standing gravel location” for $97 million, as earlier reported by local Austin media. TXI IOperations didn't give further details on the property it sold, or the name of the buyer, but according to Electrek, the reference is to none other than Tesla's under-construction manufacturing facility near Austin, Texas. The electric vehicles maker had purchased the land through its subsidiary Colorado River Project, LLC. Why It Matters Heavy machinery has been spotted at the site since the last month, on all days of the week, Electrek noted. The scale of the upcoming factory is impressive and the new facility could potentially become one of the world's largest buildings, upon completion. CEO Elon Musk said on the company’s second-quarter earnings call that the Texas factory would have walking paths and other natural features for the public to enjoy. The Gigafactory would primarily be used to build the company’s all-electric pickup vehicle, the Cybertruck. Price Action Tesla shares closed 2.48% lower at $1,452.71 on Friday."

Here is a day-by-day rundown of some of the most anticipated quarterly reports of this week. Monday Third-quarter reports from Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT) and Netflix (NYSE: NFLX) will be among Monday's highlights.

2015-06-08,"Freeport-McMoRan, Glu Mobile And Others Insiders Have Been Buying","With the markets still near all-time highs after a long bull run, investors have had to get more selective when it comes to stocks. As Barron's recently pointed out, insider buying can be an encouraging signal. Conventional wisdom says that insiders and beneficial owners really only buy shares of a company for one reason -- they believe the stock price will rise and they want to profit from it. Recently, the most significant insider buys have been of the likes of American Homes 4 Rent, Freeport-McMoRan and Glu Mobile. American Homes 4 Rent One director has been buying up shares since March. So far in June that director bought almost 815,000 American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE: AMH) shares at prices ranging from $16.77 to $16.87. That came to more $13.72 million. The total stake is now more than 3 million shares. This Malibu-based real estate investment trust has a market capitalization near $3.5 billion and a dividend yield of about 1.2 percent. Strong revenue growth is predicted for the current quarter and the full year, but note that the return on equity is in the red. Shares ended last week at $16.48. See also: Will Jorge Paulo Lemann Buy Diageo? Shares Rocket On Rumor Associated Banc-Corp The CEO, CFO, other executives and two directors accumulated a total of more than 53,000 shares of this Green Bay, Wisconsin-based bank holding company last week. At $25.00 per share, that was worth $1.34 million. This was in the wake of the resolution to a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development investigation. The market cap of Associated Banc Corp (NYSE: ASB) is around $3 billion, and the dividend yield is about 2.1 percent. The operating margin is greater than the industry average. The share price hit a multiyear high on Friday and closed at $19.75. Freeport-McMoRan As copper prices retreated from year-to-date highs in May, and with the share price pulling back as well, the vice chairman of the board purchased 60,000 Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX) at $20.52 apiece. Last week's transaction cost him around $1.23 million. This Phoenix, Arizona-based natural resource company has a market cap of more than $20 billion and a dividend yield near 1.0 percent. Here too the return on equity is in the red, but the long-term earnings per share (EPS) growth forecast is about 12 percent. Shares ended Friday's trading session at $19.65. Glu Mobile Tencent Holdings acquired 8.5 million shares of Glu Mobile Inc. (NASDAQ: GLUU), bringing its total stake to 21 million shares, in accordance with a previously announced investment plan. Last week's purchase totaled $51 million, at $6.00 per share. Glu Mobile's market cap is around $810 million. The long-term EPS growth forecast of this San Francisco-based game maker is less than 5 percent, but the operating margin is greater than the industry average. The stock closed Friday at $6.71, so a well-timed by by Tencent. Martin Marietta One Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. (NYSE: MLM) director recently bought more than 31,000 shares. At prices ranging from $150.16 to $151.45 per share, that came to more than $4.69 million. The transactions came as shares backed off of a recent multiyear high. This $10 billion market cap construction materials company has a long-term EPS growth forecast of about 11 percent and a dividend yield of about 1.1 percent. Continuing the recent slide, shares closed at $148.10 on Friday. The stock is up more than 34 percent since the beginning of the year. See also: Electric Dump Trucks? Tesla Co-Founder Says Yes Tutor Perini The chairman and CEO has purchased more than 133,000 shares of Tutor Perini Corp (NYSE: TPC) at prices ranging from $20.94 to 22.61.

The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is higher than the industry average, and the long-term EPS growth forecast is about 12 percent. Shares were changing hands at $22.88 on Friday's close, after rising more than 10 percent last week. At the time of this writing, the author had no position in the mentioned equities."
2020-11-06,Gold Prices Surge As Dollar Drops,"Gold has been benefiting from a weak U.S. dollar and the uncertainty of the U.S. election outcome, with Democratic nominee Joe Biden in the lead but no election calls yet. Gold made gains this week and was trading at $1,952.28 per ounce at last check Friday. While the potential election of Joe Biden means a lot to various segments of the capital markets, I think the cake was baked for gold long before the vote, said Fosterville South Exploration CEO Bryan Slusarchuk . Bull Market For Gold: Regardless of who wins the election, the setup for a once-in-a-lifetime bull market in gold was in place due to bipartisan support for quantitative easing, unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus and a low-to-negative interest rate policy, said Slusarchuk. Gold is a currency, and right now it is the only currency in the world not being printed with reckless abandon in an effort to stave off a huge financial depression, he said. Therefore, inherently gold is becoming more valuable versus its competitors every day. I expect this to continue because quite simply the Fed can’t print more gold. As the uncertainty around the election continues, gold's strength over the mid- and long-term is underpinned by economic and financial conditions. “There is no doubt we may see some short-term fluctuations based on the extreme animosity between the two sides during the counting phase of the election and the fact that the election is being contested,” Slusarchuk said. The climate represents the best set of conditions for gold ever seen, the CEO said. Price Action: The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD) was up 0.14% at $183.19 at the close Friday. The VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE:GDX) was up 0.49% at $41.42. Related Link: Should You Invest In Gold Right Now?"
2016-11-04,How To Trade Gold During This Election Week,"A number of new polls show the 2016 presidential election race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is tightening heading into the final days of the campaign. If there’s one thing that financial markets don't like, it's uncertainty, and the election seems to be providing more than enough. Stocks have understandably struggled as the race has tightened, and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) is now down 2.9 percent in the past month alone. However, defensive safe-haven investments like gold have been on fire. Investors looking to hedge against the financial market fallout from a potential Trump victory have been pouring into gold and gold ETFs. In the past five trading sessions, the SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) is up 2.3 percent, the Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDX) is up 6.4 percent and the Direxion Shares Exchange Traded Fund Trust (NYSE: NUGT) is up 19.8 percent. Between now and November 8, gold and gold and gold stocks will likely continue to trade up and down in-line with Trump’s poll numbers. A Clinton victory coupled with Republicans maintaining control of Congress would likely be seen as good news for stocks and bad news for gold. A pair of new polls on Thursday by CBS News/New York Times and ABC/Washington Post show Clinton with a 2-3 point lead over Trump. New polls by the LA Times/USC and Rasmussen Reports give Trump a 3-5 point lead. The latest IBD/TIPP Tracking poll shows the race a dead tie."
2011-01-28,"Markets Freak Over Riots, Earnings","The Dollar soared higher today, as riots spread across the middle east and northern Africa. The PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (NYSE: UUP) was trading up $22.49, +0.14 (+0.60%). This constant move higher throughout the day has crushed the markets. Global instability fears are driving investors to the Dollar. In response, gold is soaring. Usually, when the Dollar rises, gold would drop. But just like investors are rushing to the Dollar for safety, the same thing for gold. The SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE: GLD) is ripping higher, trading at $131.32, +3.40 (+2.65%). Oil is also soaring, as the middle east instability could mean oil is harder to produce and ship to other countries. The United States Oil Fund LP (NYSE: USO) is trading at $37.45, +1.51 (+4.20%). In addition to all the issues throughout the world, earnings were poor on many key stocks. Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) is getting crushed, down 15% while Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is down 10%. All this combined, is making for a drastic drop in the markets. This monster drop may be the start of something bigger. It has the potential to start a correction in this market of 10%.

2015-07-24,Best And Worst ETFs Of The Week Amid Consumer Discretionary Strength,"After briefly touching a new intra-day high this week, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE: SPY) fell back below its 50-day moving average and has once again inserted itself into a broad trading range. Investors are likely feeling frustrated this year with the bifurcated nature of the markets that has seen growth sectors soar, while value names collapse. Perhaps the strongest sector this week was the Consumer Discretionary SPDR (ETF) (NYSE: XLY), which added to gains on the back of strong quarterly results from Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX). This all-important gauge of consumer activity is showing no signs of slowing down this year after hitting new highs. The following ETFs represent a sample of the best- and worst-performing funds over the last five trading sessions. BEST: Long Duration Treasury Bonds One of the best performing asset classes this week was long-duration Treasury bonds, as a flight to quality sent interest rates markedly lower. The PIMCO 25 Yr Zro Cupn US Ty Inx Fd ETF (NYSE: ZROZ) gained nearly 4 percent since last Friday’s close. Related Link: Airline ETF Seeks To Overcome Transportation Sector Woes This exchange-traded fund tracks a basket of 20 zero-coupon Treasury bonds with an effective duration of 37.26 years. ZROZ has one of the highest sensitivities to long-term interest rates of any fixed-income ETF, which makes it a preferred method of betting against Treasury yields. This fund currently has $107 million in total assets and charges an expense ratio of 0.15 percent. WORST: Junior Gold Miners The rut in gold prices took its toll on smaller mining companies this week. The SPDR Gold Trust (ETF) (NYSE: GLD) fell over 4 percent, which translated to a 14 percent drop in the Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (NYSE: GDXJ). GDXJ tracks 62 small- and mid-cap gold and silver mining companies. This fund has $1.1 billion in total assets and charges an expense ratio of 0.55 percent. Since the start of the year, GDXJ has dropped over 24 percent to hit new multi-year lows and has yet to show any convincing signs of a bottom in place. Most investors won’t be shocked by the extension of this long-term downtrend and sentiment appears to be firmly seated in the bear camp for the time being. Image Credit: Public Domain"
2014-04-18,Morgan Stanley Rates STLD as Overweight,"Analysts at Morgan Stanley on Thursday, April 17, 2014, released their rating on Steel Dynamics (NASDAQ: STLD). Shares of the company are down $0.93 or 4.92 percent to $17.97 per share. The firm is rating the stock Overweight and views it as In-Line. The firm commented, “Fabrication business commentary points to continuing improvements in the non-res construction market. Shipments of premium rail and smaller-diameter SBQ began during the quarter. The benefit to earnings was concealed by weather effects, but should become apparent in the coming quarters. While Mesabi nugget work continues, we will be listening for guidance on what the next steps would be if the trials are unsuccessful.” CFA, Evan L. Kurtz, led the research and has cited STLD's first quarter earnings for 2014 being impacted by poor weather. Steel Dynamics reported first quarter 2014 adjusted earnings per share of $0.16, which was in-line with Morgan Stanley's estimates of $0.15 and the consensus estimate of $0.16 per share. According to Morgan Stanley, Steel Dynamics results were negatively impacted by cold weather, which caused higher energy costs, transportation delays, diminished demand, and lower production due to electricity curtailments. In addition, overall metal margins expanded while street metal margins fell. In addition, according to Morgan Stanley, higher fabrication segment profits suggest underlying conditions are continuing to improve despite poor weather conditions."

2012-03-04,3 important money flow trends from Lipper's Tom Roseen,"by Michael Tarsala Investors closed the month of February with their highest net long exposure in 14 months, according to Lipper data, with last year's sector pariahs seeing some of the largest dollar inflows. I talked to Tom Roseen, Lipper's research director extraordinaire, to help me put the current fund flow trends in context. In the big picture, it's clear that some old trends persist. He says there's still far more inflows in fixed income than equities. And a lot of the new money coming into stocks tends to be directed toward dividend-focused income funds and the international markets. But Roseen noted 3 big changes in the latest weekly data: 1) Large cap funds and ETFs saw $3.5 billion in inflows Source: Lipper Inc. Keep in mind, he says, that this group saw average outflows of $4.2 billion a month last year. In comparison, equity income funds averaged $2.6 billion a month in 2011. So a $3.5 billion inflow in a single week is pretty darn big. It's the largest amount of new money dedicated to the large caps since the week of December 21 (the weekly data is collected on Wednesdays). 2) Domestic funds and ETFs also saw inflows Source: Lipper Inc. The $6.6 billion in inflows for this group was the most since Nov. 9. Roseen is not an economist, mind you, but suggested that better economic news may be behind the increased domestic flow. This week's jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March 2008. 3) Gold ETF shines despite a pullback Source: Lipper Inc. Gold futures retrenched to a 5-week low last week. The metal fell $90 intraday on Wednesday, as traders bet that more Fed stimulus was unlikely. Yet the SPDR Gold ETF (GLD) continued to see inflows, to the tune of $688 million, as of the end of Wednesday. The majority of that inflow seemed to come on the big Wednesday dip, according to the latest from Brendan Conway over at Barron's. Covestor Ltd. is a registered investment advisor.

2019-09-16,"Nucor Lowers Q3 Earnings Guidance, Sees 'Softening' In Some Markets","Nucor Corporation (NYSE:NUE) lowered its earnings guidance for the third quarter ending Sept. 28 on Monday and said it expects earnings to be in the range of 75 cents to 80 cents per diluted share. The news sent shares of steel companies trading lower. Nucor's second-quarter earnings were $1.26 per diluted share, and the guidance also represents a year-over-year decrease from earnings of $2.13 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2018. The performance of the steel mills segment in the third quarter of 2019 is expected to decrease compared to the second quarter of 2019, primarily due to lower prices for sheet and plate steel. “Although we still see stability in most of the end use markets that we serve, there has been some softening in automotive, agricultural products and power transmission markets,” the company said in a statement. Outlook By Segment Nucor said it expects the profitability of the steel products segment to improve sequentially in the third quarter, as nonresidential construction market conditions remain strong. In addition, recently enacted efficiency initiatives in rebar fabrication and metal buildings are enhancing performance from those businesses, the company said. Nucor said the performance of the raw materials segment is expected to decrease in the third quarter due to further margin compression in the company's direct reduced iron businesses. Price Action Nucor shares were trading down 1.06% at the time of publication.

2012-03-14,Cliffs Natural Resources Up 6% After Unveiling New Capital Allocation Strategy,"Shares of Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE: CLF) are up 6% after the company reported a new capital allocation strategy. As part of the plan, the Company's Board of Directors approved a 123% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.625, from the previous quarterly rate of $0.28. The next quarterly dividend at the new rate will be payable on June 1, 2012, to shareholders of record on the close of business on April 29, 2012. The substantial dividend increase reinforces Cliffs' strong outlook for cash generation and commitment to using disciplined capital allocation to drive TSR. While the dividend increase is the first and most immediately visible use of free cash flow, Cliffs' Board of Directors has committed to a new strategic capital allocation process that includes prioritizing all potential uses of future operating cash flow. Cliffs' strategic capital allocation process is comprised of two primary goals: Deploy capital with the objective of driving top-quartile TSR, including a focus on organic growth, dividend distributions and debt reduction; and Provide financial flexibility throughout the business cycle and changes in commodity pricing. Laurie Brlas, Cliffs' executive vice president, finance and administration & chief financial officer, said, This TSR-focused strategy is anticipated to create tangible shareholder value by returning cash to investors, providing a recognized discipline for allocating capital and, at the same time, allowing Cliffs to maintain an exciting pipeline of organic growth. We believe that a philosophical commitment to this payout level and to growing the dividend is manageable through the cycle and sustainable at varying levels of prices for the commodities we sell. Our Board's doubling of the dividend in July 2011 and again in March this year demonstrates this commitment."
2015-12-18,"Why Peter Schiff Sees Gold At $5,000","Peter Schiff of Euro Pacific Capital appeared on CNBC’s Futures Now on Thursday afternoon. The expert defended his prediction that gold is going to $5,000. So, let’s take a look into his arguments. Peter Schiff has been bearish on the economy and bullish on gold for quite a while now. Last month, he told Benzinga the economy is starting to deflate, adding that he expects the Fed to undertake more quantitative easing in 2016. Speaking to CNBC, Schiff explained how he's positioning himself to capitalize on this view. “I don’t tell people to put all their money in gold, he said, I tell people to put some of their money in gold; 5 to 10 percent. And, as you get more money, and if the price of gold comes down, now you can add to it at a better price.” Long-Term Play It’s a long-term play: Prices sometimes go down before going up, he added, assuring the price would still go to $5,000. But, how much lower will gold go before it starts to rise again? Schiff said he doesn't see much more downside because that's already baked into the commodity. “Everybody has been anticipating the Fed was going to raise rates; in fact, they thought the would’ve raised them a lot more than 25 basis points by now. There are still people who think there’s a lot more rate hikes coming. I still believe that’s wrong: people are ignoring the inherent weakness in the US economy and the fact that the Fed is going to be back to its old tricks and only has one game plan for recession, and that’s printing money.” Disclosure: Javier Hasse holds no positions in any of the securities mentioned above."

2020-11-20,KeyBanc Upgrades Cleveland-Cliffs On Opportunities Ahead,"Investors seem to be underappreciating the incremental opportunities ahead for Cleveland-Cliffs Inc (NYSE:CLF), according to KeyBanc Capital Markets. The Cleveland-Cliffs Analyst: Philip Gibbs upgraded Cleveland-Cliffs from Sector Weight to Overweight, while establishing a price target of $12. The Cleveland-Cliffs Thesis: Estimates across the carbon steel group have been raised to reflect positive inflation and the end of the destocking cycle, Gibbs said. He expects “more durable and sustainable EBITDA generation” for Cleveland-Cliffs given the economies of scale due to its recent hot-briquetted iron (HBI) production plant, the acquisition of AK Steel Holding, and the pending purchase of ArcelorMittal’s USA assets. The analyst said the purchase of ArcelorMittal’s USA could drive Cleveland-Cliffs’ stock to between $12 and $16 per share over the next several quarters. “If the deal does not close, CLF would be nearer fair value, as previously noted,” he wrote in the note. Gibbs added that “a pending FCFE machine / freight train in the coming quarters” should “allow the company to deleverage.” CLF Price Action: Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs had risen by 4.6% to $9.30 at the time of publication Friday."

2010-02-12,"Stock Market News for February 12, 2010 - Market News","Reports that European Union leaders had agreed to a Greek bailout plan and a sharp drop in U.S. jobless claims sent U.S. stocks up Thursday, with all the three major indexes recording gains of at least 1%. Data from China that showed a moderating consumer price inflation also helped investors’ sentiments. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 106 points to close up 1.1% at 10,144. The NASDAQ advanced 1.4% at 2177, and the S&P500 gained 10 points, or 1%, to close at 1078. As investors grew comfortable with developments in Europe, expectations for global growth intensified sending crude prices and commodities higher. Volume on the NYSE, nevertheless, remained a modest 1.076 billion shares, with issues that advanced in price beating those that fell by an almost three-to one margin. US Treasuries finished mixed on the session with the 10-year closing off 1/32 and its yield up to 3.734%. Today's premarket futures, however, suggest some weakness on concerns over China's tightening of its monetary policy as well as the euro zone's insignificant fourth-quarter GDP growth of only 0.1%. China raised banks' reserve requirements by another 50bps. Investors therefore will have their focus set on reports of further monetary tightening in Beijing in response to yesterday's report of a lending surge. The developments have sent the US dollar up on its safety play appeal. On Thursday, gains were broad based with only two DJIA components ending the day in the red. Those leading the gains included Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Alcoa (NYSE:AA), and 3M (NYSE:MMM) on their appeal as global economic recovery plays. Shares in Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) jumped 5.6% after a US Department of Agriculture report projected net farm income will gain 12% this year following last year's 35% decline. Shares in Deere (NYSE:DE) rose 4.5% on the news. Bernstein upgraded 3M (NYSE:MMM) to outperform, noting 3M will continue to beat and raise guidance on the back of relative strength in its end markets and competitive positioning. Shares in the company rose 2.1%. All ten S&P 500 industry sectors recorded gains. Basic material shares were the leading gainers, increasing 2.3%, followed by oil and gas (+1.6%), industrials (+1.5%), technology (+1.3%), consumer goods (+1.2%), consumer services (+1.2%), health care (+0.8%), utilities (+0.6%), telecommunications (+0.5%), and financials (+0.3%).

2010-01-12,"Trade Deficit Widens (X, AA)","The U.S. trade balance widened more than expected in November as the deficit grew from $33.2 billion in October to $36.4 billion. The median estimate correctly called the direction of the trade balance improvement, but only expected the deficit to widen $1.7 billion from October's reading. Many economists expected the trade deficit to decline because the dollar has been weak. When the dollar weakens, relatively cheaper exports make U.S. goods more attractive. However, there is a silver lining to the increase in the trade deficit. Many of the raw industrial commodities and capital goods needed for industrial production are imported. The increased demand for these goods reflects a growing manufacturing sector. The report today showed industrial supplies and materials imports rose by $2.1 billion. Capital goods imports increased by $1.2 billion due to higher demand for computers, telecommunications equipment, and electric apparatus. Therefore, if one believes U.S. manufacturing is on the rebound, then one may consider going long names such as U.S. Steel (NYSE: X) or Alcoa (NYSE: AA)."
2012-09-07,September Could be Kind to These ETFs,"On a historical basis, September is usually unkind to stocks and investors have been reminded of that in ample doses since the start of the month. The good news is September's sour reputation does not mean there are not opportunities to be had. In fact, there are a few ETFs that can comfort investors this month. Perhaps the best thing is that the funds on this list are not leveraged, so conservative investors can embrace a couple of these picks, too. Here are the ETFs to be involved with from the long side this month: iShares Gold Trust (NYSE: IAU) Or the SPDR Gold Shares (NYSE: GLD) or any ETF backed by physical gold for that matter. IAU makes the cut here because it has a lower expense ratio than GLD. Additionally, IAU has slightly outperformed GLD year-to-date. Regardless of which gold ETF investors choose, historical data indicate gold is a wise move from the long side this month. In the past 25 Septembers, gold prices have increased 19 times. Factoring in the six years when gold prices slid in September, gold's average September gain is almost 2.7 percent, according to Dorsey Wright. iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index Fund (NYSE: IYR) The real estate sector has been a decent performer over the past 20 Septembers, rising 12 times and falling on eight occasions. The average gain in the 12 up Septembers outpaces the average loss by 50 basis points, according to Dorsey Wright. IYR is already up 17.3 percent year-to-date and that might imply the fund is due for a September pullback. Past performance probably is not the biggest near-term risk facing this ETF. Valuation might be. IYR sports a P/E ratio of almost 45 and a price/book ratio of nearly 3.5, according to iShares data. On the other hand, a 30-day SEC yield of 3.56 percent is decent in this environment and that could be enough to send yield-hungry investors into this fund as September moves along. U.S. Oil Fund (NYSE: USO) Embracing a risky asset such as oil futures would appear to be the opposite of what would be deemed a practical September. The data support such a move. Over the past 16 Septembers, oil futures have risen nine times and fallen seven times. Not a big margin favor of the bulls, but the Dorsey Wright data indicate crude's average gain over those nine Septembers is 120 basis points better than the average loss. PowerShares DWA Technical Leaders Portfolio (NYSE: PDP) The PowerShares DWA Technical Leaders Portfolio tracks an index based on relative strength methodology, which is to say the ETF is home to 101 stocks showing bullish relative strength characteristics. On the surface, PDP would be appear to be a fund more geared toward a risk on environment because consumer discretionary and financial services names combine for almost 50 percent of the ETF's weight. The index has jumped in 10 of the past 15 Septembers, though it should be noted the average loss in the five down Septembers is much higher than the average gain. PDP has almost $617 million in assets under management and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the ETF's largest holding with an allocation of 3.53 percent. For more on ETFs, click here."
2015-04-09,Alcoa CEO: We Are Creating Two Pronged Value Engines,"Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA) came out with better than expected quarterly numbers on Wednesday on back of a turnaround in the company's smelting business. The company reported EPS of $0.14 for the quarter, compared to a loss of $0.16 in the same quarter last year. Revenue for the quarter came at $5.82 billion a 6.7 percent year-over-year increase. Alcoa chairman and CEO Klaus Kleinfeld was on CNBC recently to discuss the quarterly results. Strong Operational Performance Let's characterize the quarter, Kleinfeld said. I think you see it's a strong operational performance on the quarter and the transformation is really well on track. Looking at the revenues, revenues year on year up 7 percent, mainly driven by organic growth in the auto as well as in the aero sector that's what happening then. Kleinfeld continued, Then when you lift the hood on the profit side, you see a record performance on the upstream side again; super good first-quarter and you see a very, very good performance on the downstream side. Then you look at the transformation, you see Firth Rixson integration well under way, […] same thing, RTI going in the right direction and then we transform the upstream portfolio to make it more competitive and I think this shines through very, very nicely in this first quarter. Creating Value On why Alcoa is not spinning off its upstream business, Kleinfeld said, We have an obligation from our shareholders to make the best value out of the portfolio that we have and when you look at what we are doing, we are creating this two pronged value engines …both of these value engines are helping to create the value so and I think you see this very, very clearly in this quarter."

2023-08-04,Apple On Track For The Worst Revenue Decline Streak In Two Decades And Interest Rates Rise - Momo Crowd Does Not Care,"To gain an edge, this is what you need to know today. Long Yields Rise Please click here for a chart of iShares 20 Plus Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT). Note the following: The chart shows that long bonds are falling because yields on long bonds are rising. Bonds trade inverse to the yield. The trendline on the chart shows that TLT had been making lower highs prior to the sudden drop. The chart shows that TLT has now fallen below the prior support zone, which has now become the resistance zone. The chart shows the next support zone. RSI on the chart shows that TLT is way oversold. An oversold condition can lead to a quick bounce, but the bounce may not be sustainable in view of the huge supply of Treasury bonds. As a member of The Arora Report, you knew in advance that this was likely to happen due to increased borrowing by the U.S. We previously wrote: In The Arora Report analysis, here is an important piece of new data that prudent investors should pay attention to. The U.S. Treasury Department has announced that it plans to borrow about $1T in the third quarter. This is the largest amount ever to be borrowed by the U.S. in any third quarter. More importantly, the amount to be borrowed is about $200B more than the prior estimates. Along with the rise in yields on U.S. government bonds, yields on government bonds across the globe are rising. Traditionally when yields rise, stocks fall. The reason is that stocks compete with bonds. When yields rise, bonds become more attractive. Since technology stocks tend to be long duration stocks, historically, they are impacted negatively more than other stocks by rising yields. To develop an in-depth understanding of how it all works, listen to the podcast titled “Be Careful With Popular Long Duration Stocks.” In addition to this podcast, there are several other podcasts in Arora Ambassador Club that give you in-depth knowledge on the subject. Rising yields were responsible for the significant drop in technology stocks and the bear market in 2022. In 2023, investor exuberance over AI became so great that investors stopped caring about the yields. As a result, the historical relationship between stocks and bonds broke. Will the historical relationship reassert itself? Here are the key points from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings: Apple earnings were slightly below the consensus and significantly below the whisper numbers. Apple revenues declined for the third quarter in a row. Apple is on track for declining revenues in this quarter. This will make the worst revenue decline streak for Apple in two decades. iPhone sales declined. On the positive side, service revenues reached an all time high of $21B. Apple now has one billion customers for its services. Apple sales in India hit a record. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) earnings were significantly better than consensus and slightly better than the whisper numbers. Both Apple and Amazon hyped AI in their conference calls. However, considering the huge investment AI needs, neither company seems to have a clear map to profit from AI. In The Arora Report analysis, right now investors are not looking ahead, and the AI frenzy is so hyped up that investors don't even ask how these companies will profit from AI. In due course, this will change. Stock futures fell after the release of Apple earnings along with AAPL stock. Subsequently, the People's Bank of China said that it would increase funding support for the private sector. The statement from China, not only caused a rally in Chinese stocks, it caused a significant rally in U.S. stock futures. Stock futures started pulling back in anticipation of the jobs report and continue to slightly pullback after the jobs report. The jobs report is mixed. Here are the details: Non-farm private payrolls came at 172K vs. 175K consensus. Headline non-farm payrolls came at 187K vs. 200K consensus. Hourly earnings came at 0.4% vs. 0.3% consensus. Average work week came at 34.3 vs. 34.4 consensus. The foregoing illustrates the advantage of an adaptive model that changes itself with market conditions. Most models on Wall Street are static. They work for a while and then they stop working when market conditions change. The highly successful ZYX Asset Allocation Model with inputs in ten categories and a long track record of hundreds of accurate calls in both bull and bear markets is an adaptive model. Here are two examples to consider: In the past, there was a time when Apple revenues declined for one quarter and the stock was cut in half. Now, Apple is on track for declining revenues for four quarters in a row and Apple stock is up 52% this year. This is where buy zones from The Arora Report absolutely shine. The chart shows the Arora buy zone, which allowed members of The Arora Report to buy Apple near the lows and experience large gains. Last year, technology stocks were hit hard because interest rates were rising. This year, nobody cares. As an actionable item, the sum total of the foregoing is in the protection band, which strikes the optimum balance between various crosscurrents. Please scroll down to see the protection band. Magnificent Seven Money Flows Money flows in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon, and Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) are positive in the earning trade. Money flows in Apple, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are negative in the early trade. Money flows in Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (NASDAQ:QQQ) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) are mixed. Momo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks The momo crowd is buying stocks in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. Gold The momo crowd is buying gold in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see gold and silver ratings. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (NYSE:GLD). The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV). Oil The momo crowd is buying oil in the early trade. Smart money is inactive in the early trade. For longer-term, please see oil ratings. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (ASCA: USO). Bitcoin Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) is range bound. Markets Our very, very short-term early stock market indicator is neutral. This indicator, with a great track record, is popular among long term investors to stay in tune with the market and among short term traders to independently undertake quick trades. Protection Band And What To Do Now It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding 🔒 in cash or Treasury bills or allocated to short-term tactical trades; and short to medium-term hedges of 🔒, and short term hedges of 🔒. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time. To see the locked content, please click here to start a free trial. You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges. It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market. Traditional 60/40 Portfolio Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time. Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time. The Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

2010-08-03,"Citi Rates Vulcan Hold, Has $47 Price Target (VMC)","Citi Investment Research is rating shares of Vulcan Materials Co (NYSE: VMC) a Hold and has a $47 price target after the industrial company reported weak earnings yesterday. In the report Citi Investment Research writes, We rate Vulcan Hold/High Risk (2H). While we continue to believe that the favourable long-term pricing story for aggregates remains in place, near-term trading conditions remain weak. Fiscal stimulus money and better residential markets will help this year, but private non-res and state work will continue to be a drag. In the medium to longer term, Vulcan's strategically positioned quarries provide it with a valuable and attractive asset from which to deliver value over the coming years. A stronger balance sheet reduces the financial risks within the group and puts more emphasis on the trading outlook for volumes and pricing. Near-term trading newsflow is expected to remain poor, but volumes and pricing may start to recover more meaningfully into 2011 and then the expected, significant leverage should be enjoyed. Shares of Vulcan Materials are down $3.66 to 43.19."
2011-09-13,This Chart  Continues To Dominate Every Market Move,"Yesterday's late afternoon rally was being accredited to the Chinese buying Italian debt. Whether or not this is true remains to be seen. What is true and did happen was the late afternoon decline in the U.S. Dollar Index. As we all know by now, when the U.S. Dollar Index dips the major stock market indexes flip. Everything inflated higher yesterday afternoon as the U.S. Dollar Index declined into the closing bell. Traders and investors must continue to follow the U.S. Dollar Index very closely once the opening bell rings at the New York Stock Exchange each and everyday. The energy and commodity sectors are most sensitive to the U.S. Dollar Index. Stocks such as Southern Copper Corp.(NYSE: SCCO), Nucor Corp.(NYSE: NUE), and U.S. Steel Corp.(NYSE: X) will usually trade inverse to the U.S. Dollar Index. This morning, all of these stocks are just stalling after advancing higher yesterday afternoon. Should the U.S. Dollar Index begin to move higher this morning it would be prudent to expect these stocks to pullback or decline intra-day. The U.S. Dollar Index futures (DX U1) will have some short term intra-day support around the $$76.80 level. Nicholas Santiago InTheMoneyStocks.com"

2010-12-13,Time To Look At Alcoa?,"Alcoa Inc. (NYSE: AA) is slightly up in pre-market trading, but the bigger move here is for 2011, when analysts expect aluminum demand to rise sharply. Alcoa, being one of the worlds largest producers of aluminum, could very well be a huge beneficiary of the increased demand, and shareholders should benefit handsomely. Stockcall.com writes, Aluminum producers like Alcoa Inc. are looking to 2011 positively, as a number of beneficial influences could be poised to improve the industry outlook. The supply and demand equation has been trending to demand dominance recently, as China has curbed production for environmental reasons. The growing middle classes of India and South America are also stretching supplies, as construction and the number of individuals driving automobiles is increasing fast. Other companies to consider are Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO), as it owns Alcan, another large aluminum producer, as well as Chinalco (NYSE: ACH), which is China's largest aluminum producer.
